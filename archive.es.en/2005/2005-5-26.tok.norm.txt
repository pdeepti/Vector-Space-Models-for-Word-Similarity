other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .
european economic policymakers are already struggling with weak growth , strained public finances , stalled reforms and generally rock-bottom credibility , which daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , warned was likely to suffer even further in the case of a " no . "
" what little credibility that might have been left will be further damaged , " he told afp .
" yes " camp 's hopes rest on undecided voters despite ten consecutive polls that show the naysayers ahead , the constitution 's supporters have also not given up on the slim chance french voters could still approve the draft , which would give rise to a collective sigh of relief from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the french wo n't make up their minds until they get to the ballot box between 20 percent and 25 percent of france 42 million voters , who are famous for making up their mind at the last minute , admit they may still change their vote before going to the polls , according to recent surveys .
in a race with the two sides separated by between six percent and eight percent , undecided voters will make all the difference .
other treaties have also been rejected france , however , is n't the last obstacle in the constitution 's path .
three days after the french go to the polls , the dutch will be asked their opinion and referendums will also take place in luxembourg , denmark , poland , portugal , ireland , the czech republic and britain by the end of 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende 's countrymen will vote on the eu constitution june 1 legally , it doesn ’ t matter if it 's france or a smaller eu member state like denmark that scuttles the constitution , since the draft must be ratified by all 25 eu member states before it can go into effect .
but eu council president jean-claude juncker hopes other member states will ratify the constitution , even if the french or dutch cast it aside .
" i find it quite extraordinary to say to other people that they can stay at home , because france has decided for the others , " he said wednesday in an interview with the belgian daily le soir .
" if it 's ' yes ' we will say , let 's go on ; if it 's ' no ' we will say , let 's continue . "
rejection in a smaller country could be reversed with a second trip to the polls , as happened with in ireland with the nice treaty in 2001 .
but that 's a step french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin has ruled out .
" france will express itself , it will express itself once , " he told the bbc .
" there will be no second round or second chance .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times . " we 've noticed that a certain religious inclination is finding far greater expression these days than in previous years , " said heike krohn from the berlin and brandenburg lutheran church in an interview with the berliner morgenpost daily . " there 's been a conspicuous rise in interest , " she said , pointing out that the church has been welcoming a surprising number of new members . what christianity really means but even more people are leaving it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .
european economic policymakers are already struggling with weak growth , strained public finances , stalled reforms and generally rock-bottom credibility , which daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , warned was likely to suffer even further in the case of a " no . "
" what little credibility that might have been left will be further damaged , " he told afp .
" yes " camp 's hopes rest on undecided voters despite ten consecutive polls that show the naysayers ahead , the constitution 's supporters have also not given up on the slim chance french voters could still approve the draft , which would give rise to a collective sigh of relief from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the french wo n't make up their minds until they get to the ballot box between 20 percent and 25 percent of france 42 million voters , who are famous for making up their mind at the last minute , admit they may still change their vote before going to the polls , according to recent surveys .
in a race with the two sides separated by between six percent and eight percent , undecided voters will make all the difference .
other treaties have also been rejected france , however , is n't the last obstacle in the constitution 's path .
three days after the french go to the polls , the dutch will be asked their opinion and referendums will also take place in luxembourg , denmark , poland , portugal , ireland , the czech republic and britain by the end of 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende 's countrymen will vote on the eu constitution june 1 legally , it doesn ’ t matter if it 's france or a smaller eu member state like denmark that scuttles the constitution , since the draft must be ratified by all 25 eu member states before it can go into effect .
but eu council president jean-claude juncker hopes other member states will ratify the constitution , even if the french or dutch cast it aside .
" i find it quite extraordinary to say to other people that they can stay at home , because france has decided for the others , " he said wednesday in an interview with the belgian daily le soir .
" if it 's ' yes ' we will say , let 's go on ; if it 's ' no ' we will say , let 's continue . "
rejection in a smaller country could be reversed with a second trip to the polls , as happened with in ireland with the nice treaty in 2001 .
but that 's a step french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin has ruled out .
" france will express itself , it will express itself once , " he told the bbc .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- general director supachai panitchpakdi , right , from thailand in 1999 the wto was unable to agree upon a candidate for its director general .
after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- general director supachai panitchpakdi , right , from thailand in 1999 the wto was unable to agree upon a candidate for its director general .
after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .
the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits .

schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party .

" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .

schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party .

" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .

schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 early elections may help german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new government will have to make job creation its top priority the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .
the years of 3 percent growth were gone and in the future germany would be lucky to expand at a rate of 1.5 percent , he said .
at best , all politicians in berlin can hope to do is to limit the damage . michael knigge -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd predicts slower growth for germany the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .

the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .

after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .

the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .

but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .

many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament .

a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .

though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 early elections may help german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new government will have to make job creation its top priority the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed .

but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .

many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .
recent attacks by müntefering on supposedly unbridled capitalist principles could return in campaign rhetoric . that could placate several high-profile spd left-wingers , who , for the moment , appear prepared to stay in the party and fight for it to turn away from schröder 's reform course . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .

after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .

" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .

many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- general director supachai panitchpakdi , right , from thailand in 1999 the wto was unable to agree upon a candidate for its director general .
after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .
the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .
though he was instrumental in brokering last summer 's reform of eu farm subsidies , lamy has also spearheaded european resistance to such change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display two mock playing cards during a rally friday , april 15 , 2005 in manila , philippines , opposing the forthcoming world trade organizations conferences .
many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times . " we 've noticed that a certain religious inclination is finding far greater expression these days than in previous years , " said heike krohn from the berlin and brandenburg lutheran church in an interview with the berliner morgenpost daily . " there 's been a conspicuous rise in interest , " she said , pointing out that the church has been welcoming a surprising number of new members . what christianity really means but even more people are leaving it .
in 2003 , some 1,424 people joined the church , compared to 11,232 who turned their back on it .
even so , the situation 's not as bad as it looks .
11 years previously , 43,508 people became lapsed christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is witnessing a similar trend .
in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , it saw the number of church-leavers fall from 14,500 in 1990 to 3000 in 2002 . " a lot of religious communities are asking themselves what christianity really means , " stefan förner , spokesman with the berlin archbishopric , told the morgenpost .
one factor , he said , is the recent appointment of pope benedict xvi .
" there was a rise of re-entries and conversions in the period just before and after his election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide expected french ' non ' hits euro courting the constitution europe -pipe- 26.05.2005 europe can weather constitution refusal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oui or non , the french vote will determine the eu 's next steps politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .
european economic policymakers are already struggling with weak growth , strained public finances , stalled reforms and generally rock-bottom credibility , which daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , warned was likely to suffer even further in the case of a " no . "
" what little credibility that might have been left will be further damaged , " he told afp .
" yes " camp 's hopes rest on undecided voters despite ten consecutive polls that show the naysayers ahead , the constitution 's supporters have also not given up on the slim chance french voters could still approve the draft , which would give rise to a collective sigh of relief from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the french wo n't make up their minds until they get to the ballot box between 20 percent and 25 percent of france 42 million voters , who are famous for making up their mind at the last minute , admit they may still change their vote before going to the polls , according to recent surveys .
in a race with the two sides separated by between six percent and eight percent , undecided voters will make all the difference .
other treaties have also been rejected france , however , is n't the last obstacle in the constitution 's path .
three days after the french go to the polls , the dutch will be asked their opinion and referendums will also take place in luxembourg , denmark , poland , portugal , ireland , the czech republic and britain by the end of 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende 's countrymen will vote on the eu constitution june 1 legally , it doesn ’ t matter if it 's france or a smaller eu member state like denmark that scuttles the constitution , since the draft must be ratified by all 25 eu member states before it can go into effect .
but eu council president jean-claude juncker hopes other member states will ratify the constitution , even if the french or dutch cast it aside .
" i find it quite extraordinary to say to other people that they can stay at home , because france has decided for the others , " he said wednesday in an interview with the belgian daily le soir .
" if it 's ' yes ' we will say , let 's go on ; if it 's ' no ' we will say , let 's continue . "
rejection in a smaller country could be reversed with a second trip to the polls , as happened with in ireland with the nice treaty in 2001 .
but that 's a step french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin has ruled out .
" france will express itself , it will express itself once , " he told the bbc .
" there will be no second round or second chance .
once she has spoken , her message is clear . " sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide expected french ' non ' hits euro courting the constitution europe -pipe- 26.05.2005 europe can weather constitution refusal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oui or non , the french vote will determine the eu 's next steps politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .
european economic policymakers are already struggling with weak growth , strained public finances , stalled reforms and generally rock-bottom credibility , which daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , warned was likely to suffer even further in the case of a " no . "
" what little credibility that might have been left will be further damaged , " he told afp .
" yes " camp 's hopes rest on undecided voters despite ten consecutive polls that show the naysayers ahead , the constitution 's supporters have also not given up on the slim chance french voters could still approve the draft , which would give rise to a collective sigh of relief from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the french wo n't make up their minds until they get to the ballot box between 20 percent and 25 percent of france 42 million voters , who are famous for making up their mind at the last minute , admit they may still change their vote before going to the polls , according to recent surveys .
in a race with the two sides separated by between six percent and eight percent , undecided voters will make all the difference .
other treaties have also been rejected france , however , is n't the last obstacle in the constitution 's path .
three days after the french go to the polls , the dutch will be asked their opinion and referendums will also take place in luxembourg , denmark , poland , portugal , ireland , the czech republic and britain by the end of 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende 's countrymen will vote on the eu constitution june 1 legally , it doesn ’ t matter if it 's france or a smaller eu member state like denmark that scuttles the constitution , since the draft must be ratified by all 25 eu member states before it can go into effect .
but eu council president jean-claude juncker hopes other member states will ratify the constitution , even if the french or dutch cast it aside .
" i find it quite extraordinary to say to other people that they can stay at home , because france has decided for the others , " he said wednesday in an interview with the belgian daily le soir .
" if it 's ' yes ' we will say , let 's go on ; if it 's ' no ' we will say , let 's continue . "
rejection in a smaller country could be reversed with a second trip to the polls , as happened with in ireland with the nice treaty in 2001 .
but that 's a step french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin has ruled out .
" france will express itself , it will express itself once , " he told the bbc .
" there will be no second round or second chance .
once she has spoken , her message is clear . " sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 europe 's lamy named new wto leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's got the job , and a lot on his plate after a process lasting several months , pascal lamy has been appointed director-general of the world trade organization .
the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- general director supachai panitchpakdi , right , from thailand in 1999 the wto was unable to agree upon a candidate for its director general .
after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .
the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .

each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .

the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .

the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .

" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .

german unions had said they feared 2,500 jobs were at risk , representing 10 percent of ibm 's workforce in germany , but an ibm spokesman said that figure was " clearly exaggerated " .
the service union verdi said it expected around 1,600 jobs to go .
" it should be decided by the end of june , " said rolf schmidt , subsidiary ibm germany 's link man with the unions .
the figure of 1,600 includes 580 job losses already announced by ibm germany which will be achieved by closing the ibm business services subsidiary which has offices in schweinfurt and hanover .
financial times deutschland said on thursday that the total job losses would be around 1,280 , but a company spokesman refused to confirm that figure .
ibm announced this month that it had planned to cut its 329,000-strong workforce through " voluntary and involuntary " cuts of 10,000 to 13,000 employees worldwide .
the company nicknamed " big blue " had shocked wall street with disappointing earnings figures last month , signalling that the job cuts were part of efforts to reinvent itself after it sold its personal computer unit . dw-world.de ibm job cuts concentrated in europe ibm 's announcement this week that it would cut up to 13,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring has particularly gloomy consequences for the eu as most of the cost-saving measures target the firm 's european operations .

german unions had said they feared 2,500 jobs were at risk , representing 10 percent of ibm 's workforce in germany , but an ibm spokesman said that figure was " clearly exaggerated " .
the service union verdi said it expected around 1,600 jobs to go .
" it should be decided by the end of june , " said rolf schmidt , subsidiary ibm germany 's link man with the unions .
the figure of 1,600 includes 580 job losses already announced by ibm germany which will be achieved by closing the ibm business services subsidiary which has offices in schweinfurt and hanover .
financial times deutschland said on thursday that the total job losses would be around 1,280 , but a company spokesman refused to confirm that figure .
ibm announced this month that it had planned to cut its 329,000-strong workforce through " voluntary and involuntary " cuts of 10,000 to 13,000 employees worldwide .
the company nicknamed " big blue " had shocked wall street with disappointing earnings figures last month , signalling that the job cuts were part of efforts to reinvent itself after it sold its personal computer unit . dw-world.de ibm job cuts concentrated in europe ibm 's announcement this week that it would cut up to 13,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring has particularly gloomy consequences for the eu as most of the cost-saving measures target the firm 's european operations .

the carrier , which is partly owned by lufthansa , will offer flights to 10 foreign and domestic destinations from the german capital 's schönefeld airport this year .
new destinations include stockholm , moscow , zagreb , split , istanbul and ankara . germanwings ceo joachim klein said on wednesday the airline wanted to double the number of cities it flies to by 2007 .
the expansion will create 120 new jobs , he added .
germanwings , which is based in cologne , hopes to boost passenger numbers in berlin in 2005 to over one million .
following the arrival of easyjet at schönefeld in recent years , berlin has quickly become a hub for budget airline offerings , threatening lufthansa 's market share . dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .
the paradox has environmentalists and rail officials upset .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution courting the constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back business -pipe- 26.05.2005 expected french ' non ' hits euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy . the euro slumped to 1.2505 dollars , its lowest level since october 20 , but rose to 1.2510 in late european trading from a high point of 1.2619 dollars on wednesday .
the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

german unions had said they feared 2,500 jobs were at risk , representing 10 percent of ibm 's workforce in germany , but an ibm spokesman said that figure was " clearly exaggerated " .
the service union verdi said it expected around 1,600 jobs to go .
" it should be decided by the end of june , " said rolf schmidt , subsidiary ibm germany 's link man with the unions .
the figure of 1,600 includes 580 job losses already announced by ibm germany which will be achieved by closing the ibm business services subsidiary which has offices in schweinfurt and hanover .
financial times deutschland said on thursday that the total job losses would be around 1,280 , but a company spokesman refused to confirm that figure .
ibm announced this month that it had planned to cut its 329,000-strong workforce through " voluntary and involuntary " cuts of 10,000 to 13,000 employees worldwide .
the company nicknamed " big blue " had shocked wall street with disappointing earnings figures last month , signalling that the job cuts were part of efforts to reinvent itself after it sold its personal computer unit . dw-world.de ibm job cuts concentrated in europe ibm 's announcement this week that it would cut up to 13,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring has particularly gloomy consequences for the eu as most of the cost-saving measures target the firm 's european operations .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .

schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party .

" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .

schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .

each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .

educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .
though he was instrumental in brokering last summer 's reform of eu farm subsidies , lamy has also spearheaded european resistance to such change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display two mock playing cards during a rally friday , april 15 , 2005 in manila , philippines , opposing the forthcoming world trade organizations conferences .
many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times . " we 've noticed that a certain religious inclination is finding far greater expression these days than in previous years , " said heike krohn from the berlin and brandenburg lutheran church in an interview with the berliner morgenpost daily . " there 's been a conspicuous rise in interest , " she said , pointing out that the church has been welcoming a surprising number of new members . what christianity really means but even more people are leaving it .
in 2003 , some 1,424 people joined the church , compared to 11,232 who turned their back on it .
even so , the situation 's not as bad as it looks .
11 years previously , 43,508 people became lapsed christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is witnessing a similar trend .
in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , it saw the number of church-leavers fall from 14,500 in 1990 to 3000 in 2002 . " a lot of religious communities are asking themselves what christianity really means , " stefan förner , spokesman with the berlin archbishopric , told the morgenpost .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .

this saturday , schalke 04 and champion 's fc bayern munich will match up for the last time this season .
at stake : the german cup . there is really little love lost between these two teams . their managers use the nation 's biggest tabloid to bicker and complain about one another and the coaches are n't immune to a little one-upmanship either . but bayern and schalke 04 probably see it as their right to act like big shots . with their large fan base and massive budgets that helped them to a one-two finish this season , they certainly are the biggest thing in the bundesliga at the moment . on saturday , the two will end a season of tough bundesliga competition by fighting for the german cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
organizers are expecting a capacity crowd at the refurbished stadium , which now holds up to 75,000 people .
this year will mark the 14th time bayern has competed for the trophy in germany 's top tournament , winning 12 of them .

but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament .

a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .

though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .

other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .
european economic policymakers are already struggling with weak growth , strained public finances , stalled reforms and generally rock-bottom credibility , which daniel gros , director of the center for european policy studies , warned was likely to suffer even further in the case of a " no . "
" what little credibility that might have been left will be further damaged , " he told afp .
" yes " camp 's hopes rest on undecided voters despite ten consecutive polls that show the naysayers ahead , the constitution 's supporters have also not given up on the slim chance french voters could still approve the draft , which would give rise to a collective sigh of relief from brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the french wo n't make up their minds until they get to the ballot box between 20 percent and 25 percent of france 42 million voters , who are famous for making up their mind at the last minute , admit they may still change their vote before going to the polls , according to recent surveys .
in a race with the two sides separated by between six percent and eight percent , undecided voters will make all the difference .
other treaties have also been rejected france , however , is n't the last obstacle in the constitution 's path .
three days after the french go to the polls , the dutch will be asked their opinion and referendums will also take place in luxembourg , denmark , poland , portugal , ireland , the czech republic and britain by the end of 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende 's countrymen will vote on the eu constitution june 1 legally , it doesn ’ t matter if it 's france or a smaller eu member state like denmark that scuttles the constitution , since the draft must be ratified by all 25 eu member states before it can go into effect .
but eu council president jean-claude juncker hopes other member states will ratify the constitution , even if the french or dutch cast it aside .
" i find it quite extraordinary to say to other people that they can stay at home , because france has decided for the others , " he said wednesday in an interview with the belgian daily le soir .
" if it 's ' yes ' we will say , let 's go on ; if it 's ' no ' we will say , let 's continue . "
rejection in a smaller country could be reversed with a second trip to the polls , as happened with in ireland with the nice treaty in 2001 .
but that 's a step french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin has ruled out .
" france will express itself , it will express itself once , " he told the bbc .
" there will be no second round or second chance .
once she has spoken , her message is clear . " sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- courting the constitution europe is no leader in the game of creating hot gossip but the constitution sure has the continent chattering .
the question is , does anyone really know what their tongues are wagging about ?
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

this saturday , schalke 04 and champion 's fc bayern munich will match up for the last time this season .
at stake : the german cup . there is really little love lost between these two teams . their managers use the nation 's biggest tabloid to bicker and complain about one another and the coaches are n't immune to a little one-upmanship either . but bayern and schalke 04 probably see it as their right to act like big shots . with their large fan base and massive budgets that helped them to a one-two finish this season , they certainly are the biggest thing in the bundesliga at the moment . on saturday , the two will end a season of tough bundesliga competition by fighting for the german cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
organizers are expecting a capacity crowd at the refurbished stadium , which now holds up to 75,000 people .
this year will mark the 14th time bayern has competed for the trophy in germany 's top tournament , winning 12 of them .
schalke last won in 2001 and 2002 , and his competed four times altogether . bildunterschrift : who will get to kiss the cup next ? taking it easy ? " it has long been my goal to be here , " said bayern coach felix magath , who has the opportunity to complete his first season by winning a domestic double .
" it 's the high point of the career of any player or coach . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick has had a good start in his first season at schalke schalke 's ralf rangnick -lrb- photo -rrb- said that after competing viciously with bayern for the league title and qualifying itself for the champion 's league , the club can take time to enjoy their final match of the season .
" still , i 'm sure that we 're motivated enough to win the final , " he added , at the joint press conference between the two this week . motivational bickering the two were a bit punchier earlier this week , giving the media plenty to print in the run-up to the final .
magath -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose team lost both matches with schalke this season , said his team was better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath lead his team to the title in his first year as coach " schalke ca n't always get so lucky , " he said .
manager uli honess said it was " unthinkable that a team like schalke 04 should beat bayern three times " in one year .
rangnick thanked hoeness for the words of motivation , adding that he did n't really need to add much in order to fire up his players .
" according to bayern , we should n't even bother showing up , " rangnick said .
" but they were just as optimistic before our games in the bundesliga . " arriving in style both sides finished the season on a high note .
bayern mopped up struggling vfb stuttgart , which was fighting for third place , by a score of 3-1 .
striker and dutch international roy makaay has shown recently that he is top form adding a few goals and assists in the final weeks to give him the overall scorer 's title .
michael ballack continues the strong form he has displayed all season and his midfielding partner sebastian deisler has ended a season in which he suffered from psychological problems on a high note , scoring some nifty goals in the final games . schalke , too , has much to be pleased about .
after losing steam in the race to unseat bayern as champion 's , the blue-collar team from the former mining town of gelsenkirchen was in danger of giving up second place and its spot in the champion 's league tournament .
but schalke slipped by bottom-feeders sc freiburg on a goal by marcelo bordon -lrb- photo -rrb- in the 89th minute , to win 3-2 and secure second place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's marcelo jose bordon celebrates after scoring the winning goal . the " royal blues " expect to elevate their game , as they always seem to do , against their favorite nemesis . " if bayern wants to beat us , they have to be better than we are , " said schalke striker gerald asamoah .

dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us .

the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .
the ecb has held its key interest rates steady at 2.0 pct since june 2003 . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ministers admit divergent euro zone fears confusion and concern seemed to be the emotions of the day as the eu finance ministers stepped out of a meeting in luxembourg on friday after discussing divergent growth rates in the euro zone .
-lrb- march 13 , 2005 -rrb- europe can weather constitution refusal politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .

after a lengthy , bitter battle , the organization finally split the post between mike moore of new zealand and supachai panitchpadki -lrb- photo -rrb- of thailand .
each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .
the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .
though he was instrumental in brokering last summer 's reform of eu farm subsidies , lamy has also spearheaded european resistance to such change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display two mock playing cards during a rally friday , april 15 , 2005 in manila , philippines , opposing the forthcoming world trade organizations conferences .
many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .
recent attacks by müntefering on supposedly unbridled capitalist principles could return in campaign rhetoric . that could placate several high-profile spd left-wingers , who , for the moment , appear prepared to stay in the party and fight for it to turn away from schröder 's reform course . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

but some worry that he might not be up to the stress of a gruelling campaign . a famously enthusiastic marathon runner , the much-maligned foreign minister is looking increasingly like he just ca n't take the pace . in the last two years , he 's ballooned some 20 kilos -lrb- about 40 pounds -rrb- , and party colleagues were recently quoted in the daily süddeutsche zeitung as saying they were n't sure the man usually described as the greens ' trump card will be able to withstand the physical rigors of a general election . " an election campaign can have adverse affects on the heart and blood pressure , " cardiologist professor rudolf blasini told bild tabloid . adding pounds , losing votes bildunterschrift : from fat to thin to fat : joschka fischer dubbed " yo-yo joschka " on account of his forever-fluctuating weight , fischer has certainly seen leaner days . in 1998 , when germany 's first left-of-center government of social democrats and the environmental greens party came to power , he was in top form , even publishing a book entitled " my long run towards myself " about his struggle to stay fit .
the dedication he demonstrated as an athlete was widely seen as testimony to his political stamina . but the temptations of the bundestag buffet - not to mention all those endless diplomatic dinners - have taken their toll on the notorious gourmet and bon vivant . these days , the paparazzi are more likely to spot the portly politician enjoying meals at berlin 's best restaurants with his young companion , minu barati , than pounding the pavements as a sweat-drenched long-distance runner .
some have joked that the german vice chancellor is working on a sequel to his book : " my long run around myself " salad days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fisher -lrb- center -rrb- filling out his overall during a visit to thailand in january following the tsunami disaster fischer 's weight has been variously described as a barometer of his party 's fortunes and an indication of his chameleon-like ability to reinvent himself . so can joschka transform back into the debonair diplomat of the past ?
the green party certainly hopes so - if joschka fischer is n't at his best , their campaign is lost .

but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .

a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 early elections may help german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new government will have to make job creation its top priority the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .
the years of 3 percent growth were gone and in the future germany would be lucky to expand at a rate of 1.5 percent , he said .
at best , all politicians in berlin can hope to do is to limit the damage . michael knigge -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd predicts slower growth for germany the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times . " we 've noticed that a certain religious inclination is finding far greater expression these days than in previous years , " said heike krohn from the berlin and brandenburg lutheran church in an interview with the berliner morgenpost daily . " there 's been a conspicuous rise in interest , " she said , pointing out that the church has been welcoming a surprising number of new members . what christianity really means but even more people are leaving it .
in 2003 , some 1,424 people joined the church , compared to 11,232 who turned their back on it .
even so , the situation 's not as bad as it looks .
11 years previously , 43,508 people became lapsed christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is witnessing a similar trend .
in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , it saw the number of church-leavers fall from 14,500 in 1990 to 3000 in 2002 . " a lot of religious communities are asking themselves what christianity really means , " stefan förner , spokesman with the berlin archbishopric , told the morgenpost .
one factor , he said , is the recent appointment of pope benedict xvi .
" there was a rise of re-entries and conversions in the period just before and after his election . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for sale : holy space , cheap as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- back to belief in german schools last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief .
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- new pope delights and disappoints around the world , presidents and religious leaders have hailed joseph ratzinger 's election as pope benedict xvi .
but liberals among the faithful fear the new pontiff will bring little reform .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .
recent attacks by müntefering on supposedly unbridled capitalist principles could return in campaign rhetoric . that could placate several high-profile spd left-wingers , who , for the moment , appear prepared to stay in the party and fight for it to turn away from schröder 's reform course . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

they can now keep the european cup after winning it for the fifth time the 2005 champions league final in istanbul will go down as one of the most dramatic ever .
liverpool , four time winners of the european cup , found themselves 3-0 down at half-time after goals by paolo maldini and two by hernan crespo had put a vastly superior milan side in total control .
maldini's goal was the fastest ever in a champions league final .
it looked all over for the reds but liverpool coach rafa benitez must have found some magic words to say in the changing room .
his team came out and launched as sensational comeback .
bildunterschrift : liverpool 's goalkeepr jerzy dudek earned liverpool a penalty shootout victory captain steve gerrard pulled one back with a magnificent header .
minutes later vladimir smicer's shot evaded milan keeper dida to make it 2-3 .
liverpool were hardly recognizable now and when steve gerrard was brought down by gennaro gattuso the reds were poised to equalize .
xabi alonso stepped up to take the penalty but dida saved .
alonso however , reacted quickly and scored from the rebound to make it 3-3 .
the massed ranks of liverpool supporters , who sat in dispair during the interval , were now in ecstasy and were faced with a victory that seemed impossible just 15 minutes earlier .
it was almost inevitable that liverpool would tire , and traoré had to clear off the line from shevchenko before jamie carragher 's last-ditch tackled foiled kaká .
milan dominated in extra-time , and they were denied by a miracle double save by jerzy dudek from shevchenko in the final minutes .
so the match dramatically went to penalties .
brazilian serginho and andrea pirlo missed milan 's first two penalties .
didi hamann and djibril cisse were on target for liverpool .
subsitute jon dahl tomasson put milan in contention before john arne riise missed for liverpool .
kaka scored for milan , and after smicer scored for liverpool andrej shevchenko 's kick was saved by jerzy dudek to spark wild scenes of celebration .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .
recent attacks by müntefering on supposedly unbridled capitalist principles could return in campaign rhetoric . that could placate several high-profile spd left-wingers , who , for the moment , appear prepared to stay in the party and fight for it to turn away from schröder 's reform course . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

at stake : the german cup . there is really little love lost between these two teams . their managers use the nation 's biggest tabloid to bicker and complain about one another and the coaches are n't immune to a little one-upmanship either . but bayern and schalke 04 probably see it as their right to act like big shots . with their large fan base and massive budgets that helped them to a one-two finish this season , they certainly are the biggest thing in the bundesliga at the moment . on saturday , the two will end a season of tough bundesliga competition by fighting for the german cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
organizers are expecting a capacity crowd at the refurbished stadium , which now holds up to 75,000 people .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath lead his team to the title in his first year as coach " schalke ca n't always get so lucky , " he said .

rangnick thanked hoeness for the words of motivation , adding that he did n't really need to add much in order to fire up his players .
" according to bayern , we should n't even bother showing up , " rangnick said .
" but they were just as optimistic before our games in the bundesliga . " arriving in style both sides finished the season on a high note .
bayern mopped up struggling vfb stuttgart , which was fighting for third place , by a score of 3-1 .
striker and dutch international roy makaay has shown recently that he is top form adding a few goals and assists in the final weeks to give him the overall scorer 's title .
michael ballack continues the strong form he has displayed all season and his midfielding partner sebastian deisler has ended a season in which he suffered from psychological problems on a high note , scoring some nifty goals in the final games . schalke , too , has much to be pleased about .
after losing steam in the race to unseat bayern as champion 's , the blue-collar team from the former mining town of gelsenkirchen was in danger of giving up second place and its spot in the champion 's league tournament .
but schalke slipped by bottom-feeders sc freiburg on a goal by marcelo bordon -lrb- photo -rrb- in the 89th minute , to win 3-2 and secure second place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's marcelo jose bordon celebrates after scoring the winning goal . the " royal blues " expect to elevate their game , as they always seem to do , against their favorite nemesis .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 early elections may help german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new government will have to make job creation its top priority the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .
the years of 3 percent growth were gone and in the future germany would be lucky to expand at a rate of 1.5 percent , he said .
at best , all politicians in berlin can hope to do is to limit the damage . michael knigge -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd predicts slower growth for germany the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits .

schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.05.2005 early elections may help german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any new government will have to make job creation its top priority the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .
the years of 3 percent growth were gone and in the future germany would be lucky to expand at a rate of 1.5 percent , he said .
at best , all politicians in berlin can hope to do is to limit the damage . michael knigge -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd predicts slower growth for germany the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .

each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .
when the wto members in cancun failed to reach an agreement , lamy was highly critical .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .

" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .

many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .
though he was instrumental in brokering last summer 's reform of eu farm subsidies , lamy has also spearheaded european resistance to such change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters display two mock playing cards during a rally friday , april 15 , 2005 in manila , philippines , opposing the forthcoming world trade organizations conferences .
many wto members , particularly developing nations , are counting on the frenchman 's qualities as a facilitator and as being just the right person to talk rich nations into opening up their markets for imports from poorer countries .
" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .
that conference is due to approve a draft deal on lowering trade barriers . bildunterschrift : also looming large is how to handle the growing trade power of china , displayed most recently in its surging clothes and textile exports , which are threatening to unleash a wave of protectionist measures in rival countries , both rich and poor . he must also handle mounting tensions between the european union and the united states , the world 's two economic superpowers , over subsidies to their main plane makers , which could trigger the biggest trade row ever .

" schröder , -lrb- president horst -rrb- köhler and merkel have one thing in common - they are all protestant .
-lrb- the convention -rrb- gives them a platform to discuss the best way forward for our country . " at the opening ceremony , köhler said the event could help germans gather strength for the social changes headed their way , while convention president eckardt nagel proposed the event " take a stand against society 's current depression and pessimism . " born again ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protestant kirchentag takes place in hanover from may 25 - may 29 , 2005 .
it 's theme is " when your child , asks , in time to come ... " .
one of the most striking aspects of this year 's gathering is the large number of young participants .
they said they 're here to meet people and enjoy the convention 's various side events . the increased presence of the younger generation at this year 's protestant convention could be part of a wider trend .
recently , the church has observed an upsurge in religious fervor across society , most notably in the eastern states , where religion took a back seat during communist times . " we 've noticed that a certain religious inclination is finding far greater expression these days than in previous years , " said heike krohn from the berlin and brandenburg lutheran church in an interview with the berliner morgenpost daily . " there 's been a conspicuous rise in interest , " she said , pointing out that the church has been welcoming a surprising number of new members . what christianity really means but even more people are leaving it .
in 2003 , some 1,424 people joined the church , compared to 11,232 who turned their back on it .
even so , the situation 's not as bad as it looks .
11 years previously , 43,508 people became lapsed christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church is witnessing a similar trend .
in the years following the fall of the berlin wall , it saw the number of church-leavers fall from 14,500 in 1990 to 3000 in 2002 . " a lot of religious communities are asking themselves what christianity really means , " stefan förner , spokesman with the berlin archbishopric , told the morgenpost .
one factor , he said , is the recent appointment of pope benedict xvi .
" there was a rise of re-entries and conversions in the period just before and after his election . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for sale : holy space , cheap as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- back to belief in german schools last week 's emotional outpouring following the pope 's death has sparked excited calls from the faithful that christianity is back ' in ' .
a trend towards christian schooling in germany might just substantiate that belief .

but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years . many economists agree that no matter which political party forms the next government in berlin after a vote likely to come this september , it can help the troubled german economy - europe 's largest - get back on track . " it can really only get better , " said christian jasperneite , an economist at bankhaus m.m. warburg .
" the agony that hangs over everything at the moment has to be finally surmounted . " the economic reforms introduced by german chancellor gerhard schröder remain controversial and their impact uncertain .
his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of welfare cuts and labor market changes , is not completely accepted by either the german public or even schröder 's own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and the economic policies of conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their leader angela merkel are far from fully developed .
many experts hope the early election , which schröder proposed after the spd suffered a stunning defeat in the state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , will force the country 's politicians to state clearly how they hope to tackle germany 's high unemployment and slow growth . " what 's necessary is a coherent concept that diagnoses what 's wrong and comes up with a remedy and then communicates that to the public before implementing it , " jasperneite said . pressure for results at the moment , the christian democrats have the best chance of forming a coalition with the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , according to stefan schneider , the head of the macro trends department for deutsche bank research .
such a constellation would eliminate the current political gridlock between the lower and upper houses of parliament . " a chancellor angela merkel would really need to take advantage of that sort of dream situation right from the start by pushing through economic reforms , " schneider said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said a victory for the conservatives would give them immense political capital , but the pressure for results would be equally large .
a cdu-led government could count on the support of business leaders , however , an ugly clash with the trade unions could become inevitable .
still , schneider said the depth of germany 's economy problems meant the time for cautious had passed . " if she just follows the schröder plan of just trying to tweak things instead of going for radical change she wo n't be re-elected in four years , " he said . plenty of problems the list of problem areas plaguing germany is long .
the labor market , fiscal policy , funding the welfare system , immigration policy all need to be overhauled , according to the experts .
but even if a new government begins to quickly implement reforms right after the election , result can first be expected in three or four years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens plant in poland and regardless of whether schröder stays in office or merkel replaces him as chancellor , germany will still have to contend with the growing challenges of globalization of the economy .
though a more business-friendly government might help improve the investment climate somewhat , companies will still be under pressure to move jobs away from high-wage germany to low-cost nations in eastern europe and asia . other problems will also conspire to hamper german growth , according to economist jasperneite .
even if germany 's export-led economy begins to boom , domestically the country 's ageing population will lower the growth rate .
the years of 3 percent growth were gone and in the future germany would be lucky to expand at a rate of 1.5 percent , he said .
at best , all politicians in berlin can hope to do is to limit the damage . michael knigge -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oecd predicts slower growth for germany the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .
everything would be decided over 90 minutes .
-lrb- may 22 , 2005 -rrb- scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

but is there enough room for them ?

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.05.2005 those special bundesliga moments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga celebrated record attendance this year the 42nd bundesliga season has come to an end , and fans have had time to process the sight of bayern munich hoisting the winner 's trophy yet again .
but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .
the revelation that referee robert hoyzer manipulated games for his own financial game was the league 's biggest scandal since 1971 , when bribery was rife in germany 's top league . hoyzer admitted to cooperating with the croatian mafia and intentionally manipulated at least one match , earning more than 67,000 euros -lrb- $ 83,800 -rrb- .
the news , and subsequent cases of manipulation in germany 's lower leagues , threatened to ruin the country 's reputation one year before it hosts the world cup . maybe that 's why the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- was quick to sweep it under the rug at their meeting in april . they did take some measures : those involved were banned for life and the dfb passed a rule forbidding players , referees , coaches and federation functionaries from betting on games .
german fans seemed as convinced the scandal was a freak exception , rather than the rule , in their country .
attendance at bundesliga games reached 11.5 million , breaking all records . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga ends in agony and ecstasy there was still lots to play for on the final day of the bundesliga on saturday .
there were two champions league slots and three uefa cup berths up for grabs .

but there were a few surprises .
dw-world 's top five moments . the phantom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top scorer mintal .
most likely to be wearing a different jersey next year he 's 27 , but looks like he just finished school .
if his sprightly frame and bulbous nose do n't fit the profile of a dominant , goal-scoring threat , his numbers certainly do .
in a league where plenty of goals are scored , but only rarely by strikers , marek mintal of 1 .
fc nuremberg notched 24 of them to win the league scoring title . mintal , a pure striker , can hammer it home from outside the box , but seems to prefer hovering out of sight and slashing one in when no one expects it .
the talent has earned him the nickname the phantom .
now he 's invisible no longer .
although his club , which owes him everlasting gratitude for keeping them in the first league , would like to keep him , mintal looks set to transfer to a better team with more money . europe 's whipping boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : look , but do n't touch .
the champion 's league trophy -lrb- l . -rrb- and the uefa cup were off-limits for german teams this year considering it 's europe 's biggest economy , and one of the european union 's most powerful players , germany has some surprising difficulty throwing its weight around in the continent 's major tournaments . granted , werder bremen , fc bayern munich and bayer leverkusen all made it past the group stage into the round of 16 in this year 's champion 's league tournament , which ended with liverpool winning on wednesday .
but all but munich were quickly dispatched before things got serious in the quarterfinals .
the teams competing in the uefa cup , the continent 's less prestigious tournament , fared worse .
schalke 04 , vfb stuttgart and allemania aachen did n't make it past the round of 32 .
schalke , which has been trying to rebuild itself as a serious german title contender and major player on the european scene , lost to a team called shakhtar donetsk , from a coal mining town in ukraine . the same cast of characters will head to europe next season , with the exception of hertha bsc , which replaces aachen in the uefa cup , and schalke 04 switching tournaments with leverkusen to compete in the champion 's league .
germany 's top coaches tend to get defensive when talking about the bundesliga 's european weakness . " three german teams survived tough opponents to get past the group stage in the champion 's league , " said bremen 's thomas schaaf .
his team was one of them , and then proceeded to get hammered by olympique lyon by an aggregate score of 10-2 , something schaaf could n't keep from mentioning : " they really wiped the floor with us . " half-court shot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho , celebrating one of his 18 goals this season ; each as different as his hair color .
a mastermind in the midfield whose performance determines what type of day his club will have , hertha bsc 's brazlian enigma marcelinho outed himself as a prolific goal scorer as well this season . his 18 goals were enough to earn him fourth place in the goal-scoring list , and his 13 assists put his combined numbers just behind bayern 's roy makaay .
but there is one category marcelinho can likely claim all on his own : the most amazing goal . as his team floundered in the first half of a match against relegation candidate sc freiburg in april , marcelinho gathered the ball in midfield , juked one player , and noticed goalie richard golz standing a little too far away from his line .
with an arrogance that only the most creative players possess , marcelinho rocketed a shot from 48 meters out -lrb- roughly midfield -rrb- , over the outstretched fingertips of a backpedaling golz and into the back of the net .
the goal sent his team on its way to a 3-1 victory , and a secure spot in the uefa cup next season . harry potter and his boys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp -lrb- r . -rrb- , as energetic as his young players .
after two heartbreaking seasons in the second league where their exclusion from the bundesliga was decided in the final minutes of the final matches , mainz 05 finally made it to the top league this season .
experts expected them to head right back down again .
but then mainz 05 began winning , setting up a little streak at the beginning of the bundesliga season that briefly put them ahead of bayern munich in the standings and confounded the country 's soccer minds . the secret ?
a little dash of globalization .
coach jürgen klopp borrowed his team 's attacking style of play from the english leagues to make up for the talent gap between his players and the league 's richer teams .
he drew inspiration for his pre-game and halftime speeches from new zealand 's rugby team , the all blacks . klopp 's boys responded , tearing out of the gates , fading after the winter break and turning it on again in the final months of the season to trump all expectations and remain in the bundesliga .
the team , known as the carnival club because mainz remains the traditional home of the yearly celebration , partied like champions on the final day of the season .
klopp , who looks like an older harry potter , told reporters that was because that 's exactly what mainz 05 felt like . scandal numb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the culprit : fallen ref robert hoyzer in a season of colorful stories and impressive individual feats , a dark cloud hovered over the bundesliga during the winter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide expected french ' non ' hits euro courting the constitution europe -pipe- 26.05.2005 europe can weather constitution refusal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oui or non , the french vote will determine the eu 's next steps politicians have warned the french that voting down the eu constitution would push the eu into a period of introspection and even lead to the collapse of the union .
other observers say it 's not as bad as all that . whether reading newspapers , watching tv , or even just sitting in a café , it 's been impossible to get away from the constitutional debate for weeks - and rightly so , both sides agree .
this sunday 's decision will play a fundamental role in the future face of the european union .
" we will go through a great period of crisis , " said former european commission president romano prodi of a french constitutional rejection .
" the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . "
but most experts agree the actual likelihood of complete collapse is slim .
should the french vote against the draft , as current polls show 54 percent of them will , the decision could finish off european constitution efforts , but the union would continue its other work using the current framework .
" yes or no , the eu will continue with its current structures , " said olaf hahn of the robert bosch foundation .
" but it will have to decide the basic question of how it will continue . "
bildunterschrift : however , if the " no " camp succeeds " france will find itself on the platform while the train passes us by , " french president jacques chirac said , and observers agree that the rest of the eu would also be left waiting on the platform while europe searches for its center .
eu business put on hold a long period of introspection would have significant repercussions as the 25-member bloc struggles with finalizing its 2007-2013 long-term budget , attempts to convince iran not to pursue uranium enrichment and approaches turkish accession talks scheduled to begin in october .
voting down the constitution in france could also signal a change from the principle of a franco-german core , according to martin koopmann of the german council on foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regardless of sunday 's outcome , work in the eu will proceed " it would be the first time that france blocks european integration , " he said .
" the eu is based on the logic that germany and france push forward together , and that logic would be reversed . "
a european phase of self-absorption stemming from the world ’ s fourth-largest economy 's " n on " to the constitution and the looming german federal elections would be more than sufficient to convince companies to put off new european investments and put a dent in the euro , which is already approaching a seven-month low against the dollar .

the dollar stood at 108.00 yen , from 107.70 on tuesday . though the comments ascribed to him have been denied , the times newspaper 's suggestion that sarkozy told french ministers that the vote was lost pushed the euro down to its lowest level since october . " given the close proximity of the vote , the increasing concerns of the fallout in europe in the event of a " no " and the lack of other market moving developments , french referendum speculation is exerting greater influence on euro movements , " said mark austin , global head of currency strategy at hsbc . the " yes " campaign was due later thursday to seek to regain the initiative , with french president jacques chirac using a television appearance to convince voters to support the constitution . but most analysts think it will be too little too late . " limited fallout " despite the near-term impact of the expected " no " vote , hsbc 's austin said the market reaction had been " overstated . "
he added that the market should be " fairly well-braced " for a " no " vote , suggesting a " limited fallout " when trading resumes on monday . the euro has been under pressure in recent weeks by fears the french will vote against the eu constitution this weekend as well as concerns about the state of the euro-zone economy . investors have placed greater importance on developments related to interest rate differentials than structural concerns relating to the united states ' twin deficits .
economic concerns surrounding the euro zone mounted on wednesday after another disappointing economic survey from germany , the zone 's largest economy . german business confidence slumped to the lowest level in 21 months in may , quashing hopes for a pick-up in economic activity in the country in the foreseeable future . despite the grim economic picture in the 12-nation currency zone , analysts did not expect an imminent interest rate cut from the european central bank .

at stake : the german cup . there is really little love lost between these two teams . their managers use the nation 's biggest tabloid to bicker and complain about one another and the coaches are n't immune to a little one-upmanship either . but bayern and schalke 04 probably see it as their right to act like big shots . with their large fan base and massive budgets that helped them to a one-two finish this season , they certainly are the biggest thing in the bundesliga at the moment . on saturday , the two will end a season of tough bundesliga competition by fighting for the german cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium .
organizers are expecting a capacity crowd at the refurbished stadium , which now holds up to 75,000 people .

" still , i 'm sure that we 're motivated enough to win the final , " he added , at the joint press conference between the two this week . motivational bickering the two were a bit punchier earlier this week , giving the media plenty to print in the run-up to the final .
magath -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose team lost both matches with schalke this season , said his team was better .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath lead his team to the title in his first year as coach " schalke ca n't always get so lucky , " he said .

rangnick thanked hoeness for the words of motivation , adding that he did n't really need to add much in order to fire up his players .
" according to bayern , we should n't even bother showing up , " rangnick said .
" but they were just as optimistic before our games in the bundesliga . " arriving in style both sides finished the season on a high note .
bayern mopped up struggling vfb stuttgart , which was fighting for third place , by a score of 3-1 .

the 58-year-old frenchman has some tough challenges ahead of him . wto members officially named lamy as the organization 's new leader at their meeting on thursday .
the former european union trade commissioner beat three other rivals for this coveted post .
wto members nominated lamy after uraguayan diplomat , carlos perez del castillo , dropped out . the chairman of the general council , kenyan ambassador amina mohamed , said the process leading to lamy 's nomination went smoothly .
" i think that we have proved that the organization works , that the members take their commitments and their responsibilities seriously and they have come through on a very serious issue , selecting a director general for the organization , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- general director supachai panitchpakdi , right , from thailand in 1999 the wto was unable to agree upon a candidate for its director general .

each man was given a three-year term .
this time around , wto delegates were able to avoid a similar confrontation .
while serving as the european union 's trade commissioner , pascal lamy often gave the impression that he would like the eu to do more to cut back its multi-billion-euro subsidies for agriculture .
however , politics in brussels apparently got in the way . " medieval " organization now he says that concluding the stalled global trade talks known as the doha round is his highest priority .
the talks have been held up largely by bickering over the highly protected agricultural markets in the us and europe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " this organization is medieval .
the procedures , the rules of this organization can not support the weight of its task , " he said at the time .
" there 's no reliable way to steer discussions among 148 members in a manner conducive to consensus , which remains the rule of this organization . "
educated at france 's elite universities lamy has been a close ally of jacques delors , the former chief commissioner of the european union .
lamy has a reputation of being extremely ambitious .
when he resigned from his job as the eu 's trade commissioner in 2004 he made it clear that he thought he deserved an even more prestigious post . despite his image as being a european technocrat and career diplomat , lamy likes to surprise .
in cancun he discussed trade issues with ngos for hours wearing blue jeans and a plain shirt .
at a wto summit in qatar he paid a visit to the " rainbow warrior , " the trademark of greenpeace . at times , he must have regretted saying his medieval remark about the organization and addressed it obliquely when journalists asked him why he wanted the job as head of the wto so badly .
" i mean , if you need evidence that i was not thinking about pitching for this job , you have one , " he said . attention to developing world as the head of the wto lamy will have to show that he no longer represents only europe or the industrialized nations .

" what i believe the wto can do is make trade work more for development , " he said .
" build rules and implement them in a way which makes the developing countries feel that they are beneficiaries and not victims of the system .
this is , i think , the crucial issue . "
now he faces the daunting task of wrapping up the doha round of free trade talks by the end of 2006 .
his first task will be to prepare for the next ministerial conference in hong kong in december .

having flirted with the idea of leaving the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and he clearly felt the time was right after the chancellor decided to bring forward the next general election for this fall . lafontaine has consistently attacked schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 , a package of unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv that slashed unemployment benefits . " i have always said that if my party went into the election with agenda 2010 and hartz iv , i could n't support it anymore , " lafontaine said on german television .
" the decision has now been made . " after abandoning the spd , lafontaine immediate went about trying to forge a new political home for himself .
he has proposed an alliance between the eastern german party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and a new western left-wing party calling itself election alternative -lrb- wasg -rrb- . trailing the conservatives already trailing the conservative opposition , a new threat from the left could seriously jeopardize schröder 's re-election chances this autumn as it could siphon off support from disgruntled trade unionists and left-wing hardliners in the spd .
after 39 years as a social democrat , the charismatic lafontaine could possibly draw many people to the banner of any new party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " such an alliance would be a clear challenge and one that i do n't underestimate , " said spd chairman franz müntefering . the spd is still reeling from the crushing defeat in last sunday ’ s election in the state of north rhine-westphalia , once a regional stronghold for the social democrats .
schröder felt he had no choice but to bring the general election scheduled for autumn 2006 forward by a year after the conservatives won the poll . professor jürgen falter , a political scientist at the university of mainz , said a potential left-wing coalition could try to combine lafontaine 's popularity with that of the pds ' former leader gregor gysi to build a pan-german far-left party . " with people like oskar lafontaine and perhaps gregor gysi as the respective candidates for western and eastern germany , the party will very likely get past the five percent parliamentary hurdle , " falter told dw-radio . pds unsure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky the leadership of the pds , which rose from the ashes of east germany 's former communist party , is uncertain there is enough time to try to merge the two parties .
however , pds chairman lothar bisky on wednesday said he still thought a united leftist party would was a good idea .
" it would possibly provide a great lift for the left overall , " said in an interview with wdr television . regardless of how successful the hard left is at combining their election efforts , it could force the spd to swing away from the political center .
recent attacks by müntefering on supposedly unbridled capitalist principles could return in campaign rhetoric . that could placate several high-profile spd left-wingers , who , for the moment , appear prepared to stay in the party and fight for it to turn away from schröder 's reform course . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

they can now keep the european cup after winning it for the fifth time the 2005 champions league final in istanbul will go down as one of the most dramatic ever .
liverpool , four time winners of the european cup , found themselves 3-0 down at half-time after goals by paolo maldini and two by hernan crespo had put a vastly superior milan side in total control .
maldini's goal was the fastest ever in a champions league final .
it looked all over for the reds but liverpool coach rafa benitez must have found some magic words to say in the changing room .
his team came out and launched as sensational comeback .

minutes later vladimir smicer's shot evaded milan keeper dida to make it 2-3 .
liverpool were hardly recognizable now and when steve gerrard was brought down by gennaro gattuso the reds were poised to equalize .
xabi alonso stepped up to take the penalty but dida saved .

munich-based ifo 's confidence index fell from 93.3 in april to 92.9 in may , its fourth straight month of decline .
the news follows similarly weak german data from economic think tank zew and the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
chancellor gerhard schroeder is facing increasing economic pressure ahead of a vote of confidence on 1 july .
if he loses the parliamentary vote , as is widely expected , it could lead to an early general election .
joblessness voters punished mr schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at the polls in the key state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , amid disillusion with painful economic and welfare reforms that have so far failed to boost growth and curb mass unemployment .
ifo 's findings on the glum mood among german firms follows data on tuesday from zew indicating german investor confidence had fallen to a six-month low .
meanwhile , the oecd lowered its 2005 german growth forecast from 1.2 % to 1 % .
germany 's jobless total remains stubbornly close to the post war record of five million reached in march .
in ifo 's monthly survey , about 7,000 companies are asked for their views of the current business climate and their outlook over the coming six months .
companies were feeling slightly happier about current conditions , but gloomier about longer-term prospects , ifo president hans-werner sinn said .
" an improvement in the economic situation in the coming months is not to be expected , " he added .
the downturn surprised economists , who had predicted a modest improvement in the business outlook of german firms .

munich-based ifo 's confidence index fell from 93.3 in april to 92.9 in may , its fourth straight month of decline .
the news follows similarly weak german data from economic think tank zew and the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
chancellor gerhard schroeder is facing increasing economic pressure ahead of a vote of confidence on 1 july .
if he loses the parliamentary vote , as is widely expected , it could lead to an early general election .
joblessness voters punished mr schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- at the polls in the key state of north rhine-westphalia on sunday , amid disillusion with painful economic and welfare reforms that have so far failed to boost growth and curb mass unemployment .
ifo 's findings on the glum mood among german firms follows data on tuesday from zew indicating german investor confidence had fallen to a six-month low .
meanwhile , the oecd lowered its 2005 german growth forecast from 1.2 % to 1 % .
germany 's jobless total remains stubbornly close to the post war record of five million reached in march .
in ifo 's monthly survey , about 7,000 companies are asked for their views of the current business climate and their outlook over the coming six months .
companies were feeling slightly happier about current conditions , but gloomier about longer-term prospects , ifo president hans-werner sinn said .

si and cecilia - the richard and judy of shona podcasting a podcast is basically a radio show that can be downloaded over the internet and then listened to on a portable digital music player , such as an ipod or an mp3 player .
the british man behind the shona podcast , si brindley , wanted to learn shona because his wife , cecilia , is zimbabwean and he wanted to understand more about her culture .
" i liked the idea of podcasting and i wanted to get into it .
but i did n't want to be just another person talking about nothing , " he told the bbc news website .
so he is the guinea-pig learning shona on behalf of anyone else who is interested .
free-for-all mr brindley says the show is not only the first podcast on shona but the first about zimbabwe .
however , they do not touch on politics because many of cecilia 's relatives are still in zimbabwe and they do not want to risk angering the authorities .
i 'm the technical geek and she was n't sure .
but just the other day , she was telling me how much she loves it now si brindley the great thing about podcasting is that , like the internet , it is open to anyone .
you do n't need anything more sophisticated than a microphone , a computer and an internet connection - no need for a licence - and you can become a podcaster , with people listening to your shows across the world .
but this can also be a downside - people with limited talent , experience or training rambling on primarily for their own self-interest .
the shona podcast is not professionally made but the unpolished sound is just what podcast fans are supposedly looking for .
and there are sound effects in addition to the speech .
mr brindley says he spends about three hours editing the show , which they try to produce every week or so .
frisson language teachers , however , will not be impressed at mr brindley 's slow progress .
in a 17-minute podcast , mr brindley only learns the numbers 1-10 and the days of the week .
si risked cecilia 's wrath by calling sadza ' cardboardy porridge ' in fact , he does his best to get out of actually learning shona .
" i 'm english , so i 'll say the english words .
you 're shona , so you do the shona , " he tells his unimpressed wife on the show .
when he does try and say some shona words , he says the most difficult thing is the pronunciation of sounds which do not exist in english .
but he says this is why it is difficult to learn shona from a book - you need to hear the spoken word to try and repeat it correctly .
mr brindley brushes off comparisons with the famous husband and wife double act on british television , richard and judy .
" maybe we 're the richard and judy of shona podcasting , " he says .
but there is a certain marital frisson when mr bindley risks his wife 's wrath by calling zimbabwe 's staple food sadza " cardboardy porridge " on one show .
still , he survived to tell the tale and she does actually admit that sadza , made from maize meal , does not have any taste .
feedback while mr brindley seems reluctant to learn shona , he is very keen on podcasting .
he says he sets his computer to automatically download his 12 favourite podcasts overnight and listens to them on his ipod in the car .
hopefully , there will be podcasts coming out of zimbabwe one day si brindley and he has managed to convince his wife , cecilia , of the benefits of podcasting .
" i 'm the technical geek and she was n't sure .
but just the other day , she was telling me how much she loves it now , " mr brindley says .
he says that he has been astonished at the amount of encouraging e-mails they have received .
" we might have given up , if it was not for the feedback , " he says .
and more people are signing up .
downloads have gradually increased from 30 to 160 by the fifth and most recent show , he says .
obviously , most have some interest in zimbabwe - zimbabweans or people who have been there - but some , he says , have just typed zimbabwe into a search engine and stumbled across the podcast .
" hopefully , there will be podcasts coming out of zimbabwe one day , " mr brindley says .
internet connections can be slow in zimbabwe but mr brindley says that does not make podcasting impossible , just much slower .
maybe some of those zimbabwean podcasts will touch on politics .
as with the internet , podcasting could prove to be an invaluable way for those people unhappy with the way zimbabwe is going to both let off steam and inform the rest of the world .

and more people are signing up .
downloads have gradually increased from 30 to 160 by the fifth and most recent show , he says .
obviously , most have some interest in zimbabwe - zimbabweans or people who have been there - but some , he says , have just typed zimbabwe into a search engine and stumbled across the podcast .
" hopefully , there will be podcasts coming out of zimbabwe one day , " mr brindley says .
internet connections can be slow in zimbabwe but mr brindley says that does not make podcasting impossible , just much slower .
maybe some of those zimbabwean podcasts will touch on politics .
as with the internet , podcasting could prove to be an invaluable way for those people unhappy with the way zimbabwe is going to both let off steam and inform the rest of the world .

si and cecilia - the richard and judy of shona podcasting a podcast is basically a radio show that can be downloaded over the internet and then listened to on a portable digital music player , such as an ipod or an mp3 player .
the british man behind the shona podcast , si brindley , wanted to learn shona because his wife , cecilia , is zimbabwean and he wanted to understand more about her culture .
" i liked the idea of podcasting and i wanted to get into it .
but i did n't want to be just another person talking about nothing , " he told the bbc news website .
so he is the guinea-pig learning shona on behalf of anyone else who is interested .
free-for-all mr brindley says the show is not only the first podcast on shona but the first about zimbabwe .
however , they do not touch on politics because many of cecilia 's relatives are still in zimbabwe and they do not want to risk angering the authorities .
i 'm the technical geek and she was n't sure .
but just the other day , she was telling me how much she loves it now si brindley the great thing about podcasting is that , like the internet , it is open to anyone .
you do n't need anything more sophisticated than a microphone , a computer and an internet connection - no need for a licence - and you can become a podcaster , with people listening to your shows across the world .
but this can also be a downside - people with limited talent , experience or training rambling on primarily for their own self-interest .
the shona podcast is not professionally made but the unpolished sound is just what podcast fans are supposedly looking for .
and there are sound effects in addition to the speech .
mr brindley says he spends about three hours editing the show , which they try to produce every week or so .
frisson language teachers , however , will not be impressed at mr brindley 's slow progress .
in a 17-minute podcast , mr brindley only learns the numbers 1-10 and the days of the week .
si risked cecilia 's wrath by calling sadza ' cardboardy porridge ' in fact , he does his best to get out of actually learning shona .
" i 'm english , so i 'll say the english words .
you 're shona , so you do the shona , " he tells his unimpressed wife on the show .
when he does try and say some shona words , he says the most difficult thing is the pronunciation of sounds which do not exist in english .
but he says this is why it is difficult to learn shona from a book - you need to hear the spoken word to try and repeat it correctly .
mr brindley brushes off comparisons with the famous husband and wife double act on british television , richard and judy .
" maybe we 're the richard and judy of shona podcasting , " he says .
but there is a certain marital frisson when mr bindley risks his wife 's wrath by calling zimbabwe 's staple food sadza " cardboardy porridge " on one show .
still , he survived to tell the tale and she does actually admit that sadza , made from maize meal , does not have any taste .
feedback while mr brindley seems reluctant to learn shona , he is very keen on podcasting .
he says he sets his computer to automatically download his 12 favourite podcasts overnight and listens to them on his ipod in the car .
hopefully , there will be podcasts coming out of zimbabwe one day si brindley and he has managed to convince his wife , cecilia , of the benefits of podcasting .

cathy dennis - who has just won an ivor novello award for britney spears ' toxic - has been making hit records since 1989 .
she started out as a singer with acid-house pioneers d-mob before launching a solo career .
in recent years , she 's concentrated on writing songs for other artists , and has sent spears and kylie minogue to the top of the charts .
dennis , who already had four ivor novello songwriting awards , has written dozens of top 10 hits and worked with legends such as burt bacharach and ray davies .
but , she says the biggest thrill she gets is still from hearing one of her songs on the radio .
the music of cathy dennis listen to some of cathy dennis ' biggest hits - and read what she has to say about them .
audio gallery " it 's the highest of the highs .
knowing how many people are receiving it , you just get this huge injection of pride and excitement , " dennis says .
dennis worked with burt bacaharch on will young 's debut album fifteen years have passed since her first single , just another dream , was played on the airwaves .
back then , she was a solo artist promoting her debut album , move to this .
cathy moved to london to write the album in 1986 , but it took her three years to finish .
" i 'm not quite sure why , " she says , " maybe i was doing sight-seeing tours all the time . "
however , it was america that picked up on the album 's glossy post-house pop music first , and dennis soon found herself criss-crossing the states promoting singles like touch me -lrb- all night long -rrb- and too many walls .
having to smile on cue has never sat very comfortably with me cathy dennis " there was a lot of laughter on those trips .
we had a lot of fun and unfortunately you can never get that innocence back again , " she says .
" but there 's a lot of aspects of touring that i really do n't miss at all .
shaking hands with somebody and having to smile on cue has never sat very comfortably with me . "
rebel dennis has a polite and reserved exterior but it hides a rebellious nature .
" i do n't like to conform , " she says , " and i 'll cut my nose off to spite my face .
dennis calls ray davies a genius after working with him in 1996 " i 'll ask someone for their opinion and then go the other way for the sake of it .
it really annoys me and i do n't understand it , but it 's just me . "
dennis ' stubborn streak caused problems with her solo career .
" my third album was incredibly self-indulgent but i did n't want to commercialise what i was doing , " she says .
i like to write from a melodic point of view cathy dennis the album am i the kinda girl features some collaborations with ray davies and guy chambers , but it stalled at number 78 in the uk charts .
" i got really frustrated , " she recalls , " i started to dig myself into a burrow . "
melody cool first and foremost a songwriter - she had a writing contract with emi before she was signed as a solo artist - dennis settled into writing songs for other artists from janet jackson to celine dion and will young .
britney spears ' toxic was a massive hit for dennis " i like to write from a melodic point-of-view , " she says .
most of her songs are co-written , with dennis adding vocal lines and lyrics to a pre-recorded backing track .
she says her talent stems from a musical upbringing .
both of her parents are musicians , but they did n't force her to learn music in the traditional way .
" i was n't allowed to do theory or go and have lessons like my dad , but it became a very normal thing to listen to the top 40 on a sunday night .
" i could n't relate to the nursery rhymes and boring songs that i was being told to listen to in music class at school .
when you 're used to listening to pop songs , it 's a completely different world . "
the impression you get is that , even while growing up in norwich , in the east of england , dennis knew her destiny would be in pop music .
that grounding gives her a great deal of confidence when she 's in the studio .
" if someone tries to dilute what i 'm doing ...
i generally tend to stick my neck out . "
dennis ' musical instincts were vindicated in 2001 when she scored her biggest hit to date .
ca n't get you out of my head helped kylie break america ca n't get you out of my head went straight to number one , reinvigorated kylie minogue 's career , and bagged its writers an unprecedented three ivor novello awards .
" it was n't conforming to pop , " dennis says , " you think about pop music and you do n't think of those kind of notes .
it was darker .
" and it led me to a new-found freedom melodically in what i felt was acceptable for me to do . "

but , she says the biggest thrill she gets is still from hearing one of her songs on the radio .
the music of cathy dennis listen to some of cathy dennis ' biggest hits - and read what she has to say about them .
audio gallery " it 's the highest of the highs .
knowing how many people are receiving it , you just get this huge injection of pride and excitement , " dennis says .
dennis worked with burt bacaharch on will young 's debut album fifteen years have passed since her first single , just another dream , was played on the airwaves .
back then , she was a solo artist promoting her debut album , move to this .
cathy moved to london to write the album in 1986 , but it took her three years to finish .
" i 'm not quite sure why , " she says , " maybe i was doing sight-seeing tours all the time . "
however , it was america that picked up on the album 's glossy post-house pop music first , and dennis soon found herself criss-crossing the states promoting singles like touch me -lrb- all night long -rrb- and too many walls .
having to smile on cue has never sat very comfortably with me cathy dennis " there was a lot of laughter on those trips .
we had a lot of fun and unfortunately you can never get that innocence back again , " she says .
" but there 's a lot of aspects of touring that i really do n't miss at all .
shaking hands with somebody and having to smile on cue has never sat very comfortably with me . "
rebel dennis has a polite and reserved exterior but it hides a rebellious nature .
" i do n't like to conform , " she says , " and i 'll cut my nose off to spite my face .
dennis calls ray davies a genius after working with him in 1996 " i 'll ask someone for their opinion and then go the other way for the sake of it .
it really annoys me and i do n't understand it , but it 's just me . "
dennis ' stubborn streak caused problems with her solo career .
" my third album was incredibly self-indulgent but i did n't want to commercialise what i was doing , " she says .
i like to write from a melodic point of view cathy dennis the album am i the kinda girl features some collaborations with ray davies and guy chambers , but it stalled at number 78 in the uk charts .
" i got really frustrated , " she recalls , " i started to dig myself into a burrow . "
melody cool first and foremost a songwriter - she had a writing contract with emi before she was signed as a solo artist - dennis settled into writing songs for other artists from janet jackson to celine dion and will young .
britney spears ' toxic was a massive hit for dennis " i like to write from a melodic point-of-view , " she says .
most of her songs are co-written , with dennis adding vocal lines and lyrics to a pre-recorded backing track .
she says her talent stems from a musical upbringing .
both of her parents are musicians , but they did n't force her to learn music in the traditional way .
" i was n't allowed to do theory or go and have lessons like my dad , but it became a very normal thing to listen to the top 40 on a sunday night .
" i could n't relate to the nursery rhymes and boring songs that i was being told to listen to in music class at school .
when you 're used to listening to pop songs , it 's a completely different world . "
the impression you get is that , even while growing up in norwich , in the east of england , dennis knew her destiny would be in pop music .
that grounding gives her a great deal of confidence when she 's in the studio .
" if someone tries to dilute what i 'm doing ...
i generally tend to stick my neck out . "
dennis ' musical instincts were vindicated in 2001 when she scored her biggest hit to date .
ca n't get you out of my head helped kylie break america ca n't get you out of my head went straight to number one , reinvigorated kylie minogue 's career , and bagged its writers an unprecedented three ivor novello awards .
" it was n't conforming to pop , " dennis says , " you think about pop music and you do n't think of those kind of notes .
it was darker .
" and it led me to a new-found freedom melodically in what i felt was acceptable for me to do . "

thames valley police says it is to use " a considerable number of officers " to prevent the events before they begin .
they hope to stop the large numbers of vehicles that come in to the area 's villages as a result of the events .
the decision to step up action comes after a large rave was held on the ridgeway near east hendred on the bank holiday at the start of may .
more than 90 vehicles with three large sound systems were also stopped from entering land near aldworth on 15 may after a tip off from an off-duty officer who overheard plans for a rave .
ch insp david purnell said : " we will investigate and assess all illegal raves in accordance with the criminal justice and public order act .
" i have allocated a considerable number of officers to resource this operation as these raves are unlicensed and frequently involve large numbers of people disrupting the lives of others . "

officers say a peregrine falcon and two buzzards were killed in two separate incidents close to geltsdale reserve , near penrith .
tests by the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- revealed all had been poisoned by the banned agricultural pesticide carbofuran .
animal welfare officers have condemned the incidents .
a spokesman for cumbria police said staff at the rspb geltsdale reserve found a dead peregrine falcon on crookburn pike on 30 march .
tests showed the bird had been poisoned by carbofuran .
' illegal and indiscriminate ' he said the bird was protected under the wildlife and countryside act 1981 and intentional killing carried a maximum fine of £ 5,000 or six months imprisonment .
" tragically , this has been followed by a second incident less than four miles away , when officers picked up two dead buzzards adjacent to a cut open rabbit on cumrew fell near newbiggin , penrith .
" analysis on one buzzard and the bait has again confirmed the presence of carbofuran .
" the placing of poison in the open countryside is illegal and indiscriminate and creates a risk to both wildlife and people , " he said .
andy bunten , rspb regional director , added : " it is disgraceful we are finding illegally killed birds on and close to a nature reserve .
" unfortunately , there has been a history of similar incidents with illegally shot and poisoned birds being found on the edge of the reserve .
" there appears to be a determined campaign to try and eradicate these birds . "

called spore , the game allows players to determine the evolution of a species , from an amoeba to an inter-stellar race .
sims creator will wright offered an insight into the game at last week 's e3 expo in los angeles .
the pc game is due to be in stores by autumn of 2006 .
reality simulated will wright made his name in the games industry with the computer simulation game simcity .
when it launched in 1989 , simcity became a huge hit with players who wanted to do more with their games . "
you end up playing a galaxy of 100,000s of worlds .
and because players are creating the worlds , everything will be different " will wright mr wright went on to create the sims in 2000 , which let players run the lives of virtual people .
it quickly became the best-selling pc game of all time and opened up a different understanding of what a game was and how real life itself was much like a game .
with spore , mr wright is taking this idea one step further , by developing a title based on the evolution of life .
" i want to allow people to create their own world , " he said during a demonstration of the game , spore , at the e3 games expo .
generation game in the game , players start off as an amoeba in a 2d world , reminiscent of some early video games .
the aim is to grow and evolve generations of creatures , with players able to choose the physical attributes of their creation .
" you get to play every generation of the creature , " said mr wright .
" i want something boys can make scary things or casual gamers can make cute things . "
he said the computer would analyse a creature 's design and work out how it should behave .
in the demonstration , mr wright created a three-legged creature and said the software would work out how it should walk .
" this is the hardest piece of technology i have ever had to solve , " he said .
galactic play spore comes across as a mix of the sims and games like civilisation , where players determine the progress of a race .
the imagination of players is integral to the game .
it is not set up as a traditional multiplayer title , in which gamers play against each other .
instead the aim is to use a central computer to gather players ' creations and share them with everyone playing the game .
" you end up playing a galaxy of 100,000s of worlds .
and because players are creating the worlds , everything will be different , " said mr wright in the demo , he showed how a gamer would end up travelling through space , exploring the universe in search for intelligent life .
" i can play star trek and build a federation of planets or i can play 2001 and drop a obelisk to collect information , " said mr wright .
spore comes across as an ambitious title .
it is still in the early stages of development , so it is impossible to say whether it will live up to its promise .
fans will have to wait until the autumn of next year to get their hands on the pc game .

reality simulated will wright made his name in the games industry with the computer simulation game simcity .
when it launched in 1989 , simcity became a huge hit with players who wanted to do more with their games .
you end up playing a galaxy of 100,000s of worlds .
and because players are creating the worlds , everything will be different will wright mr wright went on to create the sims in 2000 , which let players run the lives of virtual people .
it quickly became the best-selling pc game of all time and opened up a different understanding of what a game was and how real life itself was much like a game .
with spore , mr wright is taking this idea one step further , by developing a title based on the evolution of life .
" i want to allow people to create their own world , " he said during a demonstration of the game , spore , at the e3 games expo .
generation game in the game , players start off as an amoeba in a 2d world , reminiscent of some early video games .
the aim is to grow and evolve generations of creatures , with players able to choose the physical attributes of their creation .
take your organism from an amoeba to an inter-stellar race " you get to play every generation of the creature , " said mr wright .
" i want something boys can make scary things or casual gamers can make cute things . "
he said the computer would analyse a creature 's design and work out how it should behave .
in the demonstration , mr wright created a three-legged creature and said the software would work out how it should walk .
" this is the hardest piece of technology i have ever had to solve , " he said .
galactic play spore comes across as a mix of the sims and games like civilisation , where players determine the progress of a race .
the imagination of players is integral to the game .
it is not set up as a traditional multiplayer title , in which gamers play against each other .
a far cry from simcity instead the aim is to use a central computer to gather players ' creations and share them with everyone playing the game .
" you end up playing a galaxy of 100,000s of worlds .
and because players are creating the worlds , everything will be different , " said mr wright in the demo , he showed how a gamer would end up travelling through space , exploring the universe in search for intelligent life .
" i can play star trek and build a federation of planets or i can play 2001 and drop a obelisk to collect information , " said mr wright .
spore comes across as an ambitious title .
it is still in the early stages of development , so it is impossible to say whether it will live up to its promise .
fans will have to wait until the autumn of next year to get their hands on the pc game .
