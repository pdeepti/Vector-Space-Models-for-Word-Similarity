the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .
according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .
" putting -lrb- these technologies -rrb- in luxury models is not my goal , " she said .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .

" our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .

" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .

" our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .

then , changing the tone with , " and now a personal word , " fischer dropped the politicial bomb on an unsuspecting room . " i want my freedom back , " fischer told the green bundestag parliamentary group in a dramatic tone behind closed doors .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .
scharioth called on the 191 un member states to support " an extensive cancellation of debts , including multilateral debts " at this weekend 's meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund . thomas nehls -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran makes nuke partnership offer at un iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad unveiled proposals , including an offer of foreign involvement in its uranium enrichment program , at the un on saturday in a bid to end the standoff over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .

then , changing the tone with , " and now a personal word , " fischer dropped the politicial bomb on an unsuspecting room . " i want my freedom back , " fischer told the green bundestag parliamentary group in a dramatic tone behind closed doors .
witnesses in the chamber reportered that top politicians in the green parliamentary group were brought to tears by fischer 's rousing speech . power exchanged for freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer tells reporters the news as the red-green chapter was now history , fischer said it was time for a new generation of green leaders to take the reigns .
after 20 years , he said he was ready to exchange power for freedom , an unforseen announcement from one who has the reputation of a power-hungry politician . fischer made clear that he would remain at the head of his party only under the most extreme circumstances .
as far as he was concerned , it did n't make any sense for the greens to be in any of the possible governing coalitions under discussion .
still , he said he would continue to take part in the negotiations , as long as it had to do with governing . following his announcement , the green mps celebrated fischer with a standing ovation lasting minutes .
the extraordinary orator is valued by his party as indispensible .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .

call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .
scharioth called on the 191 un member states to support " an extensive cancellation of debts , including multilateral debts " at this weekend 's meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund . thomas nehls -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran makes nuke partnership offer at un iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad unveiled proposals , including an offer of foreign involvement in its uranium enrichment program , at the un on saturday in a bid to end the standoff over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .
scharioth called on the 191 un member states to support " an extensive cancellation of debts , including multilateral debts " at this weekend 's meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund . thomas nehls -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran makes nuke partnership offer at un iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad unveiled proposals , including an offer of foreign involvement in its uranium enrichment program , at the un on saturday in a bid to end the standoff over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .

the team is now five points ahead of pursuer werder bremen , who lost 1-2 against borussia mönchengladbach . bayern munich 's victory over eintracht frankfurt tuesday evening extends their record run to 15 successive wins - six of them in the current season . " our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .
karimi played a helping hand in the goal , heading back mehmet scholl 's cross for guerrero to score . bremen suffers first defeat of the season up until now , werder bremen had kept up with bayern 's ferocious early pace .
but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .
polish striker ebi smolarek decided the game with his goal in the 83rd minute .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .
according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .
" putting -lrb- these technologies -rrb- in luxury models is not my goal , " she said .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .
" this discussion began even before the attacks of sept .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .
european police investigators routinely complain about a lack of cross-border communication needed to rooting out and arresting terrorist suspects .
the new information system by interpol should go some distance in solving the problem .

according to the un , the potential frozen assets could amount to $ 90 million worldwide . " as they are required by the security council ... these measures fall for the most part outside the scope of judicial review , " said the court in its decision .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .

" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .

it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2005 eu data-storage plan worries critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone calls , e-mails , text messages : its all fair game in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .
but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .
according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .

the team is now five points ahead of pursuer werder bremen , who lost 1-2 against borussia mönchengladbach . bayern munich 's victory over eintracht frankfurt tuesday evening extends their record run to 15 successive wins - six of them in the current season . " our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .
karimi played a helping hand in the goal , heading back mehmet scholl 's cross for guerrero to score . bremen suffers first defeat of the season up until now , werder bremen had kept up with bayern 's ferocious early pace .
but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .
polish striker ebi smolarek decided the game with his goal in the 83rd minute . " we could n't find any rhythm in the first half and were far too passive , " said arminia 's trainer thomas von heesen about the moderate match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's jiri stajner -lrb- left -rrb- tries to get the ball from wolfsburg 's alex the derby in lower saxony between hanover 96 and wolfsburg ended 2-4 , helping the " wolves " leave their local rival behind in the league ranking . wolfsburg 's mike hanke scored two goals in a row in the 10th and 15th minutes of the game .
diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro sealed hanover 's fate with their scores in the 27th and 33rd minutes . the two goals by hanover 's thomas brdaric in the 30th and 89th minutes could n't turn the game around . " we should n't even be playing in the bundesliga , the way we played in the first half , " said brdaric .

then , changing the tone with , " and now a personal word , " fischer dropped the politicial bomb on an unsuspecting room . " i want my freedom back , " fischer told the green bundestag parliamentary group in a dramatic tone behind closed doors .
witnesses in the chamber reportered that top politicians in the green parliamentary group were brought to tears by fischer 's rousing speech . power exchanged for freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer tells reporters the news as the red-green chapter was now history , fischer said it was time for a new generation of green leaders to take the reigns .
after 20 years , he said he was ready to exchange power for freedom , an unforseen announcement from one who has the reputation of a power-hungry politician . fischer made clear that he would remain at the head of his party only under the most extreme circumstances .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .
older visitors and city residents will continue complaining about the raucous music and disco atmosphere , while the younger ones chant " pump up the volume .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .

" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .

call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .
scharioth called on the 191 un member states to support " an extensive cancellation of debts , including multilateral debts " at this weekend 's meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund . thomas nehls -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran makes nuke partnership offer at un iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad unveiled proposals , including an offer of foreign involvement in its uranium enrichment program , at the un on saturday in a bid to end the standoff over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .

transparency difficult to achieve one possible solution would be an orientation toward concrete financial figures , but , according to holz , there are other performance yardsticks .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 21.09.2005 bayern munich keeps top bundesliga slot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's makaay -lrb- left -rrb- battles for control of the ball bayern munich maintained their 100 percent start to the season with a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt .
the team is now five points ahead of pursuer werder bremen , who lost 1-2 against borussia mönchengladbach . bayern munich 's victory over eintracht frankfurt tuesday evening extends their record run to 15 successive wins - six of them in the current season . " our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .
karimi played a helping hand in the goal , heading back mehmet scholl 's cross for guerrero to score . bremen suffers first defeat of the season up until now , werder bremen had kept up with bayern 's ferocious early pace .
but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .
polish striker ebi smolarek decided the game with his goal in the 83rd minute . " we could n't find any rhythm in the first half and were far too passive , " said arminia 's trainer thomas von heesen about the moderate match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's jiri stajner -lrb- left -rrb- tries to get the ball from wolfsburg 's alex the derby in lower saxony between hanover 96 and wolfsburg ended 2-4 , helping the " wolves " leave their local rival behind in the league ranking . wolfsburg 's mike hanke scored two goals in a row in the 10th and 15th minutes of the game .

" our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .

but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .

then , changing the tone with , " and now a personal word , " fischer dropped the politicial bomb on an unsuspecting room . " i want my freedom back , " fischer told the green bundestag parliamentary group in a dramatic tone behind closed doors .
witnesses in the chamber reportered that top politicians in the green parliamentary group were brought to tears by fischer 's rousing speech . power exchanged for freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer tells reporters the news as the red-green chapter was now history , fischer said it was time for a new generation of green leaders to take the reigns .
after 20 years , he said he was ready to exchange power for freedom , an unforseen announcement from one who has the reputation of a power-hungry politician . fischer made clear that he would remain at the head of his party only under the most extreme circumstances .
as far as he was concerned , it did n't make any sense for the greens to be in any of the possible governing coalitions under discussion .
still , he said he would continue to take part in the negotiations , as long as it had to do with governing . following his announcement , the green mps celebrated fischer with a standing ovation lasting minutes .
the extraordinary orator is valued by his party as indispensible .
many see fischer as part and parcel of the greens , and can not fathom the party without his leadership . avoiding the conduct of chancellor kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two symbols of the green party : joschka and sunflowers in stepping back from the top position in the party , fischer said he was avoiding the fashion in which former chancellor helmut kohl continued to lurk about his party , attempting to exert influence though his time had passed .
he would not " accompany the party silently from the back rows , " fischer said . though he will be relinquishing his post as foreign minister and symbolic leader of the greens , fischer does not plan to completely retire from politics quite yet .
the 57-year-old legend will continue to sit in the bundestag as a regular representative . the end of the fischer-era will be the opening of another for some other green politician , though which one it will be still remains open .
a scramble for the co-chief position of the bundestag parliamentary group has already begun , with consumer protection minister renate künast and environment minister jürgen trittin challenging the incumbent parliamentary group chiefs katrin göring-eckhardt and krista sager . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

19 , 2005 -rrb- should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press were divided on tuesday on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .
-lrb- april 26 , 2005 -rrb- germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .

" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .

call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 germany 's divided political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting behavior is never set in stone , but there are trends pessimists say the only thing uniting many german voters was apprehension about reform .
the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 germany 's divided political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting behavior is never set in stone , but there are trends pessimists say the only thing uniting many german voters was apprehension about reform .
the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

but their collective power at the ballot box was not enough to secure a majority .

both the spd and cdu stuck to their claim to the chancellory .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .

such pay levels touch a sore spot in germany . in germany , executive salaries are a touchy subject given the consistently high unemployment rate and high number of layoffs . still , lackluster economic performance does not necessarily affect the bottom line when it comes to management salaries .
top earner among germany 's 30 largest public companies in 2004 was deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , who took home 6.2 million euros -lrb- $ 7.58 million -rrb- , according to the german association for equity protection .
swiss-born ackermann came under heavy fire earlier this year for cutting or relocating around 6,400 jobs at a time when germany 's biggest bank was enjoying rising profits .

board members at sportswear maker adidas received the biggest pay rises , with salaries jumping by 89 percent to an average 1.8 million euros .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 eu wants smarter cars , safer roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ' smart car ' technology prevent accidents ?
the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .

the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .

the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .

such pay levels touch a sore spot in germany . in germany , executive salaries are a touchy subject given the consistently high unemployment rate and high number of layoffs . still , lackluster economic performance does not necessarily affect the bottom line when it comes to management salaries .
top earner among germany 's 30 largest public companies in 2004 was deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , who took home 6.2 million euros -lrb- $ 7.58 million -rrb- , according to the german association for equity protection .
swiss-born ackermann came under heavy fire earlier this year for cutting or relocating around 6,400 jobs at a time when germany 's biggest bank was enjoying rising profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo of daimlerchrysler ag juergen schrempp , set to leave the company by the end of 2005 .
in second place was the head of german-us automaker daimlerchrysler , jürgen schrempp , whose 2004 pay packet totaled 4.5 million euros .
board members at sportswear maker adidas received the biggest pay rises , with salaries jumping by 89 percent to an average 1.8 million euros .
thyssenkrupp executives received a 60 percent wage hike to an average 1.5 million euros .
among the lowest earners was germany 's flag carrier lufthansa whose executives took home an average 851,000 euros in 2004 .

" unfortunately , these positions are not very well defined or based on any hard facts and figures .
there is also no publication of the previous year ’ s figures which would make it easier to make a comparison . "
transparency difficult to achieve one possible solution would be an orientation toward concrete financial figures , but , according to holz , there are other performance yardsticks .
" for shareholders , figures based on soft factors instead of hard numbers are completely nebulous , " she said .
" managers of the german stock exchange , for example , can increase their salaries with analyses and social skills . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.09.2005 german execs criticized for salary jumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : year after year salaries keep rising , despite the stagnant economy board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .
such pay levels touch a sore spot in germany . in germany , executive salaries are a touchy subject given the consistently high unemployment rate and high number of layoffs . still , lackluster economic performance does not necessarily affect the bottom line when it comes to management salaries .
top earner among germany 's 30 largest public companies in 2004 was deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , who took home 6.2 million euros -lrb- $ 7.58 million -rrb- , according to the german association for equity protection .
swiss-born ackermann came under heavy fire earlier this year for cutting or relocating around 6,400 jobs at a time when germany 's biggest bank was enjoying rising profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo of daimlerchrysler ag juergen schrempp , set to leave the company by the end of 2005 .
in second place was the head of german-us automaker daimlerchrysler , jürgen schrempp , whose 2004 pay packet totaled 4.5 million euros .
board members at sportswear maker adidas received the biggest pay rises , with salaries jumping by 89 percent to an average 1.8 million euros .
thyssenkrupp executives received a 60 percent wage hike to an average 1.5 million euros .
among the lowest earners was germany 's flag carrier lufthansa whose executives took home an average 851,000 euros in 2004 .
keeping and eye on the cookie jar some monitoring agencies point out that these figures are even a low ballpark figure given the fact that managers often receive special pay incentives and bonuses that are kept secret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salaries of the execututives of germany 's top companies continue to rise regardless of performance christiane holz from equity protection , stressed that the current debate is not about envy , but rather that shareholders have a right to know what the employees of their company earn - that includes managers .
" in some companies , the success of a manager is measured in as many as five different variables and the spectrum is broad , " she said .
" unfortunately , these positions are not very well defined or based on any hard facts and figures .
there is also no publication of the previous year ’ s figures which would make it easier to make a comparison . "
transparency difficult to achieve one possible solution would be an orientation toward concrete financial figures , but , according to holz , there are other performance yardsticks .
" for shareholders , figures based on soft factors instead of hard numbers are completely nebulous , " she said .
" managers of the german stock exchange , for example , can increase their salaries with analyses and social skills . "
at adidas , she added , personal performance plays a role , and the variable salary components for managers at tui , the travel company , depend on personal yardstick factors that are not very quantifiable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bull sculpture in front of the frankfurt , germany , stock exchange building is wrapped in blue cloth , the corporate color of deutsche börse ag .
many companies in germany don ’ t even bother with these kinds of smokescreen tactics .
at automobile manufacturer , porsche , the board simply refuses to reveal management salaries .
likewise , the equity protection association has also leveled criticism against german lawmakers , for giving managers a rather large loophole .
strictly speaking , public companies are required to make their salaries public .
but if 75 percent of shareholders vote against it , they don ’ t have to .
critics say that amounts to the end of transparency and amounts to open season for another round of salary hikes . gregg benzow -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .

eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .

it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .
european police investigators routinely complain about a lack of cross-border communication needed to rooting out and arresting terrorist suspects .
the new information system by interpol should go some distance in solving the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the organization 's general meeting in berlin on wednesday , ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- , interpol 's representative at the un security council , said that the computer system included data on 328 people and 119 groups and was available to all of the united nations ' 184 member states , including the european union . the united nations directive that provided the basis for such a system also called for member states to be able to freeze the bank accounts of the people mentioned in the database in july .
according to the un , the potential frozen assets could amount to $ 90 million worldwide . " as they are required by the security council ... these measures fall for the most part outside the scope of judicial review , " said the court in its decision .

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .

on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .

the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .

a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .

on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .

david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .

the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .

it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .

in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.09.2005 german execs criticized for salary jumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : year after year salaries keep rising , despite the stagnant economy board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .
such pay levels touch a sore spot in germany . in germany , executive salaries are a touchy subject given the consistently high unemployment rate and high number of layoffs . still , lackluster economic performance does not necessarily affect the bottom line when it comes to management salaries .
top earner among germany 's 30 largest public companies in 2004 was deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , who took home 6.2 million euros -lrb- $ 7.58 million -rrb- , according to the german association for equity protection .
swiss-born ackermann came under heavy fire earlier this year for cutting or relocating around 6,400 jobs at a time when germany 's biggest bank was enjoying rising profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo of daimlerchrysler ag juergen schrempp , set to leave the company by the end of 2005 .
in second place was the head of german-us automaker daimlerchrysler , jürgen schrempp , whose 2004 pay packet totaled 4.5 million euros .
board members at sportswear maker adidas received the biggest pay rises , with salaries jumping by 89 percent to an average 1.8 million euros .
thyssenkrupp executives received a 60 percent wage hike to an average 1.5 million euros .
among the lowest earners was germany 's flag carrier lufthansa whose executives took home an average 851,000 euros in 2004 .
keeping and eye on the cookie jar some monitoring agencies point out that these figures are even a low ballpark figure given the fact that managers often receive special pay incentives and bonuses that are kept secret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : salaries of the execututives of germany 's top companies continue to rise regardless of performance christiane holz from equity protection , stressed that the current debate is not about envy , but rather that shareholders have a right to know what the employees of their company earn - that includes managers .
" in some companies , the success of a manager is measured in as many as five different variables and the spectrum is broad , " she said .
" unfortunately , these positions are not very well defined or based on any hard facts and figures .
there is also no publication of the previous year ’ s figures which would make it easier to make a comparison . "
transparency difficult to achieve one possible solution would be an orientation toward concrete financial figures , but , according to holz , there are other performance yardsticks .
" for shareholders , figures based on soft factors instead of hard numbers are completely nebulous , " she said .
" managers of the german stock exchange , for example , can increase their salaries with analyses and social skills . "

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .

germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .

in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .

then , changing the tone with , " and now a personal word , " fischer dropped the politicial bomb on an unsuspecting room . " i want my freedom back , " fischer told the green bundestag parliamentary group in a dramatic tone behind closed doors .
witnesses in the chamber reportered that top politicians in the green parliamentary group were brought to tears by fischer 's rousing speech . power exchanged for freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer tells reporters the news as the red-green chapter was now history , fischer said it was time for a new generation of green leaders to take the reigns .
after 20 years , he said he was ready to exchange power for freedom , an unforseen announcement from one who has the reputation of a power-hungry politician . fischer made clear that he would remain at the head of his party only under the most extreme circumstances .
as far as he was concerned , it did n't make any sense for the greens to be in any of the possible governing coalitions under discussion .

the 57-year-old legend will continue to sit in the bundestag as a regular representative . the end of the fischer-era will be the opening of another for some other green politician , though which one it will be still remains open .

the team is now five points ahead of pursuer werder bremen , who lost 1-2 against borussia mönchengladbach . bayern munich 's victory over eintracht frankfurt tuesday evening extends their record run to 15 successive wins - six of them in the current season . " our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .
karimi played a helping hand in the goal , heading back mehmet scholl 's cross for guerrero to score . bremen suffers first defeat of the season up until now , werder bremen had kept up with bayern 's ferocious early pace .
but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .

europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .

the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .

still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .
according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .
" putting -lrb- these technologies -rrb- in luxury models is not my goal , " she said .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .

it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .

moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .

the team is now five points ahead of pursuer werder bremen , who lost 1-2 against borussia mönchengladbach . bayern munich 's victory over eintracht frankfurt tuesday evening extends their record run to 15 successive wins - six of them in the current season . " our run will come to an end at some stage , but it could be in four or five games , " said bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn .
" we have a slight lead over bremen now , but at this level , everything can change in an instant . " peruvian striker paolo guerrero scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute , just six minutes after coming off the bench as a substitute .
bayern was ravaged by injuries prior to the trip to frankfurt with michael ballack , claudio pizarro and owen hargreaves all watching from the sidelines . but while other teams ca n't absorb the loss of such influential players , bayern just called in another string of top stars with iranian international ali karimi shining in ballack 's playmaker role .
karimi played a helping hand in the goal , heading back mehmet scholl 's cross for guerrero to score . bremen suffers first defeat of the season up until now , werder bremen had kept up with bayern 's ferocious early pace .
but the 2004 champions suffered a 2-1 loss at borussia mönchengladbach to slip five points behind the leaders . bremen looked to be on the road to victory when its belgian defender jelle van damme , on a season loan from english team southampton , scored the first goal in the 21st minute . bildunterschrift : jelle van damme -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his goal with teammate ivan klasnic but gladbach picked up in the second period , with thomas broich scoring the 1-1 in the 53rd minute off the inside of the post . bremen 's fate was sealed when captain frank baumann scored an own goal on the hour mark to condemn the team to their first defeat of the season at the nordpark stadium .
baumann had sidefooted a tame cross past his own goalkeeper despite no pressure from the gladbach attackers . " i ca n't explain it , " said baumann .
" i wanted to clear the danger for a corner , but did n't connect with the ball properly . " " we were just too passive and lost all of the 50-50 challenges in the second half , " said bremen 's trainer thomas schaaf .
" we just threw the game away after a good first half . " regional derbys bring forth clear winners borussia dortmund celebrated a home victory against arminia bielefeld , the first since 1997 .
the westphalian battle ended 2-0 , helping dortmund regain a position in the middle ranks of the league . czech player jan koller scored the lead for the host team in the 26th minute .
polish striker ebi smolarek decided the game with his goal in the 83rd minute . " we could n't find any rhythm in the first half and were far too passive , " said arminia 's trainer thomas von heesen about the moderate match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's jiri stajner -lrb- left -rrb- tries to get the ball from wolfsburg 's alex the derby in lower saxony between hanover 96 and wolfsburg ended 2-4 , helping the " wolves " leave their local rival behind in the league ranking . wolfsburg 's mike hanke scored two goals in a row in the 10th and 15th minutes of the game .
diego klimowicz and andres d 'alessandro sealed hanover 's fate with their scores in the 27th and 33rd minutes . the two goals by hanover 's thomas brdaric in the 30th and 89th minutes could n't turn the game around .

increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .

as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .

top earner among germany 's 30 largest public companies in 2004 was deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , who took home 6.2 million euros -lrb- $ 7.58 million -rrb- , according to the german association for equity protection .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .
european police investigators routinely complain about a lack of cross-border communication needed to rooting out and arresting terrorist suspects .
the new information system by interpol should go some distance in solving the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the organization 's general meeting in berlin on wednesday , ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- , interpol 's representative at the un security council , said that the computer system included data on 328 people and 119 groups and was available to all of the united nations ' 184 member states , including the european union . the united nations directive that provided the basis for such a system also called for member states to be able to freeze the bank accounts of the people mentioned in the database in july .
according to the un , the potential frozen assets could amount to $ 90 million worldwide . " as they are required by the security council ... these measures fall for the most part outside the scope of judicial review , " said the court in its decision .
" they do not infringe the universally recognized fundamental human rights .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 germany 's divided political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting behavior is never set in stone , but there are trends pessimists say the only thing uniting many german voters was apprehension about reform .
the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 eu wants smarter cars , safer roads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can ' smart car ' technology prevent accidents ?
the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .
recent developments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gps systems could also help in keep drivers safe despite the benefits of such a system , only two countries – finland and sweden – have signed on to make it a reality .
the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .
this is not just another fancy gadget . "
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car crash a major recipient of eu funding is the integrated project prevent .
it is also an international mix of private and public automotive and regulatory groups whose aim is to develop and demonstrate safety applications and technologies . one prevent subproject is called willwarn , or wireless local danger warning .
currently under development by daimlerchrysler , willwarn is a communication-based system that lets drivers know about dangerous road conditions ahead .
according to a daimler chrysler spokesman , more than 90 percent of all car accidents could be avoided if the drivers are warned in time .
but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .
in frankfurt , she said she hopes her intelligent car program will encourage public authorities to sort out regulatory barriers and speed up innovation so europe can retain its position as the world ’ s leading market for safe , smart and clean vehicles .
" putting -lrb- these technologies -rrb- in luxury models is not my goal , " she said .

increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .

the hesitation elsewhere is due to the costs of putting the necessary response network in place .
still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

but not everyone can afford a mercedes , audi , or other high-end car that might come loaded with such high-tech features , and reding knows it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 germany 's divided political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting behavior is never set in stone , but there are trends pessimists say the only thing uniting many german voters was apprehension about reform .
the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

in its first meeting after sunday 's inconclusive parliamentary vote , the cabinet also voted to extend the mandate for further participation in the un peacekeeping mission in southern sudan by six months , if parliament gives its approval .
defense minister peter struck praised the bundeswehr , which is one part of the international isaf force in afghanistan , as being a stabilizing force in the country .
the presence of peacekeepers has helped ensure that afghanistan is no longer a breeding ground for international terrorism , said struck .
the german parliament , in its pre-election form , will come together for a special session to make the final decision involving the extension .
an overwhelming vote of approval is expected .
besides the time extension , it is expected that troop levels will be raised from 2,250 to 3,000 and the mission area will be expanded . dw-world.de " every soldier is aware of that risk " after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 -pipe- 16:00 utc experts see merkel as chancellor german election experts predict that conservative angela merkel will eventually top incumbent gerhard schröder in the fight for the chancellery , according to a reuters poll .
of the 16 analysts polled , only one believed schröder had a chance at forming a coalition government and blocking out merkel in the coming weeks .
merkel and schröder both claimed germany 's top job after sunday 's election brought miserable results for merkel 's christian democratic union and its sister christian social union .
though the union parties are still the strongest in the bundestag , they do n't have enough of a majority to form their wished-for coalition with the pro-business free democrats .
twelve of the polled experts said they believed merkel would still be able to form a coalition with her as chancellor . dw-world.de party supports merkel as chancellor the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor .

europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .

the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .

still , reding said she expects " a number of eu member states , including germany " to sign on to the plan at an ecall meeting slated for october in brussels. ecall may be the most high profile of these " intelligent car " efforts , but it is by far not the last .
in frankfurt , reding cited recent developments in anti-collision radar as an example of a successful application of eu funding .
" this innovation is the fruit of ... many years of eu research funding and direct regulatory support , " she said .
" eventually the car will be able to detect all that is going on around it , enabling the construction of a protective ‘ cocoon ’ ... and reducing the risk of accidents .

the eu thinks so .
think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .
but these days , manufacturers are looking to higher tech solutions , like computers , sensors and wireless technology , to help keep drivers from harm . can your car chat with the road , and tell you when a patch of ice is up ahead ?
can it sense when you are about to have an accident – and slam on the breaks on your behalf ?
if you accidentally hit a pedestrian , could it shoot out an external airbag , cushioning the blow ?
or might it automatically call emergency services if there is breakdown , while recording the data about the accident and sending it to the authorities ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intelligent pedestrian protection system by siemens , 2003 .
the hood lifts up slightly to soften a pedestrian accident not all of these safety measures are commonplace yet , but the european union hopes they soon will be - and many more as well .
increasingly , automakers and safety regulators are developing " embedded technology " – advanced sensors and semiconductors built into the car - to either prevent accidents or stabilize vehicles in a crash .
revving up ' ecars ' the technical advances dovetail nicely with european policy .
europe is busily trying to promote auto safety , while boosting its automobile and high-tech industries .
the eu commissioner for information society and media , viviane reding , -lrb- photo , below -rrb- clearly sees information and communication technology , or ict , as the salvation of europe ’ s automobile industry .
at the international motor show in frankfurt last week , she launched the eu ’ s " intelligent car " project , part of a larger effort to create more high-tech jobs in europe .
and she reiterated her plea for more countries to get on board her ecall emergency-call-technology initiative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viviane reding in 2003 , the european commission publicly set itself a goal of cutting the number of deaths from road accidents in half by 2010 .
-lrb- in germany , more than 7,700 people still die every year in car accidents and over 520,000 people are injured . -rrb-
the ecall action plan was a response to that goal .
its aim is to equip all cars in europe with automatic emergency-call technology by 2009 .
reding said she expects it to reduce road-accident fatalities by five to ten percent .
" the ecall system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year and it will reduce the seriousness of injuries by allowing quicker medical treatment , " reding said .
" after an accident , ecall generates an emergency mobile phone call either manually by vehicle occupants or by an automatic activation of in-vehicle sensors .
the emergency call carries voice and data directly to the nearest emergency service call center .

merkel and schröder both claimed germany 's top job after sunday 's election brought miserable results for merkel 's christian democratic union and its sister christian social union .

of the 16 analysts polled , only one believed schröder had a chance at forming a coalition government and blocking out merkel in the coming weeks .
merkel and schröder both claimed germany 's top job after sunday 's election brought miserable results for merkel 's christian democratic union and its sister christian social union .
though the union parties are still the strongest in the bundestag , they do n't have enough of a majority to form their wished-for coalition with the pro-business free democrats .
twelve of the polled experts said they believed merkel would still be able to form a coalition with her as chancellor . dw-world.de party supports merkel as chancellor the knives are back in their sheaths .
the overwhelming support for angela merkel from her own party has defused speculation that she does n't have the backing to become germany 's next chancellor .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .

eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .

moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .

but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .

some say the music is too loud , others say it 's too quiet .
the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .

the dispute over noise levels on the theresienwiese has people lining up along generational lines . at this year 's oktoberfest in southern germany , newly curbed music volumes at the tents of munich 's six major breweries have many of the festival 's younger visitors voicing their discontent .
" all we 've heard are complaints , " explained toni roiderer , a representative for proprietors of the annual event which some are now calling " whisperfest " after the initiative to lower the decibels a few notches .
" it was a good try , but i 'm convinced that it is doing more harm then good , " he acknowledged .
in protest , many guests simply stood on the tables and sang party hits in a kind of impromptu choir .
sometimes they belted it out louder than the music .
keeping a lid on the party after a decision made by the munich city council earlier this year , the hosts of germany 's biggest folk festival opted to tamp down the mood a little this year by implementing a decibel level restriction as well as a policy to not play " hot " music before 6:00 p.m.
these restrictions however , only apply to weekdays and are only realistic up until the afternoon , when the tents are still not very full , surmised roiderer .
" if the noise level in the tents is 90 decibels , you ca n't play music at only 85 .
that 's like watching the conductor move his hands without being able to hear anything , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waitress carries beer mugs during the opening ceremony of the oktoberfest in munich , southern germany festival vendors want a quick regulation .
they think the music should be appropriate for the noise level in the tents .
" that would be a good solution , if decibel levels were adjusted to the level of our guests , " they conceded .
but it 's not likely there will be an agreement on the noise level any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off is the bundesliga too weak ? ballack header saves bayern record bremen stick with record breaking bayern sports -pipe- 21.09.2005 teams fight to keep pace with bayern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg players jarolim -lrb- l -rrb- and van der vaart put the squeeze on on tuesday , it became more and more clear that the league must fight hard to keep up with bayern munich .
on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.09.2005 eu data-storage plan worries critics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phone calls , e-mails , text messages : its all fair game in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .
but the lawmakers ' zeal is making privacy activists nervous . data taken from cell phone calls led to the capture of those behind train bombings in madrid in 2004 .
now , the european union has submitted a bill to unify regulations governing the storage of data from telephones , cell phones , and e-mail .
if passed , the bill would force phone networks in the eu to retain traffic data for one year , and internet access providers for six months , for possible use in investigating organized crime and terrorism .
bill needs approval the bill , which in recent years has stalled over privacy issues , must win approval from all 25 eu governments to take eu-wide effect .
negotiations on data retention have made no progress in the past due to privacy concerns in some eu capitals and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini but eu justice commissioner franco frattini -lrb- photo -rrb- said the bill would not apply to the content of communications , only to numbers dialed , locations used , and web sites that officials may want to explor in connection with criminal investigations .
some member states worry that involving the european parliament will slow down legislation .
eu lawmakers are seen as being more open to pressure from industry campaigners and civil liberties groups to water down the proposals .
german mp voices concern european member of parliament alexander alvaro , who represents germany 's free democrat party in brussels , expressed mixed feelings regarding the commission 's proposal .
for one thing , the commission is now seeking to store yet more data than had originally been suggested , he said .
moreover , the committee charged with deciding how much data should be stored in the future is not subject to any parliamentary control , alvaro complained in an interview with dw-world.de. but he agreed that the commission bill also had some good points .
it is the first time that it was clear that industry may need to be reimbursed for additional costs , even if the ruling on this is left to member states .
in addition , the commission said it would run periodic checks to evaluate whether retaining the data is actually useful .
privacy compromised heiner busch , editor of the german magazine " civil rights and the police " and directing manager of the committee for basic rights in cologne , categorically rejected the eu plan .
" there is no proof that such preventive controls are effective , but it compromises telephone privacy , " busch said .
" this discussion began even before the attacks of sept .

after 20 years , he said he was ready to exchange power for freedom , an unforseen announcement from one who has the reputation of a power-hungry politician . fischer made clear that he would remain at the head of his party only under the most extreme circumstances .
as far as he was concerned , it did n't make any sense for the greens to be in any of the possible governing coalitions under discussion .
still , he said he would continue to take part in the negotiations , as long as it had to do with governing . following his announcement , the green mps celebrated fischer with a standing ovation lasting minutes .
the extraordinary orator is valued by his party as indispensible .
many see fischer as part and parcel of the greens , and can not fathom the party without his leadership . avoiding the conduct of chancellor kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two symbols of the green party : joschka and sunflowers in stepping back from the top position in the party , fischer said he was avoiding the fashion in which former chancellor helmut kohl continued to lurk about his party , attempting to exert influence though his time had passed .
he would not " accompany the party silently from the back rows , " fischer said . though he will be relinquishing his post as foreign minister and symbolic leader of the greens , fischer does not plan to completely retire from politics quite yet .
the 57-year-old legend will continue to sit in the bundestag as a regular representative . the end of the fischer-era will be the opening of another for some other green politician , though which one it will be still remains open .
a scramble for the co-chief position of the bundestag parliamentary group has already begun , with consumer protection minister renate künast and environment minister jürgen trittin challenging the incumbent parliamentary group chiefs katrin göring-eckhardt and krista sager . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties mull coalition options germany 's main political parties began reaching out to their political opponents after sunday 's election left all of them without a majority .

german politicians and the press were divided on tuesday on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .
-lrb- april 26 , 2005 -rrb- germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

'
in an address to the un general assembly , a top german diplomat said the country would continue its efforts to reform the security council , and made a plea for the body to reach its millennium goals . german deputy foreign minister klaus scharioth addressed the united nations in new york tuesday , standing in for foreign minister joschka fischer , who was busy with election dealings back home .
in a self confident speech , scharioth expressed germany 's commitment to the organization but said further reform is crucial .
germany , along with japan , brazil and india , is involved in a bid for a seat on a reformed and enlarged un security council .
scharioth , germany 's number-two diplomat , started off by asking the organization to hold to recent promises , and try to actually meet development goals set at the millennium summit in 2000 .
support for afghanistan the eight goals , which were set to be reached by 2015 , include a 50 percent reduction in poverty and hunger ; universal primary education ; and reduction of child mortality by two-thirds , among others .
he followed up this plea with a short look back at un engagement over the last years and months in various regions of the world , calling the diplomatic body a symbol for protection , aid , peace and reconstruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g4 ministers from germany , japan , india brazil with un general assembly president jean ping scharioth said germany would " continue to do its utmost to support afghanistan , " and also spoke about germany 's financial and ideological contributions toward building democracy and constitutionality in iraq .
" we want all iraqis to live free of fear and material hardship .
terror and violence should not take the upper hand .
the middle east needs a stable , prosperous iraq . "
regarding the nuclear program in neighboring iran , scharioth complained that earlier progress was being frivolously compromised .
without naming any names , he indirectly criticized the us as being at the heart of the problem .
call for reform " if we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction - especially nuclear weapons - then all countries must fulfill their obligations .
at the same time , we have to see to it that new energy comes into nuclear disarmament . "
and he called for all member states to take an active part in reforming the united nations , which includes creating a peacebuilding commission and a new human rights council , as well as reforming of the security council .
" a reform of the united nations that does not include the security council does n't deserve the name ' reform ' .
the council runs the risk of losing its authority and legitimacy if whole continents and important donors are not proportionately represented . "
germany and its partners brazil , india and japan are sticking to their concept of a comprehensive reform plan , scharioth said .
in addition , germany expressed alarm that commercial and state creditors are providing less and less debt relief for poor developing countries .
scharioth called on the 191 un member states to support " an extensive cancellation of debts , including multilateral debts " at this weekend 's meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund . thomas nehls -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran makes nuke partnership offer at un iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad unveiled proposals , including an offer of foreign involvement in its uranium enrichment program , at the un on saturday in a bid to end the standoff over tehran 's nuclear ambitions .

swedish resident ahmed ali yusuf , and yassin abdullah kadi , who lives in saudi arabia , along with the al barakaat international foundation in holland , complained to the court that such action fell outside of the european union 's jurisdiction . they also fought their mention on the united nations list of people suspected of ties to al qaeda and the taliban .
but the high court dismissed their claims , saying that the eu - which has the power to hang economic sanctions on third countries - also has the power to freeze the assets of individuals .
" it is within the powers of the european community to order the freezing of individuals ' funds in connection with the fight against terrorism , " according to the court . more punch in anti-terror fight the decision , coupled with a new information system introduced by the international police agency interpol , has added some much-needed punch in the european union 's anti-terror fight .
european police investigators routinely complain about a lack of cross-border communication needed to rooting out and arresting terrorist suspects .
the new information system by interpol should go some distance in solving the problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the organization 's general meeting in berlin on wednesday , ulrich kersten -lrb- photo -rrb- , interpol 's representative at the un security council , said that the computer system included data on 328 people and 119 groups and was available to all of the united nations ' 184 member states , including the european union . the united nations directive that provided the basis for such a system also called for member states to be able to freeze the bank accounts of the people mentioned in the database in july .
according to the un , the potential frozen assets could amount to $ 90 million worldwide . " as they are required by the security council ... these measures fall for the most part outside the scope of judicial review , " said the court in its decision .
" they do not infringe the universally recognized fundamental human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.09.2005 germany 's divided political landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voting behavior is never set in stone , but there are trends pessimists say the only thing uniting many german voters was apprehension about reform .
the political map reveals a deep divide between east and west , as well as north and south . if the results of germany 's federal elections on sunday are color-coded on a map , the division immediately hits the eye .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , represented by the color red , got most of their backing in the northern and eastern parts of the country . on the other hand , the conservative christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- - signified by the color black - have a firm grip on bavaria , baden-württemberg and rhineland-palatinate in the south , with a few pockets in northern and western regions . the background of various regions plays a key role in how people there vote .
the northern part of germany is traditionally protestant , for example .
in these areas , 40.7 percent of the vote went to the spd .
only 32 percent of predominantly protestant regions voted for the cdu / csu . the catholic south shows the opposite trend .
largely catholic areas gave 46 percent of the vote to the cdu / csu .
the spd was only able to win 28.4 percent of these votes . workers vote left the economic structure of a region also plays a significant role in voter behavior .
the ruhr district , the industrial heartland of germany , is traditionally a bastion of social democratic support , for example . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former krupp smelting works in duisburg are in a spd stronghold the duisburg north constituency , right in the heart of the ruhr , is where the spd has its safest seat nationwide .
candidate johannes pflug took 61.6 percent of the vote there .
but it involved a lot of hard work on his part , too . " we campaigned in bars , we held parties and political discussions , we went on bike rides , " said pflug .
" we really went out to meet the people .
it was incredibly intensive , much more than we have ever done in the past . " pflug 's strong performance has gone some way to heal the wounds of the past year for duisburg 's social democrats .
the low point was when they lost the state elections in north rhine-westphalia , an spd stronghold for decades , earlier this year .
it was that regional election result that had prompted chancellor gerhard schröder to call new elections in the first place . city dwellers prefer the spd large cities also tended to lean more toward red than black .
the spd won 38.2 percent of the vote in big cities , compared to 26.7 percent for the cdu / csu .
the northern district of munich followed this trend , despite its position in bavaria , which gave almost half of its vote to the csu .
it marks the only red spot on the otherwise black map of this state . the greens are also more attractive for city dwellers , who gave this party 11.9 percent of their vote . rural regions show a different picture .
a total of 40.6 percent of people living there gave the cdu / csu the vote .
the spd could only gain 29.3 percent in rural areas and the green party just 5.3 percent . this matches the trend for predominantly agricultural regions , which gave 42.4 percent of their vote to the cdu / csu .
only 29.6 percent of people in farming districts voted for the spd and 5.7 percent for the greens . spd holds position in eastern germany the spd saw significant losses in eastern germany , but was still the strongest party there .
its strongest opponent was the newly-formed socialist left party , which polled some 25 percent of the vote in this region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine are the top candidates of germany 's new left-wing party frankfurt on oder , for example , is a depressed area with very high unemployment .
the left party , led by gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine -lrb- photo -rrb- , was able to score well here - as high as 38 percent in some districts . the left party is an alliance between the newly-formed work and social justice party , and the pds , the successor party to east germany 's communist party .
in the west , it only really did well in lafontaine 's home state of saarland , where it got 18.5 percent of the vote .
but in places like frankfurt on oder , it 's the second strongest force following the spd . many areas in western germany face the same problems of high unemployment and a lack of future prospects .
but unlike the left party , the spd has a long tradition of support here that it can draw on . on a national level , areas with high unemployment gave 33.7 percent of their vote to the spd , followed by the cdu / csu with 26 percent and the left party with 20.1 percent . as a whole , german men tended to vote more conservatively , with 36 percent choosing the cdu / csu and 33 percent the spd .
german women , though , were equally divided , no matter where they lived or what they did .
female germans gave equal votes of 35 percent to both major parties . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .

on wednesday , berlin , leverkusen and hamburg all won hard-fought matches to keep pace with the defending champs . if only rudi völler would stay on as coach at leverkusen .
that must be the thoughts of the team ’ s supporters and players after the club won its second match under his leadership following the firing of klaus augenthaler last week .
on wednesday , andrey voronin and simon rolfes provided the power in a 2-1 victory over rhine river rivals fc cologne .
for ukrainian striker voronin , it was even more emotional because cologne gave him out on loan to leverkusen last season and he decided to stay there despite cologne ’ s return to the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's lukas podolski runs away from his leverkusen opponent but his club could n't hide as leverkusen won “ i took it upon myself most importantly to score a goal because it had been a while since i scored one , ” he said after the match that until the end remained surprisingly calm between the two bitter rivals .
as regular time almost expired , cologne forward matthias scherz and international midfielder bernd schneider were given their marching orders after a scuffle inside the leverkusen penalty box .
the luck of rudi völler continues for leverkusen and the team lies in fifth-place on ten points , eight behind leader bayern .
hamburg jump into second bremen ’ s stumble against a none too strong mönchengladbach on tuesday was incentive for their northern neighbor hamburg to take over second-place -lrb- 14 points -rrb- , and they did this with a 2-1 victory against stuttgart .
david jarolim snatched the victory for thomas doll ’ s side with a goal that could best be described as lucky for the visitors as his shot deflected high into the air off stuttgart keeper timo hildebrand ’ s leg and somehow landed in the net .
totally skillful was the spectacular goal by dutch international midfielder rafael van der vaart , who from some 16 meters out curled a ball into the upper righthand corner past a completely helpless hildebrand .
the loss does not bode well for stuttgart ’ s first-year trainer giovanni trappatoni , whose club has managed to scratch together only six points in six matches .
it ’ s hardly what the maestro expected in his return to the bundesliga .
the swabians are certainly not providing the support on the field for their italian coach but they feel they are “ getting better each week , ” which is the assessment of defender andreas hinkel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's sven mueller -lrb- l -rrb- and schalke 's ferreira rafinha from brazil challenge for the ball not improving each week are schalke who came away from nuremberg with just a 1-1 draw .
the expected title contenders have yet to lose a match but have only won two before drawing four times in a row .
the lack of offense -lrb- seven goals -rrb- despite the addition of german international forward kevin kuranyi has put coach ralf rangnick under increasing pressure , most directly from club director rudi assauer .
berlin pull out last gasp win hertha berlin turned around a poor performance in the first hour and defeated promoted side duisburg 3-2 , catapulting falko götz ' team into fourth-place on 11 points .
things looked promising for the capital city club very early after marko pantelic headed in a goal in the sixth minute , the team ’ s very first first-half goal this season .
duisburg reversed the game on strikes from ivica grlic and marino biliskov .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's yildiray bastürk -lrb- r -rrb- fights for the ball with duisburg 's thomas baelum .
bastürk lost this duel but his team won the match berlin were the beneficiaries of a questionable penalty kick in the 71st minute that marcelinho hammered home .
the colorful brazilian midfielder then sent in a cross that nando rafael headed into the net in the 90th minute .
a hard blow for the “ zebras ” who in the words of goalscorer ivica grlic “ never had an easier opportunity to go back to the ruhr valley with three points . ”
in the final match , mainz could climb out of the cellar standings by winning on the road against nearby rivals kaiserslautern , 2-0 .
michael thurk put his side on top in the 38th minute .
ciriaco sforza did the home side a disservice by drawing the red card just before halftime .
benjamin auer then seal kaiserslautern ’ s fate , who fought courageously despite playing with ten men , with a goal in the 90th minute . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich keeps top bundesliga slot bayern munich maintained their 100 percent start to the season with a 1-0 win over eintracht frankfurt .

the couple walked past most of the 2,000 people in london 's leicester square without signing autographs .
the gangster film 's star jason statham spent almost an hour meeting fans .
one fan later told the bbc news website that the booing was started by the press when they were unable to take good photos of the couple .
ritchie hit back at savage reviews , telling reporters : " the critics have been harsh all the way through my career but it does n't affect me . "
the bad critical reaction was inevitable because the film 's concept was " tricky " , he added .
asked why he did not give madonna a role , ritchie replied : " do you think they would let me get away with that ?
i did that last time , it did n't work . "
ritchie directed his wife in swept away three years ago , but the result was derided by both cinemagoers and the press .
the hollywood reporter said box office takings would be " modest " but madonna defended her husband 's new work , telling sky news : " i love it .
i think it 's a very brave film , a bit macho . "
she also said she enjoyed not having to work the red carpet , saying it was fun to just " dress up and show up " .
her sling , a result of a broken collarbone and hand and three cracked ribs , will be coming off in a week , she revealed .
ritchie made his name with hit gangster films lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch .
revolver features statham as a criminal who revives a feud with a gangland boss .
it also stars ray liotta and andre 3000 of hip-hop group outkast .
" after revolver , swept away now looks like citizen kane , " the guardian newspaper said .

the couple walked past most of the 2,000 people in london 's leicester square without signing autographs .
the gangster film 's star jason statham spent almost an hour meeting fans .
one fan later told the bbc news website that the booing was started by the press when they were unable to take good photos of the couple .
ritchie hit back at savage reviews , telling reporters : " the critics have been harsh all the way through my career but it does n't affect me . "
the bad critical reaction was inevitable because the film 's concept was " tricky " , he added .
asked why he did not give madonna a role , ritchie replied : " do you think they would let me get away with that ?
i did that last time , it did n't work . "
ritchie directed his wife in swept away three years ago , but the result was derided by both cinemagoers and the press .
the hollywood reporter said box office takings would be " modest " but madonna defended her husband 's new work , telling sky news : " i love it .
i think it 's a very brave film , a bit macho . "
she also said she enjoyed not having to work the red carpet , saying it was fun to just " dress up and show up " .
her sling , a result of a broken collarbone and hand and three cracked ribs , will be coming off in a week , she revealed .
ritchie made his name with hit gangster films lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch .
revolver features statham as a criminal who revives a feud with a gangland boss .
it also stars ray liotta and andre 3000 of hip-hop group outkast .
" after revolver , swept away now looks like citizen kane , " the guardian newspaper said .
" ritchie 's new film lands on cinemagoers ' collective heads like a sack of wet sand . "
variety magazine has called it " tedious " and " convoluted " while the hollywood reporter criticised its " pretentious style " .

its dramas have always been kept up to a high standard , although it has been through a recent period when that standard was not quite so high .
people do not know what comedy to expect on itv because mostly they do not expect any nevertheless , moving the news at ten has proved advantageous to itv because it has enabled viewers to get stuck into a two-hour or 90-minute drama in the evening .

they used to do a lot of variety entertainment , and it has the audience for it - but reality television has come on in such a big way , it seems to fill the schedules .

itv is lagging behind on its nature programming - they do so little of it .
they should do their own version of -lsb- bbc series -rsb- nature watch with proper real-time cameras so i can just check what is going on with the wildlife throughout the day .

producers , entertainers and critics share their view on the channel 's past and future .
lord bragg germaine greer kathryn flett beryl vertue eric sykes jaci stephen lord bragg lord bragg has edited and presented the south bank show for the past 26 years .
he is also granada 's controller of arts and features . "
itv is in extremely robust shape financially .
good money is still being dedicated to television despite the grumbles of producers about budgets , which are the same grumbles we have always had . "
it is the only credible competitor to the bbc " granada has the likes of coronation street , prime suspect and ant and dec .
that 's a big hand to have .
there have been a few own goals like the departure of richard and judy and the failure of itv digital .
but itv is still unique as a commercial broadcaster of great success and as a public service broadcaster of distinction .
it is the only credible competitor to the bbc .
if itv goes splat , then the bbc will get constipated .
of course , itv is going to go through rough patches .
there were times at lwt when we were too afraid to look at weekend ratings .
itv will bounce back .
we have some of the best cards in the british tv pack . "
beryl vertue beryl vertue obe has produced a raft of hit comedy series including men behaving badly and is executive producer of new bbc series carrie and barry and supernova . "
i watch itv a lot , both as a viewer and a producer .
its dramas have always been kept up to a high standard , although it has been through a recent period when that standard was not quite so high . "
people do not know what comedy to expect on itv because mostly they do not expect any " nevertheless , moving the news at ten has proved advantageous to itv because it has enabled viewers to get stuck into a two-hour or 90-minute drama in the evening .
i have not made many comedy series with itv , mainly because i do not know where it would schedule them .
people do not know what comedy to expect on itv because mostly they do not expect any .
itv 's approach to comedy has become a bit scattergun .
watching the vintage clips shown for the channel 's 50th anniversary , it struck me that there seems to be less fun and variety on itv now .
they used to do a lot of variety entertainment , and it has the audience for it - but reality television has come on in such a big way , it seems to fill the schedules .
some reality shows are wonderful and some are hideous - itv has had its fair share of both .
itv knows its audience well as far as drama is concerned , but when it comes to other types of programming , it no longer seems as turned on as it used to be . "
germaine greer feminist author germaine greer delivered the alternative mactaggart lecture at this year 's edinburgh tv festival . "
i barely watch itv now , although my friends in australia stay in to watch every episode of the bill . "
the channels all seem to end up making the same programme " the only thing i watch regularly on itv is gmtv , although when kate garraway returns i will stop watching it altogether .
itv is lagging behind on its nature programming - they do so little of it .
they should do their own version of -lsb- bbc series -rsb- nature watch with proper real-time cameras so i can just check what is going on with the wildlife throughout the day .
at the moment , the channels all seem to end up making the same programme .
i would like to see itv make a gardening programme that is actually about the biodiversity of the garden .
they could explain why it is ridiculous for these shows to cover a garden all over with american treated redwood and stick a drinks table on top of it . "
eric sykes comedian eric sykes made a series of specials for itv from the 1950s onwards , including his remake of the plank in 1979 . "

at the time , baggage handlers walked out for two days in sympathy with sacked workers at the airline 's in-flight caterer gate gourmet .
british airways said two of the shop stewards have been suspended on full pay while the third continues to work .
all three are members of the transport & general workers ' union -lrb- t & g -rrb- .
a spokesman for the t & g confirmed that disciplinary action has started against three of its members , but declined to comment further .
the ba baggage handlers went out on wildcat strike after gate gourmet 's loss making uk division sacked 667 workers at heathrow in a dispute over working practices and the hiring of temporary staff .
staff information the ba walkout left more than 100,000 passengers stranded and cost the airline an estimated £ 40m -lrb- $ 72m -rrb- .
the sacked gate gourmet workers campaigned hard against the firm following the dispute , ba set up a confidential phone line as part of its investigation .
employees were invited to ring the number to report any incidents of alleged bullying or intimidation that led to the strike action .
the three union officials now being probed were reportedly named by staff calling the hotline .
ba said it could not give out anymore information as the investigation was ongoing .
' troublemakers ' negotiations are continuing to end the gate gourmet dispute , with all staff - including those that were sacked - having been offered redundancy packages .
about 700 staff - 300 of those sacked and 400 from current employees - have applied to accept the offer , according to the t & g. yet one area of disagreement appears to still need to be resolved - gate gourmet 's insistence that it will definitely not re-employ 200 so-called " troublemakers " .
while the us-owned caterer has secured the improved ba contract it says its uk operation needs to secure its financial survival , but this is dependent upon gate gourmet resolving the labour dispute .

two-thirds of mobile and personal digital assistant owners in a marketing survey across 15 countries said two days ' active battery life was vital .
it also showed almost half wanted more memory , and a high-resolution camera .
the findings come as the electronics industry scrambles to develop the next essential device in people 's pockets .

" the study shows that there is an appetite among consumers for powerful new applications , particularly those around entertainment media and imaging , " said hanis harun , from tns .
" however , the research also indicates that consumers now fully realise that such applications require enhanced battery life and increased memory and they are demanding these improvements as a priority . "
fourteen of the 15 countries in the research agreed that a battery that lasted two days while in active use was essential .

perthshire msp john swinney said the route was one of the most deadly in scotland with 82 deaths in the last five years .
the former snp leader said the road was " fundamentally unsafe " .
the transport minister said the £ 600m for a full upgrade was not available and that promise had not been made .
speaking on bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , mr swinney said : " the government has promised to undertake junction improvements and promised this in 2002 . "
when we get information that this is the deadliest road in scotland , we need urgent action from the government " john swinney msp " it promised to have the work finished by the spring of this year and there is not a single piece of construction at this junction started .
" when we get information that this is the deadliest road in scotland , we need urgent action from the government . "
mr swinney said the change from single road to dual carriageway along the route created " a climate of confusion " .
transport minister tavish scott said he was frustrated that a planned upgrade of the ballinluig junction had not been completed .
upgrade work the scottish executive has said improvement work on the junction at ballinluig , near aberfeldy had been delayed due to poor ground conditions .
mr scott conceded the a9 had bad road traffic statistics and said ministers were aware of the public 's safety concerns .
he added : " we will make sure construction work starts on the ballinluig next year .
" i entirely appreciate the frustrations about that particular junction .
but it 's also about how we drive on the road . "
" no government has said it would spend the £ 600m to dual the entire length of the a9 , which is what 's being called for " tavish scott transport minister the minister said he was " very , very disappointed " that engineering constraints had contributed to the upgrade delay .
" i am fed up with it too and want it sorted . "
on the issue of a full upgrade , he said : " we do n't have the money for that right now .
no government has said it would spend the £ 600m to dual the entire length of the a9 , which is what 's being called for .
" i think it 's important to get the balance right between improved safety , better signage and making sure we do solve the issues that have rightly been raised . "
mr scott said ministers were keen to encourage more commuters to travel to perth by train rather than car .
he added that other roads in scotland carried more traffic than the a9 and people would say they , too , needed to be upgraded .
sue nicholson , of the rac foundation , said motorists could become too easily frustrated on the main road north .
" the biggest problem is probably where it goes from single carriageway to dual carriageway , " she said .
" people become extremely impatient when they get stuck behind a queue of traffic and they try to pass and overtake in inappropriate places and that 's often the cause of problems . "

perthshire msp john swinney said the route was one of the most deadly in scotland with 82 deaths in the last five years .
the former snp leader said the road was " fundamentally unsafe " .
the transport minister said the £ 600m for a full upgrade was not available and that promise had not been made .
speaking on bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , mr swinney said : " the government has promised to undertake junction improvements and promised this in 2002 .
when we get information that this is the deadliest road in scotland , we need urgent action from the government john swinney msp " it promised to have the work finished by the spring of this year and there is not a single piece of construction at this junction started .
" when we get information that this is the deadliest road in scotland , we need urgent action from the government . "
mr swinney said the change from single road to dual carriageway along the route created " a climate of confusion " .
transport minister tavish scott said he was frustrated that a planned upgrade of the ballinluig junction had not been completed .
upgrade work the scottish executive has said improvement work on the junction at ballinluig , near aberfeldy had been delayed due to poor ground conditions .
mr scott conceded the a9 had bad road traffic statistics and said ministers were aware of the public 's safety concerns .
he added : " we will make sure construction work starts on the ballinluig next year .
" i entirely appreciate the frustrations about that particular junction .
but it 's also about how we drive on the road . "
no government has said it would spend the £ 600m to dual the entire length of the a9 , which is what 's being called for tavish scott transport minister the minister said he was " very , very disappointed " that engineering constraints had contributed to the upgrade delay .
" i am fed up with it too and want it sorted . "
on the issue of a full upgrade , he said : " we do n't have the money for that right now .
no government has said it would spend the £ 600m to dual the entire length of the a9 , which is what 's being called for .
" i think it 's important to get the balance right between improved safety , better signage and making sure we do solve the issues that have rightly been raised . "
the executive said it did not have the funds to upgrade the a9 mr scott said ministers were keen to encourage more commuters to travel to perth by train rather than car .
he added that other roads in scotland carried more traffic than the a9 and people would say they , too , needed to be upgraded .
sue nicholson , of the rac foundation , said motorists could become too easily frustrated on the main road north .
" the biggest problem is probably where it goes from single carriageway to dual carriageway , " she said .
" people become extremely impatient when they get stuck behind a queue of traffic and they try to pass and overtake in inappropriate places and that 's often the cause of problems . "
