now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2005 news of homegrown bombers shocks uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have uncovered disturbing evidence concerning the bombers police in britain are hunting for a mastermind behind the london bombings that they believe directed the four suspected attackers - muslims of pakistani origin - at least three of whom were born and raised in britain . british authorities said they were hunting wednesday for the masterminds of last week 's bombings in london amid shock over the news that the attacks were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .
his driving permit and other personal effects were reported found in the remains of the bus . police gained vital clues from hussain 's parents , who knew their son was in london and were unable to contact him by phone once the bombs went off , the times said .
none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .
it does not , in any way , close this case , " the times said in an editorial .
" is it really possible that no one beyond the bombers had any inkling of their intentions ? " it asked .
the guardian , for its part , described news that the bombers were british as " the worst of all possible outcomes . ...
it will have been the work of people brought up in our multi-racial society of which policy-makers were rightly proud .
this is not just a challenge for government but for civic society , too . "
the bombs on the london underground trains - near the aldgate , edgware road and king 's cross stations - went off at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .
at least 52 people died , although some reports have said the final toll could approach 70 as police continue to search the wreckage of one of the trains in a tunnel deep under london . fighting the problem at the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in prime minister tony blair 's weekly question time in parliament , he announced a plan to uproot the problem of religious extremism .
ministers will begin consultations on planned counter-terrorism legislation within the next couple of weeks , blair said .
prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .
the prime minister also said his government would begin talks immediately with british muslim leaders about combating the " poisonous and perverted misinterpretation of the religion of islam " by mobilizing moderate opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigation of london bombings heats up british police declared their first arrest tuesday in connection with the london bombings and said at least one bomber is confirmed to have been killed as the pieces began to fall together in a fast-moving probe .

spain 's , however , is soaring , thanks to the same german money that thwarts growth at home . decades after its emergence as a tourist hot spot , spain , with its sun-soaked costas , is leading the european pack both in terms of increasing house prices and construction levels .
in 2004 , more new properties went up in spain than were built in germany and the benelux countries combined .
that , even though the population of the country is just 40 million .
although spain has one of the highest rates of owner occupancy in europe , the number of new buildings - some 600,000 last year - far outstrips domestic demand . but then , they are not necessarily being built with the spaniards in mind .
au contraire .
many of the sparkling white apartment blocks which rage into the mediterranean sky are earmarked for foreigners from the outset .
the industry has been dubbed residential tourism , and its key players are the germans and brits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have opened the doors to a new way of life although the idea of having a second home in sunnier climes is not new , the trend is moving away from the traditional groups of pensioners . cheap air travel to an ever increasing number of destinations and the opportunities the internet offers for flexible working , combine to entice more and more young people to leave the cloudy confines of northern europe to both relax and work in the glory of the spanish sun . " infinitely better way to live " zoe hall of lighthouse real estate agents says there 's a whole new generation of people itching to live the good life . " essentially people are looking for a different way of life .
they are no longer satisfied with a two-week package holiday , but want somewhere they can go four or five times a year , " she said .
" it 's attractive for young couples with children .
they can be outside all the time , and it 's an infinitely better way to live . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular spot near valencia but how good is it for local communities ?
thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .
" we can live side by side , but sometimes it 's a bit galling when you go to a local café and have to order your coffee in english , " garcia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love their mallorcan sangria she also laments what is known as the " german invasion " on the island of mallorca , which she says has completely changed the face of the place . but heidi stadler , who has run a real estate agency on the island for the past decade , believes that locals have gained more than they 've lost through the prolific german presence there . " the fact is that tourists bring money to the island , whether they are there for two weeks or six months .
there is a minority group which complains about how expensive the island has become , but such criticism stuns me because everyone in mallorca benefits from the upturn the germans have facilitated .
there are international schools , better roads and hospitals , and they are there for everyone on the island , not just the germans , " she said . just keep on smiling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buyers get more for their money inland that is little consolation to young spaniards whose salaries have risen at less than quarter of the rate of house prices over the past few years .
but even as they struggle to buy their dream home in their home country , the spaniards are aware that they have the eu to thank for the new level of affluence in the nation . even anita garcia concedes that spain does n't wish to witness a return to its more barren pre-eu days .
" spain wo n't bite the hand that feeds it , and will ultimately agree to go along with anything to remain in the european fold , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german construction flourishes abroad german construction companies are having a tough time at home , and after walter bau filed for bankruptcy earlier this week more firms are looking to for profits outside of germany - where business is booming .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .

the head of the volkswagen group , bernd pischetsrieder , is to take over human resources responsibilities temporarily , he said .
wulff made his remarks at the end of a meeting of the four-member inner council of the vw supervisory board .
hartz had offered his resignation on friday after being mentioned in german press reports in connection with alleged corruption at the company .
his name is associated with landmark labor agreements in the company , notably over a four-day work week in 1993 which saved nearly 30,000 jobs .
some analysts have suggested that his departure might open the way for the group to introduce tough cost-cutting measures .
a source close to the matter said that vw was eyeing savings of some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- over the next three years . dw-world.de vw scandal puts pressure on works council the growing bribery scandal at volkswagen has led critics to challenge the system of co-determination in labor relations .
it was long considered the springboard for west germany 's postwar economic miracle .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .

adolf hitler 's regime blurred the line between the two , which led to a ruthless militarized police state . army deployment " highly dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily told a news conference that he believed it would be wrong to give the military any new role in preventing terror attacks .
" from a psychological point of view it would give the impression that we are in a permanent state of emergency and that is highly dangerous . " " we simply ca n't allow this .
we ca n't let the terrorists bring us to such a state , " he added . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- revealed a hard-line approach to terror in their election platform released on monday , four days after suspected islamist militants killed at least 52 people in four explosions on the london transport system . cdu outlines possible domestic roles for military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a section of the document entitled " a more forceful fight against terror , crime and vandalism , " the cdu maps out a plan to give the bundeswehr , germany 's army , expanded rights to defend the country against terrorist threats .
current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .
" if the cdu and csu are already thinking of using the army for security during the world cup in 2006 , then they are harming the entire police profession , " wolfgang speck , head of the police union , said . bosbach advocates bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach fended off the criticism and said his party would push for a change to the constitution .
" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .
both have troops deployed in iraq . while germany may consider itself to be less of a target due to its non-involvement in iraq , german troops have been active in afghanistan and have been involved in operations off the african coast as part of the operation enduring freedom .
british operations in afghanistan , as well as iraq , were used as justification for the bombings by the terror group . steps taken in immediate aftermath of blasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took steps in the immediate aftermath of the london bombings with the national railway operator bolstering security and berlin transport officials raising the alert level to " yellow . "
" we adapted our security concept in light of the current situation , " a spokesman for deutsche bahn told reuters .
the berlin transport authority reacted by adding more security personnel in the city 's underground system and train stations . police also boosted security at british and us installations in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , including a number of british military bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

adolf hitler 's regime blurred the line between the two , which led to a ruthless militarized police state . army deployment " highly dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily told a news conference that he believed it would be wrong to give the military any new role in preventing terror attacks .
" from a psychological point of view it would give the impression that we are in a permanent state of emergency and that is highly dangerous . " " we simply ca n't allow this .
we ca n't let the terrorists bring us to such a state , " he added . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- revealed a hard-line approach to terror in their election platform released on monday , four days after suspected islamist militants killed at least 52 people in four explosions on the london transport system . cdu outlines possible domestic roles for military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a section of the document entitled " a more forceful fight against terror , crime and vandalism , " the cdu maps out a plan to give the bundeswehr , germany 's army , expanded rights to defend the country against terrorist threats .
current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .

" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .
both have troops deployed in iraq . while germany may consider itself to be less of a target due to its non-involvement in iraq , german troops have been active in afghanistan and have been involved in operations off the african coast as part of the operation enduring freedom .

the berlin transport authority reacted by adding more security personnel in the city 's underground system and train stations . police also boosted security at british and us installations in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , including a number of british military bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that . " learning from the past spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso , who proposed the meeting based on lessons his country had learned after the attacks on trains in madrid in march last year , said it was important to seize the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london and madrid share painful experiences of train explosions like the madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , last thursday 's attacks on a london bus and three underground trains are also being blamed on islamic extremists . " it is a question of giving a political impulse to some issues .
europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy . " what our british friends expect now more than anything today is that we take decisions to reinforce our fight against terrorism because we have not attained the objectives we set ourselves a year ago , " he told the ministers . controlling borders and telecommunications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action is more important than sympathy : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy sarkozy said equipment had to be developed to allow the taking of fingerprints of all people seeking visas within the schengen open border zone , and backed britain on a law giving police access to telecommunications data . " the framework decision on the retention of electronic data must be adopted as a matter of urgency , " said sarkozy . french justice minister pascal clement added that the legislation would be " an extremely useful instrument for investigations into terrorism . " the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .

washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

" unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 a passion for space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for blast-off nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .
dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 fischer a lean , mean campaigning machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer through thick and thin after a german newspaper announced that the foreign minister was " too fat for the campaign , " joshka fischer has decided to whip himself into shape .
again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .
with likely early elections just around the corner though , enough is enough - fischer has decided to go from flab to fab . pumping iron for the party ? some newspapers are reporting that , this time around , his diet is more or less a party directive .
apparently , it 's easier to win female voters ' hearts with a washboard stomach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl - bigger than life ?
if those reports are true , the green party is probably overreacting .
fisher is not running for best male model , after all .
not to mention that the former german chancellor helmut kohl , whom fischer once described as a " 300-pound piece of meaty german history , " did not go on a diet before he reunified east and west germany in 1990 . on the other hand , look at what happened to angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
two years ago , she had a berlin celebrity stylist run his magic fingers through her infamously dull hair .
today , merkel is running for chancellor .
ugly ducklings are definitely out . having vowed to return to his " fighting weight " in time for the polls , fischer is on a roll .
he 's lost 10 kg since may and is planning to continue with a punishing exercising regimen and diet of steamed fish and fruit . the fashion police observing the upcoming german elections will have a tough call to make .
who wins the prize for the makeover of the decade ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is fischer too fat to fight ?
german foreign minister joschka fischer is his green party 's frontrunner in the upcoming elections .
but some worry that he might not be up to the stress of a gruelling campaign .

" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .
with likely early elections just around the corner though , enough is enough - fischer has decided to go from flab to fab . pumping iron for the party ? some newspapers are reporting that , this time around , his diet is more or less a party directive .
apparently , it 's easier to win female voters ' hearts with a washboard stomach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl - bigger than life ?
if those reports are true , the green party is probably overreacting .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .
with likely early elections just around the corner though , enough is enough - fischer has decided to go from flab to fab . pumping iron for the party ? some newspapers are reporting that , this time around , his diet is more or less a party directive .
apparently , it 's easier to win female voters ' hearts with a washboard stomach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl - bigger than life ?
if those reports are true , the green party is probably overreacting .
fisher is not running for best male model , after all .
not to mention that the former german chancellor helmut kohl , whom fischer once described as a " 300-pound piece of meaty german history , " did not go on a diet before he reunified east and west germany in 1990 . on the other hand , look at what happened to angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
two years ago , she had a berlin celebrity stylist run his magic fingers through her infamously dull hair .
today , merkel is running for chancellor .
ugly ducklings are definitely out . having vowed to return to his " fighting weight " in time for the polls , fischer is on a roll .
he 's lost 10 kg since may and is planning to continue with a punishing exercising regimen and diet of steamed fish and fruit . the fashion police observing the upcoming german elections will have a tough call to make .
who wins the prize for the makeover of the decade ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is fischer too fat to fight ?
german foreign minister joschka fischer is his green party 's frontrunner in the upcoming elections .
but some worry that he might not be up to the stress of a gruelling campaign .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .

" the fact is that tourists bring money to the island , whether they are there for two weeks or six months .
there is a minority group which complains about how expensive the island has become , but such criticism stuns me because everyone in mallorca benefits from the upturn the germans have facilitated .
there are international schools , better roads and hospitals , and they are there for everyone on the island , not just the germans , " she said . just keep on smiling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buyers get more for their money inland that is little consolation to young spaniards whose salaries have risen at less than quarter of the rate of house prices over the past few years .
but even as they struggle to buy their dream home in their home country , the spaniards are aware that they have the eu to thank for the new level of affluence in the nation . even anita garcia concedes that spain does n't wish to witness a return to its more barren pre-eu days .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .

none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .

-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .
at least 52 people died , although some reports have said the final toll could approach 70 as police continue to search the wreckage of one of the trains in a tunnel deep under london . fighting the problem at the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in prime minister tony blair 's weekly question time in parliament , he announced a plan to uproot the problem of religious extremism .
ministers will begin consultations on planned counter-terrorism legislation within the next couple of weeks , blair said .
prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .

adolf hitler 's regime blurred the line between the two , which led to a ruthless militarized police state . army deployment " highly dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily told a news conference that he believed it would be wrong to give the military any new role in preventing terror attacks .
" from a psychological point of view it would give the impression that we are in a permanent state of emergency and that is highly dangerous . " " we simply ca n't allow this .
we ca n't let the terrorists bring us to such a state , " he added . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- revealed a hard-line approach to terror in their election platform released on monday , four days after suspected islamist militants killed at least 52 people in four explosions on the london transport system . cdu outlines possible domestic roles for military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a section of the document entitled " a more forceful fight against terror , crime and vandalism , " the cdu maps out a plan to give the bundeswehr , germany 's army , expanded rights to defend the country against terrorist threats .
current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .
" if the cdu and csu are already thinking of using the army for security during the world cup in 2006 , then they are harming the entire police profession , " wolfgang speck , head of the police union , said . bosbach advocates bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach fended off the criticism and said his party would push for a change to the constitution .
" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .
both have troops deployed in iraq . while germany may consider itself to be less of a target due to its non-involvement in iraq , german troops have been active in afghanistan and have been involved in operations off the african coast as part of the operation enduring freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 a passion for space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for blast-off nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .
dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that . " learning from the past spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso , who proposed the meeting based on lessons his country had learned after the attacks on trains in madrid in march last year , said it was important to seize the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london and madrid share painful experiences of train explosions like the madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , last thursday 's attacks on a london bus and three underground trains are also being blamed on islamic extremists . " it is a question of giving a political impulse to some issues .
europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .

two years ago , she had a berlin celebrity stylist run his magic fingers through her infamously dull hair .
today , merkel is running for chancellor .
ugly ducklings are definitely out . having vowed to return to his " fighting weight " in time for the polls , fischer is on a roll .
he 's lost 10 kg since may and is planning to continue with a punishing exercising regimen and diet of steamed fish and fruit . the fashion police observing the upcoming german elections will have a tough call to make .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said .

europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy . " what our british friends expect now more than anything today is that we take decisions to reinforce our fight against terrorism because we have not attained the objectives we set ourselves a year ago , " he told the ministers . controlling borders and telecommunications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action is more important than sympathy : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy sarkozy said equipment had to be developed to allow the taking of fingerprints of all people seeking visas within the schengen open border zone , and backed britain on a law giving police access to telecommunications data . " the framework decision on the retention of electronic data must be adopted as a matter of urgency , " said sarkozy . french justice minister pascal clement added that the legislation would be " an extremely useful instrument for investigations into terrorism . " the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .

" the eu has a weight and authority ... we need to make sure everybody in the eu at a high level is working on these questions , and not everybody is and that 's what we have to achieve , " clarke said earlier on wednesday . " unless we succeed ... the people of europe will say that you , the european union , have let us down in these key areas , " he said . tighter security in britain , raids in italy as the interior ministers met in brussels , british prime minister tony blair in london told parliament his government would consider tougher action against people who incite or instigate terrorism , including tighter entry procedures , as well as try to promote moderate islam at home and abroad . meanwhile in italy , hundreds of police swept into islamic communities across the country raiding dozens of homes , carrying out identity checks and seizing material . no arrests were announced several hours into the operation , which began in the morning in cities including turin , florence , bologna , rome and naples . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe beefed up security on thursday following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2005 news of homegrown bombers shocks uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have uncovered disturbing evidence concerning the bombers police in britain are hunting for a mastermind behind the london bombings that they believe directed the four suspected attackers - muslims of pakistani origin - at least three of whom were born and raised in britain . british authorities said they were hunting wednesday for the masterminds of last week 's bombings in london amid shock over the news that the attacks were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .
his driving permit and other personal effects were reported found in the remains of the bus . police gained vital clues from hussain 's parents , who knew their son was in london and were unable to contact him by phone once the bombs went off , the times said .
none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .
it does not , in any way , close this case , " the times said in an editorial .
" is it really possible that no one beyond the bombers had any inkling of their intentions ? " it asked .
the guardian , for its part , described news that the bombers were british as " the worst of all possible outcomes . ...
it will have been the work of people brought up in our multi-racial society of which policy-makers were rightly proud .
this is not just a challenge for government but for civic society , too . "
the bombs on the london underground trains - near the aldgate , edgware road and king 's cross stations - went off at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .
at least 52 people died , although some reports have said the final toll could approach 70 as police continue to search the wreckage of one of the trains in a tunnel deep under london . fighting the problem at the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in prime minister tony blair 's weekly question time in parliament , he announced a plan to uproot the problem of religious extremism .
ministers will begin consultations on planned counter-terrorism legislation within the next couple of weeks , blair said .
prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .
the prime minister also said his government would begin talks immediately with british muslim leaders about combating the " poisonous and perverted misinterpretation of the religion of islam " by mobilizing moderate opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigation of london bombings heats up british police declared their first arrest tuesday in connection with the london bombings and said at least one bomber is confirmed to have been killed as the pieces began to fall together in a fast-moving probe .

british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .

after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .

" unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .

-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.07.2005 news of homegrown bombers shocks uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have uncovered disturbing evidence concerning the bombers police in britain are hunting for a mastermind behind the london bombings that they believe directed the four suspected attackers - muslims of pakistani origin - at least three of whom were born and raised in britain . british authorities said they were hunting wednesday for the masterminds of last week 's bombings in london amid shock over the news that the attacks were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .
his driving permit and other personal effects were reported found in the remains of the bus . police gained vital clues from hussain 's parents , who knew their son was in london and were unable to contact him by phone once the bombs went off , the times said .
none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .
it does not , in any way , close this case , " the times said in an editorial .
" is it really possible that no one beyond the bombers had any inkling of their intentions ? " it asked .
the guardian , for its part , described news that the bombers were british as " the worst of all possible outcomes . ...
it will have been the work of people brought up in our multi-racial society of which policy-makers were rightly proud .
this is not just a challenge for government but for civic society , too . "
the bombs on the london underground trains - near the aldgate , edgware road and king 's cross stations - went off at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .
at least 52 people died , although some reports have said the final toll could approach 70 as police continue to search the wreckage of one of the trains in a tunnel deep under london . fighting the problem at the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in prime minister tony blair 's weekly question time in parliament , he announced a plan to uproot the problem of religious extremism .
ministers will begin consultations on planned counter-terrorism legislation within the next couple of weeks , blair said .
prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .
the prime minister also said his government would begin talks immediately with british muslim leaders about combating the " poisonous and perverted misinterpretation of the religion of islam " by mobilizing moderate opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigation of london bombings heats up british police declared their first arrest tuesday in connection with the london bombings and said at least one bomber is confirmed to have been killed as the pieces began to fall together in a fast-moving probe .

current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .

" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that . " learning from the past spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso , who proposed the meeting based on lessons his country had learned after the attacks on trains in madrid in march last year , said it was important to seize the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london and madrid share painful experiences of train explosions like the madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , last thursday 's attacks on a london bus and three underground trains are also being blamed on islamic extremists . " it is a question of giving a political impulse to some issues .
europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy . " what our british friends expect now more than anything today is that we take decisions to reinforce our fight against terrorism because we have not attained the objectives we set ourselves a year ago , " he told the ministers . controlling borders and telecommunications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action is more important than sympathy : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy sarkozy said equipment had to be developed to allow the taking of fingerprints of all people seeking visas within the schengen open border zone , and backed britain on a law giving police access to telecommunications data . " the framework decision on the retention of electronic data must be adopted as a matter of urgency , " said sarkozy . french justice minister pascal clement added that the legislation would be " an extremely useful instrument for investigations into terrorism . " the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .
they committed to improving police cooperation and information sharing , finding out what makes people turn to terror , and revising shipping and aviation security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pushing for common security standards in europe : british home secretary charles clarke clarke has also called for the eu 's 25 member states to agree common standards for security feature on identity cards , as well as rules to combat terror financing . " the eu has a weight and authority ... we need to make sure everybody in the eu at a high level is working on these questions , and not everybody is and that 's what we have to achieve , " clarke said earlier on wednesday . " unless we succeed ... the people of europe will say that you , the european union , have let us down in these key areas , " he said . tighter security in britain , raids in italy as the interior ministers met in brussels , british prime minister tony blair in london told parliament his government would consider tougher action against people who incite or instigate terrorism , including tighter entry procedures , as well as try to promote moderate islam at home and abroad . meanwhile in italy , hundreds of police swept into islamic communities across the country raiding dozens of homes , carrying out identity checks and seizing material . no arrests were announced several hours into the operation , which began in the morning in cities including turin , florence , bologna , rome and naples . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe beefed up security on thursday following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 us rejects berlin 's un bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's permanent security council seat is looking unlikely the united states has rejected a draft resolution by brazil , germany , india and japan seeking enlargement of the united nations security council .
washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .
the proposals would then pass to national legislatures for final endorsement .
and here , the five permanent members - china , france , britain , the us and russia - have the power of veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration flatly rejects the g-4 resolution germany 's un envoy gunter pleuger dismissed fears that the g-4 text would be vetoed by some of the council 's big five . " once our proposal is adopted by more than two-thirds of the whole un membership , the opponents of this resolution will be faced with the question : do one or two permanent members really want to block ... a change for the better of the whole un organization ?
do they want to be seen in worldwide public opinion as those who deny the developing countries representation in the council on an equal footing - as permanent members ? , " he said . tokyo remains optimistic foreign ministers of the g-4 will travel to new york this weekend for a final meeting and , although no ballot on the resolution has been scheduled , japan says it hopes for a vote later this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the japanese bid just a pie in the sky dream ?
tokyo has vowed to continue pushing for the expansion to 25 seats and says it still holds out hope of success .
speaking at a press conference , chief cabinet secretary hiroyuki hosada said " many developments are possible , so at this time we do n't believe the us way of thinking is fixed .
like other nations , we would like to have it decided soon .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- feedback should the g-4 countries , and specificially germany , be given permanent security council seats ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 us rejects berlin 's un bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's permanent security council seat is looking unlikely the united states has rejected a draft resolution by brazil , germany , india and japan seeking enlargement of the united nations security council .
washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .
the proposals would then pass to national legislatures for final endorsement .
and here , the five permanent members - china , france , britain , the us and russia - have the power of veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration flatly rejects the g-4 resolution germany 's un envoy gunter pleuger dismissed fears that the g-4 text would be vetoed by some of the council 's big five . " once our proposal is adopted by more than two-thirds of the whole un membership , the opponents of this resolution will be faced with the question : do one or two permanent members really want to block ... a change for the better of the whole un organization ?
do they want to be seen in worldwide public opinion as those who deny the developing countries representation in the council on an equal footing - as permanent members ? , " he said . tokyo remains optimistic foreign ministers of the g-4 will travel to new york this weekend for a final meeting and , although no ballot on the resolution has been scheduled , japan says it hopes for a vote later this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the japanese bid just a pie in the sky dream ?
tokyo has vowed to continue pushing for the expansion to 25 seats and says it still holds out hope of success .
speaking at a press conference , chief cabinet secretary hiroyuki hosada said " many developments are possible , so at this time we do n't believe the us way of thinking is fixed .
like other nations , we would like to have it decided soon .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday .

again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that . " learning from the past spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso , who proposed the meeting based on lessons his country had learned after the attacks on trains in madrid in march last year , said it was important to seize the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london and madrid share painful experiences of train explosions like the madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , last thursday 's attacks on a london bus and three underground trains are also being blamed on islamic extremists . " it is a question of giving a political impulse to some issues .
europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy .

" the framework decision on the retention of electronic data must be adopted as a matter of urgency , " said sarkozy . french justice minister pascal clement added that the legislation would be " an extremely useful instrument for investigations into terrorism . " the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .
they committed to improving police cooperation and information sharing , finding out what makes people turn to terror , and revising shipping and aviation security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pushing for common security standards in europe : british home secretary charles clarke clarke has also called for the eu 's 25 member states to agree common standards for security feature on identity cards , as well as rules to combat terror financing . " the eu has a weight and authority ... we need to make sure everybody in the eu at a high level is working on these questions , and not everybody is and that 's what we have to achieve , " clarke said earlier on wednesday . " unless we succeed ... the people of europe will say that you , the european union , have let us down in these key areas , " he said . tighter security in britain , raids in italy as the interior ministers met in brussels , british prime minister tony blair in london told parliament his government would consider tougher action against people who incite or instigate terrorism , including tighter entry procedures , as well as try to promote moderate islam at home and abroad . meanwhile in italy , hundreds of police swept into islamic communities across the country raiding dozens of homes , carrying out identity checks and seizing material . no arrests were announced several hours into the operation , which began in the morning in cities including turin , florence , bologna , rome and naples . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe beefed up security on thursday following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

" essentially people are looking for a different way of life .
they are no longer satisfied with a two-week package holiday , but want somewhere they can go four or five times a year , " she said .
" it 's attractive for young couples with children .
they can be outside all the time , and it 's an infinitely better way to live . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular spot near valencia but how good is it for local communities ?
thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .
" we can live side by side , but sometimes it 's a bit galling when you go to a local café and have to order your coffee in english , " garcia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love their mallorcan sangria she also laments what is known as the " german invasion " on the island of mallorca , which she says has completely changed the face of the place . but heidi stadler , who has run a real estate agency on the island for the past decade , believes that locals have gained more than they 've lost through the prolific german presence there . " the fact is that tourists bring money to the island , whether they are there for two weeks or six months .
there is a minority group which complains about how expensive the island has become , but such criticism stuns me because everyone in mallorca benefits from the upturn the germans have facilitated .
there are international schools , better roads and hospitals , and they are there for everyone on the island , not just the germans , " she said . just keep on smiling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buyers get more for their money inland that is little consolation to young spaniards whose salaries have risen at less than quarter of the rate of house prices over the past few years .
but even as they struggle to buy their dream home in their home country , the spaniards are aware that they have the eu to thank for the new level of affluence in the nation . even anita garcia concedes that spain does n't wish to witness a return to its more barren pre-eu days .
" spain wo n't bite the hand that feeds it , and will ultimately agree to go along with anything to remain in the european fold , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german construction flourishes abroad german construction companies are having a tough time at home , and after walter bau filed for bankruptcy earlier this week more firms are looking to for profits outside of germany - where business is booming .

now , for the first time in a german-speaking country , the work of francisco de goya is on impressive display in berlin . the artist sprawls in a slumber across his table , while behind his back demonic animals rise above him .
the etching , entitled " the sleep of reason produces monsters " , is a self portrait and forms part of what is probably goya 's best-known series of eight plates , designed as a criticism of " human errors and vices . " it was images like this that moved the organizers of the berlin show to try and stage it in the first place .
and the process has been arduous .
it has taken more than 10 years to bring goya to berlin , where he is now the protagonist of a high-profile exhibition called " goya : prophet of the modern . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a catalogue of twisted images curator moritz wullen says goya was a century ahead of his time , experimenting with symbolism , expressionism and surrealism and thus triggering the " original explosion of modernism . " limited visitor capacity berlin is hoping that the show 's uniqueness will pull crowds in the same volume as the new york museum of modern art exhibition staged in berlin last year .
more than a million visitors came to see the moma collection , bringing 6.5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.8 million -rrb- with them . city hotels are doing their bit to drum up interest for the spanish master , with special offers combining accommodation , entry into the gallery and a catalogue , and private bus companies are offering special trips to the berlin gallery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , flight of the witches 1797/98 wullen is a little surprised at the level of interest and has expressed his reservations about trying to repeat the successful moma show , for reasons of space , if nothing else .
the gallery is comparably small and would struggle to accommodate 1,000 visitors an hour .
" the pictures would fall off the walls , " wullen said . while thronging crowds are a daunting prospect , wullen said he can understand the interest , as it is only now that goya can really begin to be understood . he said it takes modern eyes fed on a diet of horror films to comprehend the artist 's apocalyptic visions of sorcerers and double-faced ghosts .
" if goya had lived two hundred years later , he would have been making films , " wullen said . colorful past but during his lifetime spanning 1746 - 1828 , goya was the son of an artisan , and earned his crust by painting portraits , idyllic country parties and still-life compositions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : francisco de goya , the parasol 1777 the quality of his work made him much sought after and he enjoyed a varied and colorful career which included his appointment to the position of first court painter to charles iv in 1799 . by then however , the painter had been left deaf by a mysterious illness .
it was an affliction which was to change his life and his work , giving rise to the dark exploration of social and psychological themes for which he became so well-known . the goya exhibition runs at berlin 's alte nationalgalerie until october 3 . kerstin hilt / dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the party 's over - life after moma in a city reeling from sweeping cuts to the arts , moma 's overwhelming success marks a new twist in berlin 's ongoing culture wars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 a passion for space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for blast-off nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .
dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .

adolf hitler 's regime blurred the line between the two , which led to a ruthless militarized police state . army deployment " highly dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily told a news conference that he believed it would be wrong to give the military any new role in preventing terror attacks .
" from a psychological point of view it would give the impression that we are in a permanent state of emergency and that is highly dangerous . " " we simply ca n't allow this .
we ca n't let the terrorists bring us to such a state , " he added . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- revealed a hard-line approach to terror in their election platform released on monday , four days after suspected islamist militants killed at least 52 people in four explosions on the london transport system . cdu outlines possible domestic roles for military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a section of the document entitled " a more forceful fight against terror , crime and vandalism , " the cdu maps out a plan to give the bundeswehr , germany 's army , expanded rights to defend the country against terrorist threats .
current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .
" if the cdu and csu are already thinking of using the army for security during the world cup in 2006 , then they are harming the entire police profession , " wolfgang speck , head of the police union , said . bosbach advocates bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach fended off the criticism and said his party would push for a change to the constitution .
" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .
both have troops deployed in iraq . while germany may consider itself to be less of a target due to its non-involvement in iraq , german troops have been active in afghanistan and have been involved in operations off the african coast as part of the operation enduring freedom .
british operations in afghanistan , as well as iraq , were used as justification for the bombings by the terror group . steps taken in immediate aftermath of blasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took steps in the immediate aftermath of the london bombings with the national railway operator bolstering security and berlin transport officials raising the alert level to " yellow . "
" we adapted our security concept in light of the current situation , " a spokesman for deutsche bahn told reuters .
the berlin transport authority reacted by adding more security personnel in the city 's underground system and train stations . police also boosted security at british and us installations in north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , including a number of british military bases . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german in-fighting threatens eu terror initiatives european investigators have called for more efficient cooperation in the fight against terrorism .

" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size .

washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .
the proposals would then pass to national legislatures for final endorsement .

" once our proposal is adopted by more than two-thirds of the whole un membership , the opponents of this resolution will be faced with the question : do one or two permanent members really want to block ... a change for the better of the whole un organization ?
do they want to be seen in worldwide public opinion as those who deny the developing countries representation in the council on an equal footing - as permanent members ? , " he said . tokyo remains optimistic foreign ministers of the g-4 will travel to new york this weekend for a final meeting and , although no ballot on the resolution has been scheduled , japan says it hopes for a vote later this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the japanese bid just a pie in the sky dream ?
tokyo has vowed to continue pushing for the expansion to 25 seats and says it still holds out hope of success .

british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .

" unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .

spain 's , however , is soaring , thanks to the same german money that thwarts growth at home . decades after its emergence as a tourist hot spot , spain , with its sun-soaked costas , is leading the european pack both in terms of increasing house prices and construction levels .
in 2004 , more new properties went up in spain than were built in germany and the benelux countries combined .
that , even though the population of the country is just 40 million .
although spain has one of the highest rates of owner occupancy in europe , the number of new buildings - some 600,000 last year - far outstrips domestic demand . but then , they are not necessarily being built with the spaniards in mind .
au contraire .
many of the sparkling white apartment blocks which rage into the mediterranean sky are earmarked for foreigners from the outset .
the industry has been dubbed residential tourism , and its key players are the germans and brits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have opened the doors to a new way of life although the idea of having a second home in sunnier climes is not new , the trend is moving away from the traditional groups of pensioners . cheap air travel to an ever increasing number of destinations and the opportunities the internet offers for flexible working , combine to entice more and more young people to leave the cloudy confines of northern europe to both relax and work in the glory of the spanish sun . " infinitely better way to live " zoe hall of lighthouse real estate agents says there 's a whole new generation of people itching to live the good life . " essentially people are looking for a different way of life .
they are no longer satisfied with a two-week package holiday , but want somewhere they can go four or five times a year , " she said .
" it 's attractive for young couples with children .
they can be outside all the time , and it 's an infinitely better way to live . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular spot near valencia but how good is it for local communities ?
thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .

british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .
his driving permit and other personal effects were reported found in the remains of the bus . police gained vital clues from hussain 's parents , who knew their son was in london and were unable to contact him by phone once the bombs went off , the times said .
none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .
it does not , in any way , close this case , " the times said in an editorial .
" is it really possible that no one beyond the bombers had any inkling of their intentions ? " it asked .
the guardian , for its part , described news that the bombers were british as " the worst of all possible outcomes . ...
it will have been the work of people brought up in our multi-racial society of which policy-makers were rightly proud .
this is not just a challenge for government but for civic society , too . "
the bombs on the london underground trains - near the aldgate , edgware road and king 's cross stations - went off at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .

prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 us rejects berlin 's un bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's permanent security council seat is looking unlikely the united states has rejected a draft resolution by brazil , germany , india and japan seeking enlargement of the united nations security council .
washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .
the proposals would then pass to national legislatures for final endorsement .

washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .

" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size .

" ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .

and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
four of the permanent six would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries . reform process delayed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan calls for focus earlier un secretary general kofi annan called on members to overcome differences over the proposed council expansion and move forward on all aspects of un reform needed to make the organization more responsive to today 's challenges .
" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .
the proposals would then pass to national legislatures for final endorsement .
and here , the five permanent members - china , france , britain , the us and russia - have the power of veto . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration flatly rejects the g-4 resolution germany 's un envoy gunter pleuger dismissed fears that the g-4 text would be vetoed by some of the council 's big five . " once our proposal is adopted by more than two-thirds of the whole un membership , the opponents of this resolution will be faced with the question : do one or two permanent members really want to block ... a change for the better of the whole un organization ?
do they want to be seen in worldwide public opinion as those who deny the developing countries representation in the council on an equal footing - as permanent members ? , " he said . tokyo remains optimistic foreign ministers of the g-4 will travel to new york this weekend for a final meeting and , although no ballot on the resolution has been scheduled , japan says it hopes for a vote later this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the japanese bid just a pie in the sky dream ?
tokyo has vowed to continue pushing for the expansion to 25 seats and says it still holds out hope of success .
speaking at a press conference , chief cabinet secretary hiroyuki hosada said " many developments are possible , so at this time we do n't believe the us way of thinking is fixed .
like other nations , we would like to have it decided soon .

spain 's , however , is soaring , thanks to the same german money that thwarts growth at home . decades after its emergence as a tourist hot spot , spain , with its sun-soaked costas , is leading the european pack both in terms of increasing house prices and construction levels .
in 2004 , more new properties went up in spain than were built in germany and the benelux countries combined .
that , even though the population of the country is just 40 million .
although spain has one of the highest rates of owner occupancy in europe , the number of new buildings - some 600,000 last year - far outstrips domestic demand . but then , they are not necessarily being built with the spaniards in mind .
au contraire .
many of the sparkling white apartment blocks which rage into the mediterranean sky are earmarked for foreigners from the outset .
the industry has been dubbed residential tourism , and its key players are the germans and brits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have opened the doors to a new way of life although the idea of having a second home in sunnier climes is not new , the trend is moving away from the traditional groups of pensioners . cheap air travel to an ever increasing number of destinations and the opportunities the internet offers for flexible working , combine to entice more and more young people to leave the cloudy confines of northern europe to both relax and work in the glory of the spanish sun . " infinitely better way to live " zoe hall of lighthouse real estate agents says there 's a whole new generation of people itching to live the good life . " essentially people are looking for a different way of life .
they are no longer satisfied with a two-week package holiday , but want somewhere they can go four or five times a year , " she said .
" it 's attractive for young couples with children .
they can be outside all the time , and it 's an infinitely better way to live . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular spot near valencia but how good is it for local communities ?
thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .
" we can live side by side , but sometimes it 's a bit galling when you go to a local café and have to order your coffee in english , " garcia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love their mallorcan sangria she also laments what is known as the " german invasion " on the island of mallorca , which she says has completely changed the face of the place . but heidi stadler , who has run a real estate agency on the island for the past decade , believes that locals have gained more than they 've lost through the prolific german presence there . " the fact is that tourists bring money to the island , whether they are there for two weeks or six months .
there is a minority group which complains about how expensive the island has become , but such criticism stuns me because everyone in mallorca benefits from the upturn the germans have facilitated .
there are international schools , better roads and hospitals , and they are there for everyone on the island , not just the germans , " she said . just keep on smiling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buyers get more for their money inland that is little consolation to young spaniards whose salaries have risen at less than quarter of the rate of house prices over the past few years .
but even as they struggle to buy their dream home in their home country , the spaniards are aware that they have the eu to thank for the new level of affluence in the nation . even anita garcia concedes that spain does n't wish to witness a return to its more barren pre-eu days .
" spain wo n't bite the hand that feeds it , and will ultimately agree to go along with anything to remain in the european fold , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german construction flourishes abroad german construction companies are having a tough time at home , and after walter bau filed for bankruptcy earlier this week more firms are looking to for profits outside of germany - where business is booming .

" what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that .

" the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .
they committed to improving police cooperation and information sharing , finding out what makes people turn to terror , and revising shipping and aviation security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pushing for common security standards in europe : british home secretary charles clarke clarke has also called for the eu 's 25 member states to agree common standards for security feature on identity cards , as well as rules to combat terror financing .

" none of the proposals on our agenda are new , we were considering them in any case , " said british home secretary charles clarke as he opened the session at the eu council building in brussels , called in the wake of the london bombings which killed at least 52 people . with police expressing fears of further attacks in britain , clarke urged his eu counterparts to use the momentum to ensure swift passage of the laws . " what we have to do is accelerate and speed up our work to agreement , to ensure that we put in place , in practice , the measures which are needed to make the work of terrorism more difficult , " he said . " all of us today are determined to achieve that . " learning from the past spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso , who proposed the meeting based on lessons his country had learned after the attacks on trains in madrid in march last year , said it was important to seize the moment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london and madrid share painful experiences of train explosions like the madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , last thursday 's attacks on a london bus and three underground trains are also being blamed on islamic extremists . " it is a question of giving a political impulse to some issues .
europe 's security space has to be built up , independently of the crises that the european union is going through , " alonso said as he arrived . french interior minister nicolas sarkozy expressed solidarity with britain , but said london needed action more than sympathy . " what our british friends expect now more than anything today is that we take decisions to reinforce our fight against terrorism because we have not attained the objectives we set ourselves a year ago , " he told the ministers . controlling borders and telecommunications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : action is more important than sympathy : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy sarkozy said equipment had to be developed to allow the taking of fingerprints of all people seeking visas within the schengen open border zone , and backed britain on a law giving police access to telecommunications data . " the framework decision on the retention of electronic data must be adopted as a matter of urgency , " said sarkozy . french justice minister pascal clement added that the legislation would be " an extremely useful instrument for investigations into terrorism . " the measure could see data from telephones - including mobiles , text messages and landlines - and internet information like e-mail kept for at least a year , for crime fighting purposes . sharing information is essential the ministers met for around three hours and issued a declaration jointly condemning the bombings and pledging to step up the fight against terrorism .
they committed to improving police cooperation and information sharing , finding out what makes people turn to terror , and revising shipping and aviation security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pushing for common security standards in europe : british home secretary charles clarke clarke has also called for the eu 's 25 member states to agree common standards for security feature on identity cards , as well as rules to combat terror financing . " the eu has a weight and authority ... we need to make sure everybody in the eu at a high level is working on these questions , and not everybody is and that 's what we have to achieve , " clarke said earlier on wednesday .

adolf hitler 's regime blurred the line between the two , which led to a ruthless militarized police state . army deployment " highly dangerous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schily told a news conference that he believed it would be wrong to give the military any new role in preventing terror attacks .
" from a psychological point of view it would give the impression that we are in a permanent state of emergency and that is highly dangerous . " " we simply ca n't allow this .
we ca n't let the terrorists bring us to such a state , " he added . the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- revealed a hard-line approach to terror in their election platform released on monday , four days after suspected islamist militants killed at least 52 people in four explosions on the london transport system . cdu outlines possible domestic roles for military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a section of the document entitled " a more forceful fight against terror , crime and vandalism , " the cdu maps out a plan to give the bundeswehr , germany 's army , expanded rights to defend the country against terrorist threats .
current legislation stipulates that the armed forces only be used domestically in exceptional circumstances and both houses of parliament have the power to stop their deployment . " the army can already offer help in special cases , " schily said in reference to a law passed earlier this year that gives the country 's defense minister the right to order hijacked aircraft be shot down .
" but you ca n't simply give them brand new tasks .
the army has military , not police responsibilities . " german police officials are concerned that a cdu / csu plan involving the military would undermine the law enforcement agencies currently engaged in the prevention of terrorism .
" if the cdu and csu are already thinking of using the army for security during the world cup in 2006 , then they are harming the entire police profession , " wolfgang speck , head of the police union , said . bosbach advocates bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , the cdu 's wolfgang bosbach fended off the criticism and said his party would push for a change to the constitution .
" we want to use the capacities of the bundeswehr on a domestic basis when we need them to defend against a terrorist threat , " said bosbach , who is seen by some as a potential successor to schily if the conservatives are victorious in a coming election . he continued by outlining four specific threat scenarios in which the conservatives would deploy the military domestically : attacks from the air , attacks from the sea , attacks using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons , and attacks on infrastructure that the police were not able to defend against . the conservatives have also called for more extensive sharing of information between the secret services and police , a move which schily said could dissuade foreign countries from passing on intelligence to germany . germany cautioned over state of false security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts and commentators on terror have warned germany to be vigilant despite not being mentioned in statements by those claiming responsibility for the london bombings , the so-called secret organization of al qaeda in europe . the group , which also claimed responsibility for the last major terror attack in europe - a string of bombs that hit commuter trains in madrid , spain , in march 2004 , killing 191 people - warned the governments of italy and denmark that their countries could be next .
both have troops deployed in iraq . while germany may consider itself to be less of a target due to its non-involvement in iraq , german troops have been active in afghanistan and have been involved in operations off the african coast as part of the operation enduring freedom .
british operations in afghanistan , as well as iraq , were used as justification for the bombings by the terror group . steps taken in immediate aftermath of blasts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany took steps in the immediate aftermath of the london bombings with the national railway operator bolstering security and berlin transport officials raising the alert level to " yellow .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.07.2005 fischer a lean , mean campaigning machine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer through thick and thin after a german newspaper announced that the foreign minister was " too fat for the campaign , " joshka fischer has decided to whip himself into shape .
again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .
with likely early elections just around the corner though , enough is enough - fischer has decided to go from flab to fab . pumping iron for the party ? some newspapers are reporting that , this time around , his diet is more or less a party directive .
apparently , it 's easier to win female voters ' hearts with a washboard stomach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl - bigger than life ?
if those reports are true , the green party is probably overreacting .
fisher is not running for best male model , after all .
not to mention that the former german chancellor helmut kohl , whom fischer once described as a " 300-pound piece of meaty german history , " did not go on a diet before he reunified east and west germany in 1990 . on the other hand , look at what happened to angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
two years ago , she had a berlin celebrity stylist run his magic fingers through her infamously dull hair .
today , merkel is running for chancellor .
ugly ducklings are definitely out . having vowed to return to his " fighting weight " in time for the polls , fischer is on a roll .
he 's lost 10 kg since may and is planning to continue with a punishing exercising regimen and diet of steamed fish and fruit . the fashion police observing the upcoming german elections will have a tough call to make .
who wins the prize for the makeover of the decade ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is fischer too fat to fight ?

again . it 's a never-ending story with joshka .
in the same way he went from high-school drop-out and rebellious street-fighter to green party bigwig and respected foreign minister , the man has radically changed his shape over the years , yo-yo-ing up and down the scales at a rate that would make even oprah winfrey dizzy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer in his thinner days in his first startling transformation back in 1997 , joschka became a dedicated runner , whittling off a whopping 37 kg -lrb- 82 lbs -rrb- , and writing a book , " my long run to myself , " which immediately became a bestseller . but over the last two years , he has regained at least 20kg of his old baggage .
with likely early elections just around the corner though , enough is enough - fischer has decided to go from flab to fab . pumping iron for the party ? some newspapers are reporting that , this time around , his diet is more or less a party directive .
apparently , it 's easier to win female voters ' hearts with a washboard stomach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl - bigger than life ?
if those reports are true , the green party is probably overreacting .
fisher is not running for best male model , after all .
not to mention that the former german chancellor helmut kohl , whom fischer once described as a " 300-pound piece of meaty german history , " did not go on a diet before he reunified east and west germany in 1990 . on the other hand , look at what happened to angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
two years ago , she had a berlin celebrity stylist run his magic fingers through her infamously dull hair .
today , merkel is running for chancellor .
ugly ducklings are definitely out . having vowed to return to his " fighting weight " in time for the polls , fischer is on a roll .
he 's lost 10 kg since may and is planning to continue with a punishing exercising regimen and diet of steamed fish and fruit . the fashion police observing the upcoming german elections will have a tough call to make .

dw-world spoke to former german astronaut ulrich walter about the dangers of space travel . dw-world : just how dangerous is modern space travel ? space travel is not without its dangers .
the shuttle is the most complex ever piece of man-made machinery , and the problem is that we are at the limits of the materials used .
there are no better material and we just have to live with that . which training strategies are used to help astronauts overcome possible fears ? let 's call them concerns rather than fears .
i think every astronaut is concerned that something might go wrong during his mission , perhaps even something fatal .
fear stuns you so you don ’ t know what to do .
but every astronaut is extremely well prepared to deal with dangerous situations , and that removes the fear , leaving only the concern behind . exactly what are you trained to do ? to understand the psychology of dealing with risks .
nasa trains its people for such situations , which i think is quite right .
more than 50 percent of the training focuses on unlikely situations , which nasa calls " off-nominals . " can you give an example of an extreme training situation you experienced ? the simulation of the shuttle bursting into flames at the beginning .
that would be a critically dangerous situation , requiring that you evacuate the shuttle as quickly as possible .
high up , to the side of the launching pad , there are baskets which you have to climb inside and then you slide about a kilometer down a rope and drive away with a little tank .
and we trained for that very situation on the launching pad . do you remember the feeling before your launch in columbia ? very well .
i will remember that for the rest of my life .
i felt tense yet happy and relaxed .
you do n't know exactly what is going to happen , so you just have to go with it .
if something goes wrong , there 's not much you can do about it .
but on the other hand , it 's pretty impressive . do you have dreams at that moment ? no , none at all .
it has nothing to do with dreaming , but is in fact much more a case of breathing in the reality even deeper than normal .
you look at everything very clearly .
i told myself , " you 've been working for this for the past five years , now you 're going aboard . "
you are concentrated on what is about to happen , and that is captivating . does the long , hard work pay off ? the pay-off is in the flight itself , rather than just the take-off .
and it is also being able to do science in space .
we are scientific astronauts , which means we 're not only interested in the view from the window , but the fact that we can really do something for which we were trained .
that provides a great sense of satisfaction . would you go back into space ? at the drop of a hat ! are you envious of the discovery astronauts ? yes .
every astronaut loves space travel .
i do n't know a single astronaut who would not join the discovery team . and how do you bid your family farewell ? on the eve of a launch , there is what 's known as the nightview , where people gather in front of the shuttle on the streets that lead to the launch pad .
on one side are the astronauts , who are kept in quarantine conditions , and on the other side , the family with the children .
they wave at each other and shout across to each other a bit .
it is a little sad , because the little children want to go to their fathers , but they 're not allowed .
it 's a really strange situation because the shuttle is lit up in the darkness .
it 's a very , very impressive farewell . tina gerhäuser interviewed ulrich walter , now a professor of aerospace technology at munich 's technical university -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's super rocket takes off europe 's ariane 5 super-rocket lifted off saturday from kourou , french guiana and placed into orbit two satellites more than two years after the first version of the launcher failed spectacularly .

washington said the proposal did not enjoy broad-based support . the united states joined a number of countries , including pakistan , algeria , argentina , canada and new zealand , in slamming the g-4 text , which calls for the enlargement of the council from 15 members to 25 . shirin tahir-kheli a senior advisor to us secretary of state , condoleezza rice assured the 191 un members that washington was willing to work towards enlarging the security council , " but only in the right way and at the right time . "
and as that time is not now , he urged the general assembly to " oppose this resolution and should it come to a vote , to vote against it . " germany and the other three members of the g-4 group have been calling for the addition of six permanent seats without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .

" i hope the member states will sort themselves out and become very focused on the task at hand , " he said . washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
russian ambassador andrei denisov warned that making the council more representative must not be allowed to " undermine its effectiveness , " adding that an expanded body " should not exceed a reasonable size . " and he reiterated moscow 's view that " any dilution of the status of the five current permanent members of the security council , first of all the veto right , is categorically unacceptable . " ancient balance of power as it is , the security council still represents the balance of power from 1945 , hence the g-4 's calls for an updated model .
in order to get the ball rolling , the general assembly would need to approve the resolution with a two-thirds majority .
but that is not all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.07.2005 residential tourists flood spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a home in the sun is a dream come true for many germans plagued by economic woes , germany 's real estate market is one of the most stagnant on the continent .
spain 's , however , is soaring , thanks to the same german money that thwarts growth at home . decades after its emergence as a tourist hot spot , spain , with its sun-soaked costas , is leading the european pack both in terms of increasing house prices and construction levels .
in 2004 , more new properties went up in spain than were built in germany and the benelux countries combined .
that , even though the population of the country is just 40 million .
although spain has one of the highest rates of owner occupancy in europe , the number of new buildings - some 600,000 last year - far outstrips domestic demand . but then , they are not necessarily being built with the spaniards in mind .
au contraire .
many of the sparkling white apartment blocks which rage into the mediterranean sky are earmarked for foreigners from the outset .
the industry has been dubbed residential tourism , and its key players are the germans and brits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap airlines have opened the doors to a new way of life although the idea of having a second home in sunnier climes is not new , the trend is moving away from the traditional groups of pensioners . cheap air travel to an ever increasing number of destinations and the opportunities the internet offers for flexible working , combine to entice more and more young people to leave the cloudy confines of northern europe to both relax and work in the glory of the spanish sun . " infinitely better way to live " zoe hall of lighthouse real estate agents says there 's a whole new generation of people itching to live the good life . " essentially people are looking for a different way of life .
they are no longer satisfied with a two-week package holiday , but want somewhere they can go four or five times a year , " she said .
" it 's attractive for young couples with children .
they can be outside all the time , and it 's an infinitely better way to live . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular spot near valencia but how good is it for local communities ?
thus far the tourist populace has been concentrated on a few stretches of coast .
but , in recent times , the residential sun-seekers have been moving further inward , taking advantage of greater accessibility to inland rural spain and places such as the costa de la luz , which are still relatively cheap and unspoilt . unlike the coastal regions , buying inland requires a genuine dedication to the spanish way of life .
" you really have to make an effort to be accepted , " says zoe hall .
" but inland communities are much warmer , especially if you can speak spanish . " the language factor unfortunately that is a prerequisite which the majority of foreigners living or holidaying in spain do not fulfill , and it makes it harder for the local population to accept this new wave of strange neighbors . anita garcia lives in the hills behind the front line of the costa brava and is no stranger to sharing her turf with outsiders .
" we can live side by side , but sometimes it 's a bit galling when you go to a local café and have to order your coffee in english , " garcia said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love their mallorcan sangria she also laments what is known as the " german invasion " on the island of mallorca , which she says has completely changed the face of the place . but heidi stadler , who has run a real estate agency on the island for the past decade , believes that locals have gained more than they 've lost through the prolific german presence there . " the fact is that tourists bring money to the island , whether they are there for two weeks or six months .
there is a minority group which complains about how expensive the island has become , but such criticism stuns me because everyone in mallorca benefits from the upturn the germans have facilitated .
there are international schools , better roads and hospitals , and they are there for everyone on the island , not just the germans , " she said . just keep on smiling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buyers get more for their money inland that is little consolation to young spaniards whose salaries have risen at less than quarter of the rate of house prices over the past few years .
but even as they struggle to buy their dream home in their home country , the spaniards are aware that they have the eu to thank for the new level of affluence in the nation . even anita garcia concedes that spain does n't wish to witness a return to its more barren pre-eu days .
" spain wo n't bite the hand that feeds it , and will ultimately agree to go along with anything to remain in the european fold , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german construction flourishes abroad german construction companies are having a tough time at home , and after walter bau filed for bankruptcy earlier this week more firms are looking to for profits outside of germany - where business is booming .

british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .

british newspapers said the four who carried out the bombings last thursday that killed at least 52 people on three subway trains and a bus in london were all britons of pakistani origin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the reports , which cited a variety of intelligence and police sources , said the bombers traveled to london together by commuter train from luton , a town just north of the capital .
after a brief and undemonstrative goodbye , they separated at king 's cross station in the center of the british capital before launching their attacks in thursday morning 's rush hour . the identities of the suspected bombers , aged between 19 and 30 years old , emerged after the police raids in leeds on tuesday .
the suspects were named in newspaper accounts as shehzad tanweer , 22 , hasib mir hussain , 19 , mohammed sadique khan , 30 , and eliaz fiaz , 30 .
some personal details were given such as that tanweer was a science major from leeds university , while khan was a married father of a baby girl who worked with handicapped children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the evening standard said hussain was to have bombed another subway line but the line had been suspended that day .
he then panicked and ended up setting off the bomb on the bus .
his driving permit and other personal effects were reported found in the remains of the bus . police gained vital clues from hussain 's parents , who knew their son was in london and were unable to contact him by phone once the bombs went off , the times said .
none of the four were on the files of security services , papers said , making them so-called " cleanskins , " terrorists with no previously known link to suspicious groups and thus incredibly hard to track down before they strike . police however have yet to say explicitly that all four attacks were carried out by suicide bombers . searching for masterminds bbc television , quoting senior security sources , reported that the police were searching for a fifth suspect who may have been their " controller " or the bombmaker .
in an interview with bbc radio , british home secretary charles clarke said " we have to attack the people who are driving , organizing and manipulating those people " who carried out the bombings in the british capital . ´ " and that 's of course where the police investigation is going just at this moment , " clarke said . he said he did not know " what was the nature of the relationship of these four people to people more widely , " without ruling out government suspicions that they were linked to or inspired by osama bin laden 's al qaeda organization .
he also said that the british authorities had to address " international links " to the bombings and to " organize ourselves on the basis there are other people prepared to act in this way . " unsettling realization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revelation that the bombers might be born-and-bred britons sparked a bout of national soul-searching in the press .
" suicide bombers from suburbia , " read the banner headline in the daily mail above a photograph of police vans standing on a street of ordinary-looking terraced houses in the northern english city of leeds , where police raided several homes on tuesday .
" the conclusion that the terrorists were home-grown is deeply unsettling .
it does not , in any way , close this case , " the times said in an editorial .
" is it really possible that no one beyond the bombers had any inkling of their intentions ? " it asked .
the guardian , for its part , described news that the bombers were british as " the worst of all possible outcomes . ...
it will have been the work of people brought up in our multi-racial society of which policy-makers were rightly proud .
this is not just a challenge for government but for civic society , too . "
the bombs on the london underground trains - near the aldgate , edgware road and king 's cross stations - went off at around 8:50 a.m.
-lrb- 0750 gmt -rrb- , with the one on the bus exploding nearly an hour later .
at least 52 people died , although some reports have said the final toll could approach 70 as police continue to search the wreckage of one of the trains in a tunnel deep under london . fighting the problem at the source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in prime minister tony blair 's weekly question time in parliament , he announced a plan to uproot the problem of religious extremism .
ministers will begin consultations on planned counter-terrorism legislation within the next couple of weeks , blair said .
prior to the bombings - the worst attack on british soil since world war ii - counter-terrorism proposals were denounced as a threat to civil liberties .
" we will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the uk who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good , and at how we deport such people , if they come here , more easily , " blair said .
the prime minister also said his government would begin talks immediately with british muslim leaders about combating the " poisonous and perverted misinterpretation of the religion of islam " by mobilizing moderate opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigation of london bombings heats up british police declared their first arrest tuesday in connection with the london bombings and said at least one bomber is confirmed to have been killed as the pieces began to fall together in a fast-moving probe .

officers were attacked with petrol and blast bombs as they withdrew from the ardoyne shops area after the return leg of an orange order parade to ligoniel .
bbc ni security editor brian rowan said an informed source told him dissident republicans linked to the continuity ira were behind the blast bomb attacks .
seven members of the public were injured and several people arrested .
it is understood the police officer 's injury is not life theatening .
a bbc journalist was also hurt during the rioting .
security forces were also attacked in brompton park .
a car was hi-jacked and burned and police used a water cannon on nationalist protesters .
in agreement with police , 15 protesters were allowed to stand on a wall overlooking the route as the orangemen passed holding aloft a banner saying ' make sectarianism history ' .
the twelfth of july orange order parades mark the victory of the protestant prince william of orange over the catholic king james ii at the battle of the boyne in 1690 .
sinn fein leader gerry adams , who was with the protesters , said " the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully " .
police were attacked with petrol bombs " when the police moved in what i think was quite a reckless manner they took management completely away from the stewards , " he said .
" they brought the water cannon in too quickly , we should have been allowed to keep order . "
the sdlp 's alex attwood described the rioting as an " utter disgrace " .
" having stood on police lines all night i can say the police behaviour has been characterised by restraint and compliance with minimum force required , " he said .

they are denied better job prospects because they lack all-round careers advice , according to the equal opportunities commission -lrb- eoc -rrb- .
the organisation claims working roles in wales are more based on a person 's gender than anywhere else in britain .
it is calling for school pupils to have the chance of work experience in jobs that challenge sexual stereotypes .
the report said that , with a few exceptions , young people in wales were still being channelled into jobs which are seen as appropriate to their gender .
it said three-quarters of welsh women were still working in low-paid jobs in cleaning , caring , catering , clerical work and customer services , while men dominated in better-paid trades and in engineering .
exceptions for women graduates include careers in medicine , accountancy or law , the eoc said .
women can be just as good as men , but the barriers facing women are very real jenny hunter , jive mentoring project otherwise , career choices for girls in wales were still governed by traditional notions of men 's work and women 's work .
julia zeal , 32 , from newport , has begun retraining as a plumber on coleg gwent 's women-only course , after leaving research and development in the chemical industry .
" when i left school , going into construction was n't an option .
i think probably it was something i would have liked to have done , " she said .
" a lot stems from careers teachers , they 're the people who need to get their act together and give better advice about what the options are .
" they obviously steer women in one direction , like nursing , and men in the other - it 's still like that .
" in terms of modern apprenticeships , it should be far more open to woman than it is at the moment . "
' acute segregation ' she added : " there are a lot of stereotypes when you 're out there , you see it all the time . "
the eoc report said work-role segregation by gender was particularly acute in small and medium-sized firms , with people from black and ethnic minorities , those with disabilities and welsh speakers even more likely to be in sex-segregated jobs .
the commission said all school pupils should have a careers interview to promote non-traditional work opportunities , as well as the chance of work experience in sectors where jobs were traditionally done by the opposite sex .
neil wooding , eoc commissioner for wales , said : " our research shows young people are unable to make genuine career choices and employers are unable to take best advantage of the talent available .
" as a result , major skills shortages will continue to blight business and damage the economy in wales .
tackling the barriers is an urgent priority . "
jenny hunter , coordinator of cardiff-based mentoring project jive , which helps women in apprenticeships in science , engineering , technology and construction , said the attitude in the male-dominated construction industry " still leaves a lot to be desired " .

she has apologised for calling an election commissioner while votes were being counted during may 's elections , but denies fraud and refuses to quit .

an emergency motion was put to members at its uk national conference in blackpool asking them to back a campaign to change the law .
critics of the law said it focused on union issues rather than matters such as discrimination , race or redundancy .
but employment committee president paul routier rejected the claims .
strikes do not do any good and we are trying to help resolve disputes senator paul routier he said : " there are further laws to be put in place on redundancy , but we are bringing in them in a gradual manner , suitable for jersey .
" it 's always been known we were going down that route and the states have backed that . "
he defended the law which forces unions to have a ballot before taking industrial action .
" if people have a dispute they should try to resolve it face to face or through the advisory and conciliation service , " he said .
" if that does not resolve it then an employment tribunal can resolve the situation .

dozens of villages have been abandoned as their hungry former residents go to towns or neighbouring countries , such as benin or nigeria in search of food .
" the situation is terrible , " said abdoulye adamou , who has come to the city of tahoua .
" we have no food and our cattle are dying in front of our eyes because of a shortage of water and food . "
he said that the government food supplied at reduced cost was not only insufficient , but too expensive for a poor farmer living on less than $ 1 per day .
poor rains and locust invasions last year devastated the farms leaving behind only desolate , charcoal grey hot sand .
skin and bones the government says that at least 3.5m people are suffering from food shortages and 150,000 children are severely malnourished in the regions of tahoua , maradi and zinder .
experts say this is niger 's worst food crisis since 1984-5 .
some children have already died from hunger , says aid agency medecins sans frontieres , which has set up camps where they offer free food and drugs to the needy .
the msf camp built in tahoua is the size of two football pitches .
sky-blue and white tents have been turned into makeshift hospitals , equipped with latrines , mosquito nets , beds and drugs .
children who have wasted away to little more than skin and bones lie on the floor , while other children are forced to drink the medicated porridge and milk offered by their mothers under the gaze of msf minders .
on the other side of the city , a team of dedicated nutritionists , nurses and paediatricians is struggling to save the lives of the 200 malnourished children in the wadata maternity camp .
improvement the children are fed every two hours and are looked after by a nurse and a skilled doctor .
many of those who live in this rural part of one of the world 's poorest countries have never been to school , especially the women and so the aid workers are teaching mothers about basic hygiene .
ibrahima ambouka , 3 , is so weak that he can not drink milk on his own .
his mother says he is now looking stronger after being given milk with vitamins and drugs .
mounaratou , 2 , travelled 20km to come to the camp a few days ago .
her ribs can be clearly seen through her skin and her hair has started to fall out - signs of severe malnutrition .
her mother says she vomits most of the milk and medicated water she is given .
but she , too , is showing a huge improvement just a day after arriving at the camp in a desperate state .
her three brothers are at home .
mounaratou was worst hit by the food shortages because she was still breast-feeding and her mother ran out of milk .
crisis downplayed aichatou , 52 , clearly acknowledges that the food shortage caused " hell to my child " .
" when the mother does not eat well , how can she produce milk for her baby ? " she asks .
the government has rejected calls to distribute free food to the hungry and has downplayed the extent of the food crisis .
a journalist with the state-owned sahel newspaper was even suspended from her job for reporting on the situation in zinder .
government critics have condemned its lack of action , saying that the crisis was widely predicted since last year , giving the authorities ample time to prepare .
tahoua regional health commissioner seydou hikoy , is looking beyond this year 's food shortages .
" the government needs more than one-off food assistance for the malnourished , " he says .
" food crises have become a recurrent phenomenon in arid areas like tahoua and we need a long-term programme of poverty and famine relief . "
he urges the government and donors to expand irrigated farming to help niger 's population " bridge the gap " between rainy seasons and cope with a year of poor rains , which at the moment can prove fatal .

this is the second worst food crisis in niger 's history dozens of villages have been abandoned as their hungry former residents go to towns or neighbouring countries , such as benin or nigeria in search of food .
" the situation is terrible , " said abdoulye adamou , who has come to the city of tahoua .
" we have no food and our cattle are dying in front of our eyes because of a shortage of water and food . "
he said that the government food supplied at reduced cost was not only insufficient , but too expensive for a poor farmer living on less than $ 1 per day .
poor rains and locust invasions last year devastated the farms leaving behind only desolate , charcoal grey hot sand .
skin and bones the government says that at least 3.5m people are suffering from food shortages and 150,000 children are severely malnourished in the regions of tahoua , maradi and zinder .
experts say this is niger 's worst food crisis since 1984-5 .
tents have become makeshift hospitals some children have already died from hunger , says aid agency medecins sans frontieres , which has set up camps where they offer free food and drugs to the needy .
the msf camp built in tahoua is the size of two football pitches .
sky-blue and white tents have been turned into makeshift hospitals , equipped with latrines , mosquito nets , beds and drugs .
children who have wasted away to little more than skin and bones lie on the floor , while other children are forced to drink the medicated porridge and milk offered by their mothers under the gaze of msf minders .
on the other side of the city , a team of dedicated nutritionists , nurses and paediatricians is struggling to save the lives of the 200 malnourished children in the wadata maternity camp .
improvement the children are fed every two hours and are looked after by a nurse and a skilled doctor .
many of those who live in this rural part of one of the world 's poorest countries have never been to school , especially the women and so the aid workers are teaching mothers about basic hygiene .
mounaratou has made a quick recovery ibrahima ambouka , 3 , is so weak that he can not drink milk on his own .
his mother says he is now looking stronger after being given milk with vitamins and drugs .
mounaratou , 2 , travelled 20km to come to the camp a few days ago .
her ribs can be clearly seen through her skin and her hair has started to fall out - signs of severe malnutrition .
her mother says she vomits most of the milk and medicated water she is given .
but she , too , is showing a huge improvement just a day after arriving at the camp in a desperate state .
her three brothers are at home .
mounaratou was worst hit by the food shortages because she was still breast-feeding and her mother ran out of milk .
crisis downplayed aichatou , 52 , clearly acknowledges that the food shortage caused " hell to my child " .
" when the mother does not eat well , how can she produce milk for her baby ? " she asks .
the government has rejected calls to distribute free food to the hungry and has downplayed the extent of the food crisis .
a journalist with the state-owned sahel newspaper was even suspended from her job for reporting on the situation in zinder .
government critics have condemned its lack of action , saying that the crisis was widely predicted since last year , giving the authorities ample time to prepare .
tahoua regional health commissioner seydou hikoy , is looking beyond this year 's food shortages .
" the government needs more than one-off food assistance for the malnourished , " he says .
" food crises have become a recurrent phenomenon in arid areas like tahoua and we need a long-term programme of poverty and famine relief . "
he urges the government and donors to expand irrigated farming to help niger 's population " bridge the gap " between rainy seasons and cope with a year of poor rains , which at the moment can prove fatal .

the dramatic soundtracks of today 's video games are a far cry from the time when arcades resounded to the noise of repetitive bleeps and jingles .
advances in technology mean music can now drive in-game action and stir players ' emotions , much like the score of a hollywood blockbuster .
in the us , two renowned video game composers are trying to tap in to gamers ' growing attachment to the soundtrack of their favourite software .
last week , in the first of a series of nationwide concerts , an audience of more than 10,000 heard the famous los angeles philharmonic orchestra playing the hits of the pixelated world . "
this is music people really love .
it is incredible for the audience to see their games come to life in a different way " jack wall video games live against a backdrop of images and lights , classically-trained musicians turned their hand to the themes from sci-fi epic halo , tomb raider , the mario games , plus a medley of old-school favourites like pong , space invaders and pacman .
for video games live co-founders jack wall and tommy tallarico , it is a sign of the ongoing evolution of games , both as entertainment and art .
" this is music people really love , " said mr wall , who wrote the music for jade empire , myst iii and splinter cell .

the show , which has proved a hit on both sides of the atlantic , is tipped to give us network abc its best showing at the television awards for years .
the programme has been entered as a comedy , so is expected to benefit from the end of friends and sex and the city , which ended in the last year .
drama the west wing will be looking for its fifth successful year in a row .
a nomination for best series for desperate housewives would give abc a crack at its first comedy award since home improvement in 1994 .
' bridesmaids ' the network last scooped an emmy for best comedy in 1988 with the wonder years .
desperate housewives creator marc cherry said the series is more of a drama , but added " we 're a weird fit wherever you put us " .
as for pundits tipping the show to get up to 20 nominations , he says it is unpredictable .
" some great shows like moonlighting were always bridesmaids , and we ca n't take anything for granted .
the sopranos will not be eligible for this year 's awards " for a first-year show like us to get even a few nominations , i 'll be ecstatic .
we 'll be keeping our expectations modest , " said mr cherry .
other comedies that could be competing head-to-head with desperate housewives is last year 's winner arrested development , and the final series of everybody loves raymond .
it seems likely that pay-tv network hbo will come away with far fewer nominations than last year 's 124 .
but the network is now without angels , which gained 24 nods , sex and the city and the sopranos , which did not air during the past year .
the broadcaster , which had almost double the nominations of its nearest rival nbc last year , could be without a representative in the comedy serial category for the first time in 13 years .
the emmy awards ceremony will take place in los angeles on 18 september .

cockle-picking was suspended at the salisbury bank in 2003 because of a decline in the shellfish numbers .
extra officers have been drafted in by environment agency wales , which has received 700 licence applications .
but concerns have been raised about the safety as the reopened bed can only be reached by boat .
cocklers from flintshire have been joined by people from as far afield as scotland and poland for the two day activity .
cocklers with permits are only allowed to harvest during daylight hours .
many had made their way to the shores by 0400 bst on wednesday to take advantage of the early sunrise , with some camping out to ensure an early start .
however , the number of people applying for licences was down on the last lifting in 2003 , perhaps because the opened salisbury bed was only accessible by boat . "
i want guarantees that this wo n't escalate out of control " councillor patrick heesom cockling in the dee estuary is a traditional activity carried out by hand-raking at low tide and then " riddling " the cockles to ensure only the larger shellfish are removed .
the environment agency , which oversees the sea fisheries , announced last month that the salisbury bank bed would reopen on 13 and 14 july with two further harvesting days to be set .
shell-fishing was suspended on the bank because of a decline in numbers .
three other banks - west kirby , thurstaston and mostyn - will remain closed during the two days of fresh cockling .
the beds will close again late on thursday while another survey is carried out , and may then re-open later in the month under existing laws , there are no limits on the number of licences issued , but the environment agency is seeking new regulations for next year , which would restrict the number of licensed cocklers to 50 .
police are preparing to put a safety plan into action in partnership with the environment agency , the health and safety executive , the department of work and pensions and other agencies .
but councillor patrick heesom , who represents the mostyn area of flintshire , said allowing so many cockle pickers out on to the beds is " a recipe for chaos " .
" there are serious health and safety issues to be addressed and , with so many licences being issued , i 'm concerned that the area is going to become over-run with marauding groups with little concern for the area , " he said .
" i want guarantees that this wo n't escalate out of control . "
some pickers has travelled from as far afield as scotland and poland for the opening of the beds .
reg blythe travelled from dumfries on tuesday to ensure he was in flintshire in time and slept on the banks of the estuary overnight .
he said : " this is the only cockle bed that 's open at the moment and it 's open for two days .
" a lot of these guys have been out of work for two-and-a-half months now , it 's time to make money . "
mike carruthers left home in the lake district at 0100 bst to arrive at the estuary by 0400 bst .
" we 've worked morecambe bay -lrb- in lancashire -rrb- for a few years now , that 's closed and we 've got ourselves permits to come down here because we 've got no work , " he said .
