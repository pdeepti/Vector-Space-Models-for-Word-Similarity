program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .

" it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .

" sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .

but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .

both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .

however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .

that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .

there are n't expected to be many . " there has never been so great a demand for world cup tickets , " said urs linsi , the general secretary of fifa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : " some disappointed people . " organizers guess that up to 30 million people will apply for tickets .
of the more than 3 million tickets , 260,000 will be of the cheapest variety , costing from € 35 to € 120 for the final . of the tickets already promised , linsi said he hoped unwanted tickets would be returned to fifa as soon as possible so that they could go to people that wanted them .
officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .
" not every seat was filled at the last world cup even when the matches were sold out , " linsi said , according to reuters .
" that was very frustrating . " non-transferable tickets each ticket will look like an airline ticket , with the applicant 's name on it .
the applicant will have to attend the game , as the tickets are n't transferable . for the first time , a small microchip on the ticket containing access information , but no personal data , will guard against forgeries and the black market . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public . " we are going to get some disappointed people , " franz beckenbauer , president of the organizing committee told a news conference .
" there 's no way to avoid that . " the majority of the 3.37 million tickets for 64 world cup games in 12 german stadiums will go to national soccer associations , sponsors , the media , vips and german soccer officials . that leaves 812,000 tickets , ranging from € 35 -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- for a first round ticket to € 600 -lrb- $ 782 -rrb- for the most expensive final ticket , free for the rest of the world . first ticketing phase begins on feb .
1 beginning feb .
1 , soccer fans will be able to log on to www.fifaworldcup.com and apply for tickets until march 31 .
since demand is expected to exceed supply , soccer 's world governing body will hold a lottery on april 15 to dispense the tickets .
world cup organizers advised fans to take their time and review the group schedule because filling out applications since being early wo n't increase chances of getting the tickets . schedules wo n't help much , though .
germany , as host , is the only country so far to qualify , making the first round match parings , never mind the quarterfinals , impossible to predict . after the first session of sales , a second lot of 300,000 tickets - again on a lottery basis - will be ready for allocation from dec .
1 to jan .
15 , 2006 .
demand unparalleled any tickets left over from the first round of sales will be available on a first-come , first-serve basis until nov .
15 , 2005 .
remaining tickets from the second lot will be on sale until april 15 , 2006 .
there are n't expected to be many . " there has never been so great a demand for world cup tickets , " said urs linsi , the general secretary of fifa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : " some disappointed people . " organizers guess that up to 30 million people will apply for tickets .
of the more than 3 million tickets , 260,000 will be of the cheapest variety , costing from € 35 to € 120 for the final . of the tickets already promised , linsi said he hoped unwanted tickets would be returned to fifa as soon as possible so that they could go to people that wanted them .
officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .
" not every seat was filled at the last world cup even when the matches were sold out , " linsi said , according to reuters .
" that was very frustrating . " non-transferable tickets each ticket will look like an airline ticket , with the applicant 's name on it .
the applicant will have to attend the game , as the tickets are n't transferable . for the first time , a small microchip on the ticket containing access information , but no personal data , will guard against forgeries and the black market . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event .

27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public . " we are going to get some disappointed people , " franz beckenbauer , president of the organizing committee told a news conference .
" there 's no way to avoid that . " the majority of the 3.37 million tickets for 64 world cup games in 12 german stadiums will go to national soccer associations , sponsors , the media , vips and german soccer officials . that leaves 812,000 tickets , ranging from € 35 -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- for a first round ticket to € 600 -lrb- $ 782 -rrb- for the most expensive final ticket , free for the rest of the world . first ticketing phase begins on feb .
1 beginning feb .
1 , soccer fans will be able to log on to www.fifaworldcup.com and apply for tickets until march 31 .
since demand is expected to exceed supply , soccer 's world governing body will hold a lottery on april 15 to dispense the tickets .
world cup organizers advised fans to take their time and review the group schedule because filling out applications since being early wo n't increase chances of getting the tickets . schedules wo n't help much , though .
germany , as host , is the only country so far to qualify , making the first round match parings , never mind the quarterfinals , impossible to predict . after the first session of sales , a second lot of 300,000 tickets - again on a lottery basis - will be ready for allocation from dec .
1 to jan .
15 , 2006 .
demand unparalleled any tickets left over from the first round of sales will be available on a first-come , first-serve basis until nov .
15 , 2005 .
remaining tickets from the second lot will be on sale until april 15 , 2006 .
there are n't expected to be many . " there has never been so great a demand for world cup tickets , " said urs linsi , the general secretary of fifa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : " some disappointed people . " organizers guess that up to 30 million people will apply for tickets .
of the more than 3 million tickets , 260,000 will be of the cheapest variety , costing from € 35 to € 120 for the final . of the tickets already promised , linsi said he hoped unwanted tickets would be returned to fifa as soon as possible so that they could go to people that wanted them .
officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .
" not every seat was filled at the last world cup even when the matches were sold out , " linsi said , according to reuters .
" that was very frustrating . " non-transferable tickets each ticket will look like an airline ticket , with the applicant 's name on it .

the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public . " we are going to get some disappointed people , " franz beckenbauer , president of the organizing committee told a news conference .
" there 's no way to avoid that . " the majority of the 3.37 million tickets for 64 world cup games in 12 german stadiums will go to national soccer associations , sponsors , the media , vips and german soccer officials . that leaves 812,000 tickets , ranging from € 35 -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- for a first round ticket to € 600 -lrb- $ 782 -rrb- for the most expensive final ticket , free for the rest of the world . first ticketing phase begins on feb .
1 beginning feb .
1 , soccer fans will be able to log on to www.fifaworldcup.com and apply for tickets until march 31 .
since demand is expected to exceed supply , soccer 's world governing body will hold a lottery on april 15 to dispense the tickets .
world cup organizers advised fans to take their time and review the group schedule because filling out applications since being early wo n't increase chances of getting the tickets . schedules wo n't help much , though .
germany , as host , is the only country so far to qualify , making the first round match parings , never mind the quarterfinals , impossible to predict . after the first session of sales , a second lot of 300,000 tickets - again on a lottery basis - will be ready for allocation from dec .
1 to jan .
15 , 2006 .
demand unparalleled any tickets left over from the first round of sales will be available on a first-come , first-serve basis until nov .
15 , 2005 .
remaining tickets from the second lot will be on sale until april 15 , 2006 .
there are n't expected to be many . " there has never been so great a demand for world cup tickets , " said urs linsi , the general secretary of fifa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : " some disappointed people . " organizers guess that up to 30 million people will apply for tickets .
of the more than 3 million tickets , 260,000 will be of the cheapest variety , costing from € 35 to € 120 for the final . of the tickets already promised , linsi said he hoped unwanted tickets would be returned to fifa as soon as possible so that they could go to people that wanted them .
officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .
" not every seat was filled at the last world cup even when the matches were sold out , " linsi said , according to reuters .
" that was very frustrating . " non-transferable tickets each ticket will look like an airline ticket , with the applicant 's name on it .
the applicant will have to attend the game , as the tickets are n't transferable . for the first time , a small microchip on the ticket containing access information , but no personal data , will guard against forgeries and the black market . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2005 does europe need stability or flexibility ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pact is meant to safeguard the euro 's value german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history .

in a vehement speech during the commemoration ceremony singer said that the lessons of the holocaust were being forgotten . " while apologists clamor holocaust fatigue , deniers receive open forums to spread their lies and instructors teaching the holocaust this week are shouted down by their students in various european countries , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2005 does europe need stability or flexibility ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pact is meant to safeguard the euro 's value german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .

for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2005 does europe need stability or flexibility ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pact is meant to safeguard the euro 's value german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .
" not every seat was filled at the last world cup even when the matches were sold out , " linsi said , according to reuters .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .

he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .

indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's deputy prime minister and foreign minister silvan shalom , right , talks with germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , left , at a reception for death camp survivors at the united nations , in new york .

" the state of israel 's right to exist and the security of its citizens will forever remain non-negotiable fixtures of german foreign policy .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

" right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .

i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths .

it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2005 does europe need stability or flexibility ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pact is meant to safeguard the euro 's value german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.01.2005 world cup tickets scarce before sales start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will genuine soccer fans be left ticketless ?
the coming weeks are sure to see some disgruntled soccer fans .
organizers for the 2006 world cup announced monday that only a third of the tournament tickets will be up for sale to the general public . " we are going to get some disappointed people , " franz beckenbauer , president of the organizing committee told a news conference .
" there 's no way to avoid that . " the majority of the 3.37 million tickets for 64 world cup games in 12 german stadiums will go to national soccer associations , sponsors , the media , vips and german soccer officials . that leaves 812,000 tickets , ranging from € 35 -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- for a first round ticket to € 600 -lrb- $ 782 -rrb- for the most expensive final ticket , free for the rest of the world . first ticketing phase begins on feb .
1 beginning feb .
1 , soccer fans will be able to log on to www.fifaworldcup.com and apply for tickets until march 31 .
since demand is expected to exceed supply , soccer 's world governing body will hold a lottery on april 15 to dispense the tickets .
world cup organizers advised fans to take their time and review the group schedule because filling out applications since being early wo n't increase chances of getting the tickets . schedules wo n't help much , though .
germany , as host , is the only country so far to qualify , making the first round match parings , never mind the quarterfinals , impossible to predict . after the first session of sales , a second lot of 300,000 tickets - again on a lottery basis - will be ready for allocation from dec .
1 to jan .
15 , 2006 .
demand unparalleled any tickets left over from the first round of sales will be available on a first-come , first-serve basis until nov .
15 , 2005 .
remaining tickets from the second lot will be on sale until april 15 , 2006 .
there are n't expected to be many . " there has never been so great a demand for world cup tickets , " said urs linsi , the general secretary of fifa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : " some disappointed people . " organizers guess that up to 30 million people will apply for tickets .
of the more than 3 million tickets , 260,000 will be of the cheapest variety , costing from € 35 to € 120 for the final . of the tickets already promised , linsi said he hoped unwanted tickets would be returned to fifa as soon as possible so that they could go to people that wanted them .
officials seem to want to avoid the malady that has plagued past tournaments , like the 2002 world cup and the european championships last summer in portugal , where large blocs of seats - allocated to various national soccer associations - were empty .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's deputy prime minister and foreign minister silvan shalom , right , talks with germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , left , at a reception for death camp survivors at the united nations , in new york .
in new york , foreign minister joschka fischer told the un general assembly monday that germany would always be linked to israel by the events at auschwitz . " the state of israel 's right to exist and the security of its citizens will forever remain non-negotiable fixtures of german foreign policy .
on this israel can always rely , " he said at a special un session dedicated to the anniversary . singer slams european attitudes however , world jewish congress chairman israel singer hit out on tuesday at european attitudes toward jews and called for a continent-wide commission to be formed to address the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world jewish congress governing board chairman israel singer .
in a vehement speech during the commemoration ceremony singer said that the lessons of the holocaust were being forgotten . " while apologists clamor holocaust fatigue , deniers receive open forums to spread their lies and instructors teaching the holocaust this week are shouted down by their students in various european countries , " he said . " and we experience insensitivity towards the holocaust by europe 's younger generation , sometimes from the highest and most important families , " he said , in an apparent veiled reference to britain 's prince harry dressing as a nazi . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un marks liberation of nazi death camps for the first time in its history , the united nations on monday marked the liberation of nazi death camps during world war ii , in an event attended by holocaust survivors and the foreign ministers of israel and germany .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's deputy prime minister and foreign minister silvan shalom , right , talks with germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , left , at a reception for death camp survivors at the united nations , in new york .
in new york , foreign minister joschka fischer told the un general assembly monday that germany would always be linked to israel by the events at auschwitz . " the state of israel 's right to exist and the security of its citizens will forever remain non-negotiable fixtures of german foreign policy .
on this israel can always rely , " he said at a special un session dedicated to the anniversary . singer slams european attitudes however , world jewish congress chairman israel singer hit out on tuesday at european attitudes toward jews and called for a continent-wide commission to be formed to address the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world jewish congress governing board chairman israel singer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.01.2005 holocaust literature shifts paradigms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the face of holocaust literature is gradually changing as the survivors die off , younger novelists have begun publishing secondhand accounts of the holocaust .
well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .

the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .

the eu is investigating whether the fees , collected by germany 's central office for licensing fees -lrb- gez -rrb- , are a kind of state subsidy .
" we are looking to see if public broadcasters in germany are possibly profiting from state support , " said the speaker of the commissioner , neelie kroes .
it is still uncertain if kroes views the fees as a state subsidy .
should the commission find that the fees violate eu law , the commission could make sure the fees properly meet the demands of the broadcasters .
zdf 's director-general , markus schächter , has already expressed fears that demands from brussels could cause fundamental changes in germany 's broadcasting system . dw-world.de media davids vs. goliath with government funding and hefty advertising revenues , public broadcasters in germany and europe have astronomically high budgets for buying olympic rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.01.2005 does europe need stability or flexibility ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pact is meant to safeguard the euro 's value german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

" that anti-semitism still exists is not to be denied .
it is the duty of all of society to fight against it , " schröder said in a speech at berlin 's german theater during a commemoration ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi concentration camp auschwitz . the ceremony was attended by death camp survivors , ministers and jewish leaders . " it is the common duty of all democrats to confront the offensive agitation of the neo-nazis and their continuing attempts to minimize nazi crimes , " schröder said , in a somber address befitting the historic weight of the occasion . more than one million people were killed by the nazis , mainly jews who were killed in gas chambers at auschwitz , southern poland from 1940 until the time it was liberated by the red army on jan .
27 , 1954 . ceremony clouded by npd scandal " no strong democracy should tolerate the enemies of democracy and tolerance , " said schröder , dressed in a black suit and tie , adding that the full power of the state was ready to combat anti-semitism . " right wing forces , with their dreary slogans and smear campaigns will receive the special attention of the police , " he said , against the backdrop of two large black and white photographs of the camp and some of the survivors . the anniversary commemorations in germany have been tarnished by a far-right political party 's refusal to observe a minute 's silence for holocaust victims in a regional parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of the npd celebrate their win in regional elections .
national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- representatives in the eastern state of saxony created a row on friday when they walked out of the assembly in dresden while members of other parties stayed to pay tribute . schröder 's government has tried to ban the npd for inciting racial violence but the case was thrown out in march 2003 after a two-year legal wrangle . the npd shocked mainstream parties when it won 9.2 percent of the votes in saxony in september and secured seats in a german state assembly for the first time since 1968 . chancellor expresses shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing a audience including the chairman of the world jewish congress , israel singer , and students , schröder emotionally expressed his shame and recounted the atrocities committed by the nazis . " sixty years after the liberation of auschwitz by the red army i stand before you as the representative of a democratic germany .
i express my shame over those who were murdered , and before those of you who have survived the hell of the concentration camps , " the chancellor said . " millions of children , women and men were suffocated by german ss troops and their accomplices with gas or starved and shot , " he said . " jews , sinti and roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , homosexuals , political opponents , prisoners of war and freedom fighters throughout europe were utterly destroyed with cold , industrial perfection or enslaved until their deaths . " during the ceremony , punctuated by at-times tearful speeches and stark pieces of music , he also paid tribute to the jewish community . " the jewish community in germany today is the third largest in europe .
it is vital and growing .
new synagogues are being built .
the jewish community is and remains an irreplaceable part of our culture and society , " he said . in closing comments , the chancellor said the events of world war ii and germany 's role in them would never be forgotten .
" with you , i bow before the victims of the extermination camps .
and if one day the names of the victims should fade from the memory of mankind , their fate will remain unforgotten .
they rest in the heart of history . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's deputy prime minister and foreign minister silvan shalom , right , talks with germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , left , at a reception for death camp survivors at the united nations , in new york .
in new york , foreign minister joschka fischer told the un general assembly monday that germany would always be linked to israel by the events at auschwitz . " the state of israel 's right to exist and the security of its citizens will forever remain non-negotiable fixtures of german foreign policy .
on this israel can always rely , " he said at a special un session dedicated to the anniversary . singer slams european attitudes however , world jewish congress chairman israel singer hit out on tuesday at european attitudes toward jews and called for a continent-wide commission to be formed to address the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world jewish congress governing board chairman israel singer .
in a vehement speech during the commemoration ceremony singer said that the lessons of the holocaust were being forgotten . " while apologists clamor holocaust fatigue , deniers receive open forums to spread their lies and instructors teaching the holocaust this week are shouted down by their students in various european countries , " he said . " and we experience insensitivity towards the holocaust by europe 's younger generation , sometimes from the highest and most important families , " he said , in an apparent veiled reference to britain 's prince harry dressing as a nazi . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un marks liberation of nazi death camps for the first time in its history , the united nations on monday marked the liberation of nazi death camps during world war ii , in an event attended by holocaust survivors and the foreign ministers of israel and germany .

a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? the euro may be riding high against the us dollar in the world 's foreign exchange markets these days , but it was n't always that way .
not long after the currency replaced france 's franc , italy 's lira and germany 's precious mark in 1999 , there were months when it looked like the euro 's slide against the greenback might never stop . back then , no european politician dared criticize the eu 's growth and stability pact , the budgetary rules designed to underpin the euro .
setting out deficit limits aimed at curbing profligate spending , the pact was at the time considered crucial in efforts to make the euro more like the stable deutsche mark than the wobbly italian lira . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you 're over 3.0 percent ?
so am ! "
but times have changed .
the two largest euro-zone economies , germany and france , have both repeatedly violated the pact 's deficit limit .
they have also torpedoed the european commission 's efforts to pursue disciplinary measures against those eu states that breach the pact 's deficit cap of 3.0 percent of a euro state 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . berlin pushes for revamp whereas germany was one of the main proponents of setting a deficit cap of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for euro members , berlin is now leading the charge for a more flexible interpretation of the pact .
and that makes some economists nervous . " the euro holds its own these days due to the good work of the european central bank over the past few years .
therefore one should n't talk about loosening the stability pact , " thomas straubhaar , president of the hamburg institute of international economics , told dw-tv .
" we should n't forget that the stability pact is n't tailored to germany alone - it 's valid for the entire euro zone .
which means one country alone ca n't claim it 's suffering unduly because of it . " chancellor schröder and his finance minister , hans eichel , have chaffed at the budgetary rules at a time when germany is struggling with high unemployment and weak growth .
both publicly support the goal of budgetary consolidation ; however , they also argue that rigidly following the stability pact endangers the recovery of europe 's largest economy . accordingly , schröder wants eu 's leaders at a summit in march to reinterpret the pact 's rules that would give his government more leeway . " the decisive criterion has to be a credible growth and employment policy that gives member states the necessary fiscal room for maneuver , " schröder wrote in a special guest article for the financial times newspaper last week . the chancellor wants brussels to cut euro-zone members some slack , so long as they have a plan in place for structural reform and for eventually getting their deficits and public debt under control .
he touts his so-called agenda 2010 , a package of labor market reforms and welfare cuts , as such a program . brussels gives in after long fighting a weakening of the pact , it now appears as if brussels is willing to play along .
eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia has said he will take into account such things like germany 's efforts to rebuild its depressed formerly communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when we judge the financial situation of a land , all relevant factors play a role .
naturally i consider that to include the enormous challenge of german unity , " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia told german news magazine focus on monday . that would ease pressure on berlin to slash its deficit .
however , some observers are skeptical whether a more flexible pact will do much to stimulate growth in germany or anywhere else in the euro zone . " i 'm not sure it 'll make a difference for growth , " katinka barysch , chief economist at the london-based think tank the center for european reform , told dw-world .
" france and germany have n't stuck to the deficit limits anyway and it 's hard to see how that 's helped their growth . " she said the revamped stability pact would likely be stripped of the threat of financial sanctions for euro members , but that peer pressure against fiscally wayward states might increase .
that could mean a rough time ahead for greece , which deliberately misled the commission about its high budget deficit for years . but even then , the rules will only be as tough as euro-zone countries are willing to enforce them .
" the stability pact is just a tool .
but it 's the only game in town , " said barysch . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate on euro 's fiscal framework continues eu finance ministers are pressing ahead with consultations on the european stability and growth pact in brussels on tuesday .

" our general strategy is the integration into european structures , " he said in response to questions from council of europe parliamentarians . european market a huge incentive that path , in the medium term , would not exclude historic links with russia , he said , but would rather seek to tap into the " six times bigger " eu market on his country 's western border . " it would be a mistake to not use the russian market , " but it would also " be a mistake if ukraine did n't find a key to open the door " to the eu market , he said . in terms of ukraine 's bid for eu membership , " we are not simply knocking on the door saying ' let us in , " ' yushchenko said , explaining that his government would work diligently towards meeting eu standards . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine looks westward to europe a day after taking his oath of office , viktor yushchenko heads to brussels where he hopes to prove his pro-western orientation and convince eu officials of his country ’ s readiness to enter the european bloc .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

well-known austrian literary critic sigrid löffler examines the shift away from the eyewitnesses ' recollections . on jan .
27 , 1945 the russians liberated the italian primo levi in auschwitz ; on april 11 , 1945 , the americans freed the spaniard jorge semprun in buchenwald .
after returning to their homes , both levi and semprun obeyed an overwhelming impulse : to bear witness to the atrocities that they experienced in the concentration camps - and survived , against all expectations .
both wrote down their still fresh memories . primo levi was the first auschwitz survivor to publish a book about his experiences : " if this is a man " appeared in autumn 1947 .
even though levi 's testimonial met with total disinterest and went practically unnoticed , this book now counts as one of the basic texts of what is now called holocaust literature .
what 's more , its incomparable balancing act between bearing testimony , reminiscence and reflection make " if this is a man " the best work that has been written on the topic of concentration camps . jorge semprun tried to write about his experiences directly after being liberated from buchenwald .
for half a year , he agonized over his writing .
but as opposed to primo levi , it was impossible for semprun to put his experiences in a relevant form at the time .
he first had to spend years forgetting , before he could again retrieve his memories .
not until 1960 was he able to face up to his experiences and write the first of numerous books about buchenwald concentration camp - " the long voyage . " literary creation of memory in the decades since , holocaust literature has constantly gained titles , authors and forms of presentation .
justified by having been witnesses and authenticated by their suffering , survivors have devoted themselves to the literary creation of memory .
one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

one thinks of " still alive : a holocaust girlhood remembered " by ruth klüger , " fateless " by imre kertesz , the books of edgar hilsenrath , louis begley , jerzy kosinski , tadeusz borowski , cordelia edvardson , george tabori , aleksandar tisma or victor klemperer , to name the most famous authors of reminiscences and testimonies . according to a thesis from egyptologist jan assmann , the past only comes into existence once one refers to it .
the past is n't a natural growth ; the past is a cultural creation .
since memory functions as a process of continuous description and reinterpretation of the past and since remembrance also includes the ongoing interpretation of events , the boundary between the authentic testimony of survivors and the retrospective appearance of original sources as literature can not be clearly and selectively drawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungarian author imre kertesz the witnesses themselves have often fictionalized rather than documented .
each work of literature denotes the establishment of artistic distance .
only after imre kertesz -lrb- photo -rrb- received the nobel prize in 2002 did this sort of literature of memory , which emerged in the last half century , finally receive the recognition and literary notoriety for its distinctiveness . shoah business if memory experienced should not be lost or disappear from collective memory , it must be transformed from biographical reminiscence into cultural memory ; personal memory must be conveyed from the experiences of eyewitnesses into the enduring form of literary construction . thus , one can not bar authors born later from going into the eyewitnesses ' archives of memory and making their own literary sense of their recollections .
indeed , we are now observing a change of paradigms in holocaust literature .
the victims are no longer the only ones who recount the holocaust .
ever more frequently - especially as the last eyewitnesses die off - holocaust storytellers have moved from drawing on their own memories to those of others .
what is now increasingly developing is a second-hand literature of memory . while memory experienced ends up in archives and those who remember disappear , memory procured by later authors carries on in the latter 's footsteps .
the holocaust is becoming something freely traded , the subject of art as well as commerce .
we face a delicate transition from factuality into fiction , from bearing witness to understanding , to the empathy of those born later via fantasy .
what we must expect in the future is holocaust fiction - from secondary literature on the effects to spoken artworks but also commercialization of the horror as " shoah business . " one would hope for the first - quality literature .
but the latter , commercial literature , must be accepted if a key idea of jewish thought is to preserve its validity - the key concept at yad vashem , the holocaust memorial in jerusalem : forgetting prolongs exile ; remembering is the secret to deliverance . sigrid löffler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder is attending a ceremony in berlin tuesday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp .

there is a fond assumption by much of the audience that the presenter decides who they would like to talk to that evening , a phone call is made and , obediently , the required guest appears in the studio at 10.30pm.
as a working hypothesis , it is about as wrong as could be .
where to start .
well , firstly , the presenters .
the essential skills necessary for the job , are , as nicholas tomalin once wrote about journalism , a plausible manner , a little literary ability and rat-like cunning .
on many programmes , even the last two requirements can be waived .
the day begins with a morning meeting where sad dreams are aired , it usually bears little relationship to what goes on air kelvin mackenzie once invented something called the news bunny for the fabulously catastrophic l ! ve tv news service .
grizzled old fleet street veterans were required to struggle into a furry nylon jumpsuit with enormous ears to report upbeat stories .
they disliked it not so much for the affront to their dignity but because of the appalling smell left by dozens of previous inhabitants .
but the news bunny once even got eight seconds with tony blair -lrb- in the days before he could hide behind the security apparatus of downing street -rrb- which i suppose proves the only people with even less dignity than journalists are politicians .
on reporting and dignity ...
the news bunny soon disappeared to the celestial carrot field , but was rumoured for a long while to be presenting one of the bbc 's major bulletins , disguised in a suit , a friendly smile and a belief that what we all needed was more " good news " .
certainly , 4pm editorial meetings were regularly punctuated with requests that someone stick a new battery into his backside .
newsnight presenters like to pretend they 're different .
but all they are is a bit more pompous .
for the sad truth is that on many a day they are just pathetically grateful for whatever they are given .
it 's true that sometime earlier in the day they may have expressed an urgent need to interview the president of russia or the chancellor of the exchequer .
by 10.30pm that night they 're relieved to find a research fellow from luton university and eric joyce mp sitting down with them .
i even once had to interview the world cluedo champion , who arrived dressed as colonel mustard .
i have a sneaking feeling that the producer responsible went on to edit the programme .
editorial darwinism the day begins with a morning meeting where sad dreams are aired .
it usually bears as little relationship to what goes on air as a holiday brochure does to the unbuilt hotel you finally occupy .
by five in the evening , the editor of the day is beginning to show nervous tics .
some shout a lot .
some go curiously silent .
others laugh in the face of imminent disaster but by 11am or so a notional running order has emerged .
with any luck , a reporter and producer will be offering a film of 10 or 12 minutes , which merely leaves the best part of 40 to fill .
the editor of the day sets perhaps four stories on the go .
then , a sort of editorial darwinism happens .
by the early afternoon one proposal will have turned out to be unrealisable for the very good reason that it is nonsense .
another will have collapsed because no guests can be found to contribute to a debate .
a third may still show signs of life , with calls out to half-a-dozen possible contributors and a producer and reporter having fun with some elaborate production conceit .
the fourth may even be coming together roughly as planned .
you look across the room and catch a handful of conversations .
" yes , i know 10.30 is the middle of the night in delhi , but we 're really interested to know what you think ...
we 'd send a car for you , of course ...
no we do n't normally pay a fee , i 'm afraid ... well i 'm sorry you had a bad experience last time , but i assure you we 're most interested in what you have to say " and most hopelessly , " he died three years ago ?
i 'm so sorry , i ca n't think why he 's still in our contact files . "
the skill is not just finding people and persuading them to speak , but persuading the right people to do so .
if you want a working definition of a producer 's job , it is persuading people to do things they do n't want to do .
and which are not in their own best interests .

others laugh in the face of imminent disaster .
in the past , we have had others who have disappeared and been found hours later hiding in the loo .
although it is the reporters and news bunnies of newsnight who get the public attention , the true heroes of the programme are its desk producers , graphics artists and video editors .
that anything gets on the air at all is often astonishing .
personally , i have no idea at all how they manage the production devices they bring off , let alone within the very limited time available .
for the presenter , much the most exciting days are those on which something happens in the late afternoon or early evening , and the whole running order is jettisoned .
these shows , on which no-one is quite sure what is going to happen next , and the first you know of who the next guest will be is when they sit down next to you and introduce themselves , are like surfing .
by 11.20pm it 's all over and we adjourn to the grim little cell in the basement laughingly called our " hospitality room " .

as the front man of hot chocolate , errol brown had a string of hits in the 1970s including ' it started with a kiss ' and ' everyone 's a winner ' the band 's success continued for 15 years , but front man brown was never out of the limelight .

more than three decades in the music business has n't lessened errol brown 's enthusiasm and now he 's back with a tour of the uk and the republic of ireland errol was tuesday 's breakfast special guest early days in 1969 errol brown was experimenting with the john lennon track ' give peace a chance ' - but changes to the lyrics had to be approved by lennon himself .
when he heard the track , he was so impressed that lennon released it on his apple label .
by the end of 1969 , errol and hot chocolate 's co-founder had been snapped up by micki most and within a year , they released their first single ' love is life ' which reached number six in the uk charts .
a phenomenal 30 thirty hit singles followed - who could forget the likes of ' you sexy thing ' , ' everyone 's a winner ' and ' it started with a kiss ' ?
popularity such has been the appeal of brown 's work with hot chocolate , that ' you sexy thing ' has been repeatedly used in films as recently as about schmidt in 2002 , rat race in 2001 and the 1997 smash hit the full monty .
he 's also made appearances in television programmes and films and several appearances on the bbc 's top of the pops programme .
in 1985 errol left the band and took time out to spend more time with his wife and then young children , resurfacing in 1990 and 1993 to embark on successful solo tours of the uk .
the full monty introduced a whole new generation to ' sexy thing ' , and hot chocolate seized the moment to release a compilation album in october 1997 .
it made the uk album top ten and sparked a 58 date tour alongside the re-release of ' it started with a kiss ' and now hugely in demand , he appeared in a television ad campaign .

china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion , which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats .

the capsule contains large amounts of the important substance researchers at cardiff university want to find out if a substance found in vegetables like cabbage and sprouts could ward off cervical cancer .
they need 3,000 volunteers for the study on the effects of the chemical- diindolylmethane -lrb- dim -rrb- - which is sold as a food supplement .
cancer research uk is funding the trial .
cervical cancer affects 3,000 women every year .
in wales , women over 20 are offered a smear test every three years .
women in cardiff who have slightly abnormal smear test results are being asked to take part in the study .
the research is being led by professor alison fiander .
" the study is looking at whether a food supplement called dim is able to reverse minor or mild cervical smear abnormalities and prevent the development of more serious abnormalities in the future , " she explained .
" dim is formed in the body naturally during the digestion of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli , sprouts and cabbage .
this supplement could provide us with a way of treating these minor abnormalities that does n't involve any more invasive treatment sue ashman " in fact you 'd need to eat more than two whole raw cabbages a day to obtain the same amount of dim as is present in the capsules we 're using in the study . "
if an abnormality is detected in a test , women are checked again after six months .
the research team want women to join their study during that six-month gap .
sue ashman , a research nurse involved in the trials , has to explain the procedure to women who are considering taking part .
" we just try and give a detailed breakdown of the trial , saying exactly what 's involved , that the trial runs for six months and that they 'll be expected to take this supplement every day for six months .
" just during the time that they would normally be waiting for their repeat smear . "
ms ashman said recruitment to the trial had been a " little bit slow " so far .
" i think cervical screening is not a very popular test among women and it may be difficult for them to come along , although all the trial means is that you have one additional test .

the capsule contains large amounts of the important substance researchers at cardiff university want to find out if a substance found in vegetables like cabbage and sprouts could ward off cervical cancer .

she is raising the matter over concerns that labels which describe products as " light " or " 90 % fat-free " can have no real legal meaning .
the issue is being discussed at the european industry committee .
the welsh consumer council is backing calls for the laws on food labelling to be tightened .
terms such as " light " and " extra light " are to be investigated by the committee and proposed laws on labelling will be discussed .
ms morgan said : " the strict food labelling laws already in place have come through european rules .
" we have , for example , the strictest gm labelling in the world .
however , there are some loopholes that need closing .
" when a product claims to be low in fat - that means something .
" it means that the product must contain less than 3g of fat per 100g of food .
most people do n't have the time or inclination to spend hours looking at labels when shopping for food lindsey kearton " when you claim something is ' light ' or ' extra light ' it also sounds very healthy - but it effectively means nothing .
" even ' extra light ' philadelphia contains 5g of fat per 100g of cream cheese for example .
there is simply no legal definition for ' light ' . "
she argued other labels could be equally misleading .
" ' 90 % fat free ' for example instantly hits you as a good thing , until you consider that the extra 10 % could be pure fat .
" supermarkets will also have to look carefully at their " healthy " ranges .
in some cases this just means having less fat content , whilst salt and sugar levels are actually sometimes higher than the standard product , " she added .
lindsey kearton , senior policy officer at the welsh consumer council , is supportive of new measures .
" most people do n't have the time or inclination to spend hours looking at labels when shopping for food .
" this means that they are more likely to be influenced by the more prominent , front-of-pack , information on food labels , which is frequently used to promote a product .
" at a time when people are being encouraged to take more responsibility for their own health , there needs to be greater transparency in the identification of ' healthier ' and ' not so healthy ' food . "

in 2004 , global sales of its life and pension products rose to £ 2.55bn -lrb- $ 4.79bn -rrb- from £ 2.377bn in 2003 .
the firm - which owns the norwich union brand - saw total uk sales climb 13 % .
" we had a strong finish to the year , having seen a gradual return of customer confidence in 2004 , " said group chief executive richard harvey .
' confident ' mr harvey said the group had " further developed " its business and distribution in asia and " continued to build momentum " .
just over a year ago the group announced it was outsourcing 2,350 norwich union posts from the uk to india , saying operating costs in india were typically 30-40 % lower .
aviva said it had been outperforming local markets in france , holland , italy and spain , while in the uk it had seen a return to growth in 2004 .
" we are confident of further profitable growth in 2005 , " said mr harvey .
its figures - which were on an ' annual premium equivalent ' basis , a standard measure used to iron out volatility - were ahead of analysts ' consensus predictions .

ceredigion and mid wales nhs trust said its findings had been confirmed by the department of health .
thirteen students from ysgol gyfun penweddig were treated in hospital after they were vaccinated in november .
dominic hamer , 13 , suffered an anaphylactic shock - a sudden serious physical reaction caused by an allergy .
the trust said this occured in one in a million receiving the vaccination , which combats tuberculosis .
another 12 students were treated at aberystwyth 's bronglais hospital with two kept in overnight . "
it 's a bit alarming that so many people were affected by bcg at the same time " paul hamer in a letter to parents at penweddig , the nhs trust 's chief executive allison williams concluded that the children " experienced severe but ' normal ' side effects to the bcg vaccination . "
she added that there was " no suggestion " of any fault in the storage , transport or administration of the vaccination .
she said : " further to your child attending bronglais hospital following bcg vaccination , the trust has undertaken a full investigation and i would like to take this opportunity to share with you our findings .
" as you know , 13 children -lrb- of the 118 vaccinated -rrb- attended the hospital with varying degrees of symptoms .
" one individual had a confirmed anaphylactic reaction which is reported to occur in approximately one in a million people receiving the vaccination .
" the other children were not considered to have experienced anaphylaxis and the results of the tests we performed in hospital confirmed that . "
summarising the investigation 's findings , ms williams added seven children reported symptoms before dominic suffered an anaphylactic shock .
she said the trust did not accept that it was an " anxiety reaction " in response to what happened to their friend .
" the symptoms experienced are consistent with those reported as ' normal ' side effects to bcg immunisation -lrb- dizziness , nausea , rash , feeling of being cold , shivering and breathing difficulties -rrb- , " said ms williams " there is no evidence to indicate any fault with the batch and this has been confirmed with the department of health .
" there is no suggestion of any fault in the storage , transport or administration of the vaccination .
" by process of elimination , the only conclusion we are able to come to is that the children experienced severe but ' normal ' side effects to the bcg vaccination . "
dominic hamer , from bow street , near aberystwyth , returned to school eight days after his ordeal .
his father paul said : " the trust admits that there was n't mass hysteria by students and that the problems the students had were normal .
" but it 's a bit alarming that so many people were affected by bcg at the same time at the same place .
" there 's been an investigation and that 's it until something happens again . "
dominic spent a night in intensive care before being transferred to a general ward .
following his severe reaction to bcg , the then welsh health minister jane hutt said there were no grounds for suspecting any fault with the bcg vaccine .

dominic spent a night in intensive care before being transferred to a general ward .

the trust said this occured in one in a million receiving the vaccination , which combats tuberculosis .
another 12 students were treated at aberystwyth 's bronglais hospital with two kept in overnight .

viruses , trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change .
the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash , steal valuable data or take over home pcs .
viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer .
instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code .
cash not code the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs .
before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines .
but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package .
defenceless broadband pcs are popular with criminals " you can not put them in to the neat little box that you used to , " said pete simpson , head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift .
now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms , or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments .
" it 's about outright criminality now , " said mr simpson , explaining why this change has come about .
he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order .
former virus writer marek strihavka , aka benny from the 29a virus writing group , recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers , phishing gangs , and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology .
no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors .
not least , said paul king , principal security consultant at cisco , because the defences against such attacks are so common .
" in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now , " he said .
few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written , many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data .
" if you think of criminals they do not do clever , " said mr king , " they just do what works . "
spies like us as the tactics used by malicious programs change , said mr king , so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves .
now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network .
few viruses are written to make headlines many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded .
as well as using different tactics , criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent .
" the main motivation now is money , " said gary stowell , spokesman for st bernard software .
mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high .
with almost any phishing or spyware attack , criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover .
so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends , to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites .
in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine .

viruses , trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change .
the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash , steal valuable data or take over home pcs .
viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer .
instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code .
cash not code the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs .
before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines .
but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package .
defenceless broadband pcs are popular with criminals " you can not put them in to the neat little box that you used to , " said pete simpson , head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift .
now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms , or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments .
" it 's about outright criminality now , " said mr simpson , explaining why this change has come about .
he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order .
former virus writer marek strihavka , aka benny from the 29a virus writing group , recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers , phishing gangs , and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology .
no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors .
not least , said paul king , principal security consultant at cisco , because the defences against such attacks are so common .
" in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now , " he said .
few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written , many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data .
" if you think of criminals they do not do clever , " said mr king , " they just do what works . "
spies like us as the tactics used by malicious programs change , said mr king , so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves .
now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network .
few viruses are written to make headlines many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded .
as well as using different tactics , criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent .
" the main motivation now is money , " said gary stowell , spokesman for st bernard software .
mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high .
with almost any phishing or spyware attack , criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover .
so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends , to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites .
in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine .

" if you think of criminals they do not do clever , " said mr king , " they just do what works . "

few viruses are written to make headlines many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded .
as well as using different tactics , criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent .
" the main motivation now is money , " said gary stowell , spokesman for st bernard software .
mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high .
with almost any phishing or spyware attack , criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover .
so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends , to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites .
in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine .

the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash , steal valuable data or take over home pcs .
viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer .
instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code .
cash not code the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs .
before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines .
but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package .
" you can not put them in to the neat little box that you used to , " said pete simpson , head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift .
now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms , or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments .
" it 's about outright criminality now , " said mr simpson , explaining why this change has come about .
he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order .
former virus writer marek strihavka , aka benny from the 29a virus writing group , recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers , phishing gangs , and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology .
no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors .
not least , said paul king , principal security consultant at cisco , because the defences against such attacks are so common .

moazzam begg , 36 , from birmingham , feroz abbasi , 24 , richard belmar , 25 , and martin mubanga , 32 , all from london , were detained at the military camp for nearly three years .
five other britons were returned to the uk in march 2004 and also released .
bbc news looks at the issues surrounding the britons ' detention .
how did the government help the four detainees most recently released ?
foreign secretary jack straw said the us had agreed to free the remaining four british detainees after " intensive and complex discussions " over security .
he said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003 .
downing street previously said it had pushed for their return and prime minister tony blair made a direct request to president bush .
talks on the detainees had taken place at many levels of the british and american governments , the downing street spokesman said .
but in july last year , mr blair said the us was not being " unreasonable " in refusing to release the last britons at guantanamo bay .
he said that he was not sure the security " machinery " was in place in the uk to ensure the men posed no threat .
what was lord goldsmith 's role ?
attorney general lord goldsmith , the government 's top lawyer , led the negotiations to free the detainees .
" i have personally worked hard on that issue and no-one , perhaps apart from the prime minister , is as anxious as i am to see the position resolved , " lord goldsmith told the bbc .
last year lord goldsmith voiced concern over the planned us military trials of suspects .
he said the tribunals were unacceptable as they would not offer a fair trial .
he said the right balance must be struck between security and individual freedoms in the fight against terror .
he also argued there can be " no compromise " on certain principles .
lord goldsmith and jack straw said the us should try detainees in accordance with international standards or return them .
what are the claims against the four ?
two suspects are said to have trained with al-qaeda in afghanistan and escaped us forces by going to pakistan .
a third is said to have trained with al-qaeda , met osama bin laden and volunteered for suicide missions .
it is said suspect four also trained at an al-qaeda camp and scouted the derelict uk embassy in kabul as a possible base .
the us says he was carrying a list of jewish groups in new york when caught .
it is understood uk police have been given dossiers on each of the men which were compiled by agents from the uk 's security service mi5 who had visited them nine times at guantanamo .
why were military trials planned ?
president bush announced plans for the military commissions to try 600 detainees at camp delta in 2003 .
the trials were in line with the us decision not to give guantanamo bay detainees prisoner of war legal status .
feroz abbasi and moazzam begg were believed to be two of six men to face the tribunals first .
however , in july 2003 , the us agreed to suspend the threat of secret military hearings against the british detainees , pending talks between the two nations .
the us held the first of its military tribunals for detainees in july last year .
why were the other five british detainees released in 2004 ?
the move was probably tied in with a visit to the us by the then home secretary david blunkett .
it allowed the british government to show a result from months of negotiations with the americans .
the us also gave details of the claims against the remaining detainees for the first time , as david blunkett arrived .
mr blunkett promised to push for the release of those detainees on the trip .
what happened to the released detainees ?
the first five men to be released were flown back to britain in march 2004 and questioned at london 's paddington green police station .
all were quickly released without charge .
four of the group launched a lawsuit against the us government in october 2004 .
in the first action of its kind , shafiq rasul , asif iqbal , ruhal ahmed and jamal al-harith each demanded £ 5.5m , alleging torture and other human rights violations .
a pentagon official said the allegations are false and the men are not entitled to a payout because they were captured " in combat " .
what happened to the latest detainees to be returned home ?
after arriving at raf northolt , the men were arrested under the terrorism act 2000 and taken to london 's paddington green police station for questioning .
all four were released without charge the following day and reunited with their families .
but washington said the uk had agreed to monitor them .

moazzam begg , 36 , from birmingham , feroz abbasi , 24 , richard belmar , 25 , and martin mubanga , 32 , all from london , were detained at the military camp for nearly three years .
five other britons were returned to the uk in march 2004 and also released .
bbc news looks at the issues surrounding the britons ' detention .
more than 500 terror suspects are being held at guantanamo bay how did the government help the four detainees most recently released ?
foreign secretary jack straw said the us had agreed to free the remaining four british detainees after " intensive and complex discussions " over security .
he said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003 .
downing street previously said it had pushed for their return and prime minister tony blair made a direct request to president bush .
talks on the detainees had taken place at many levels of the british and american governments , the downing street spokesman said .
but in july last year , mr blair said the us was not being " unreasonable " in refusing to release the last britons at guantanamo bay .
he said that he was not sure the security " machinery " was in place in the uk to ensure the men posed no threat .
what was lord goldsmith 's role ?
attorney general lord goldsmith , the government 's top lawyer , led the negotiations to free the detainees .
the attorney general led negotiations to free the british detainees " i have personally worked hard on that issue and no-one , perhaps apart from the prime minister , is as anxious as i am to see the position resolved , " lord goldsmith told the bbc .
last year lord goldsmith voiced concern over the planned us military trials of suspects .
he said the tribunals were unacceptable as they would not offer a fair trial .
he said the right balance must be struck between security and individual freedoms in the fight against terror .
he also argued there can be " no compromise " on certain principles .
lord goldsmith and jack straw said the us should try detainees in accordance with international standards or return them .
what are the claims against the four ?
two suspects are said to have trained with al-qaeda in afghanistan and escaped us forces by going to pakistan .
a third is said to have trained with al-qaeda , met osama bin laden and volunteered for suicide missions .
it is said suspect four also trained at an al-qaeda camp and scouted the derelict uk embassy in kabul as a possible base .
the us says he was carrying a list of jewish groups in new york when caught .
it is understood uk police have been given dossiers on each of the men which were compiled by agents from the uk 's security service mi5 who had visited them nine times at guantanamo .
why were military trials planned ?
former detainee jamal udeen alleged he was tortured in cuba president bush announced plans for the military commissions to try 600 detainees at camp delta in 2003 .
the trials were in line with the us decision not to give guantanamo bay detainees prisoner of war legal status .
feroz abbasi and moazzam begg were believed to be two of six men to face the tribunals first .
however , in july 2003 , the us agreed to suspend the threat of secret military hearings against the british detainees , pending talks between the two nations .
the us held the first of its military tribunals for detainees in july last year .
why were the other five british detainees released in 2004 ?
mr blunkett visited the us last year the move was probably tied in with a visit to the us by the then home secretary david blunkett .
it allowed the british government to show a result from months of negotiations with the americans .
the us also gave details of the claims against the remaining detainees for the first time , as david blunkett arrived .
mr blunkett promised to push for the release of those detainees on the trip .
what happened to the released detainees ?
the first five men to be released were flown back to britain in march 2004 and questioned at london 's paddington green police station .
all were quickly released without charge .
four of the group launched a lawsuit against the us government in october 2004 .
in the first action of its kind , shafiq rasul , asif iqbal , ruhal ahmed and jamal al-harith each demanded £ 5.5m , alleging torture and other human rights violations .
a pentagon official said the allegations are false and the men are not entitled to a payout because they were captured " in combat " .
what happened to the latest detainees to be returned home ?
after arriving at raf northolt , the men were arrested under the terrorism act 2000 and taken to london 's paddington green police station for questioning .
all four were released without charge the following day and reunited with their families .
but washington said the uk had agreed to monitor them .

the problem has been caused by a large increase in the number of officers retiring and claiming their pensions .
the force is asking the government to either give it the shortfall or let it pass the cost on to the taxpayer .
if it can not find extra money through these sources , the police authority has warned its front line services that are likely to suffer .
the amount is just too much to go ahead with our present services at our present level michael kennedy , lincolnshire police authority the problem has come about because officers recruited during a major recruitment drive 25 to 30 years ago have come to the end of their careers .
this has now left lincolnshire police facing an increase in pension costs of around 30 % , or £ 4m .
while the government is planning measures to deal with this in the long term , individual forces are currently having to face the costs themselves .
chairman of lincolnshire police authority , michael kennedy , said : " inevitably it will mean services are affected - the amount is just too much to got ahead with our present services at our present level .
" we would have to go to the people of lincolnshire and increase our precept but this is being controlled , restricted to a 5 % increase , commonly called capping , which leaves us nowhere to turn . "

mr hague said criminal gangs were blighting the uk with the problem , with women pressed into prostitution .
asylum plans unveiled by the tories on leader michael howard would help address the problem , said mr hague .
as the pre-election campaign continues , the tory mp predicted the poll would be " very close indeed " .

most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse .
but when asked about their own family 's financial outlook , a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future .
almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll , which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster .
the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill , compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving .
those surveyed in three countries were split .
in percentage terms , an average of 44 % of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse , compared to 34 % who said it was improving .
similarly , 48 % were pessimistic about their national economy , while 41 % were optimistic .
and 47 % saw their family 's economic conditions improving , as against 36 % who said they were getting worse .
the poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan , together with the program on international policy attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- at the university of maryland .
" while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago , people seem to not have fully absorbed this development , though they are personally experiencing its effects , " said pipa director steven kull .
" people around the world are saying : ' i 'm ok , but the world is n't ' . "
there may be a perception that war , terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place , even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance , says the bbc 's elizabeth blunt .
from buoyant to gloomy the countries where people were most optimistic , both for the world and for their own families , were two fast-growing developing economies , china and india , followed by indonesia .
china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth , which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale , says the bbc 's louisa lim in beijing .
but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country 's rosy economic future , our correspondent says .
south korea was the most pessimistic , while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy .
the bbc 's david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001 , which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be .
the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents ' families , but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy .
pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews .
the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005 .
the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points , depending on the country .
in eight of the countries , the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas .

for two weeks , we will be publishing a range of accounts from people inside iraq about their day-to-day lives .
you can bookmark this page and come back to read the latest posts each day .
about this log the iraq log rss feed a help page on rss feeds i ca n't tell anyone i 'm a candidate posted by zeina candidate , baghdad , 24 january as a candidate in the election , i ca n't do that much .
i 'm afraid to give you my full name because if people opposed to the election find out they may come to the house and kill us .
i ca n't tell strangers that i am running in the election .
our party , the national democratic party , has more than 300 members and about 30 candidates in the election , half of whom are women .
conditions in baghdad at the moment are very poor .
there is little electricity or gas , we have to queue for hours to get just a little bit of gas for our cars .
as you know , in baghdad there are daily bombs and many people are being killed .
you see posters of the candidates for the main parties all over baghdad .
you can even run into some of these publicly declared candidates at private meetings , but they have heavy security .
you never see them on the streets , meeting voters and campaigning in the normal way .
it 's just not safe .
it is hard to be a candidate in this election .
i do go out and meet people , but most of them are relations or friends or colleagues , one way or another .
i hope nothing terrible happens on election day .
people are praying it will go smoothly .
i think it will also be hard for people who want to vote .
people will be afraid to go to the polling stations , and given the difficulty of campaigning , people just do n't know who they are voting for .
but i and all my family will be voting - i think we can vote near where we live in the centre of baghdad .
i 'm desperate to vote .
i want a better future for my country and this will help .
i also think that sunni muslims in iraq will change their minds and vote .
they want to but are being intimidated .
if they do n't vote , they will not be represented at the centre of power and this in itself will cause problems .
unity , against the killers and bombers , is the key for iraq as a whole .
as for the us soldiers , for the time being it is good that they stay .
without them the situation would be terrible .
but , long term , they must leave .
i am a housewife at the moment , but i used to be a librarian .
if i am elected , my priority will be to change the situation of children in our society .
at the moment few have schools , or anywhere to go to play safely .
that 's my main election promise - to work to improve life for children .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post no sign of election here posted by tariq al-ani student , hit , 24 january there are many reasons why people wo n't vote where i am .
one is security - people are frightened that the polling stations could be bombed .
another reason is that people do n't feel they have a lot to gain from voting .
the shia people in the south want to vote .
they were abused under saddam hussein and hope they can gain some power in the future through the election .
on election day , i 'll be staying home with my family .
i think that 90 % of the people in hit will do the same .
after the elections in hit it will be fine , there will be no civil war , no big military operations .
people here want to keep things calm .
there is no sign that an election is about to happen in this town - there are no posters , no one talks about the election , there are no meetings or campaigning , even in private .
the whole thing is very remote for people in hit .
the situation here is bad like elsewhere .
there are shortages of basic things like gasoline .
the vast majority of people have lost their jobs .
people get by any way they can .
some have turned to crime , there is a lot of robbery and looting .
it 's safe to be out and about in hit during the day , but after sunset it gets dangerous and after midnight even more dangerous .
you do n't know where the threat is coming from , there is a lot of random shooting and you do n't know who is doing the shooting .
this has been going on for a long time .
during the day you can go to the market , you can go driving , but once it gets dark , that 's it .
as for the police , they wo n't and ca n't do much , and most of the time they are themselves hiding from trouble .
the violence here has become ordinary .
it surprises me how my family copes .
if there is a big bomb attack or a bombing by the american forces we all feel frightened , but life soon gets back to normal .
what we have a problem with in hit is internally displaced people .
when the americans attacked falluja many people moved here .
people here were against the attack on falluja and offered their assistance to people from the city .
there are deep family ties between hit and falluja .
at the time , we also were worried that the american forces would come here as well .
there are still many fallujans in hit , probably about 1,000 families altogether and we do what we can to assist them .
some are trying to get jobs here .
they 're not planning to go back to falluja any time soon .
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post i am always aware that i am a target posted by elma american contractor , near mosul , 24 january i am an american woman working as a contractor in northern iraq , south of mosul .
i spent the first six months of my time here in mosul .
i had no prior experience of war , and i was n't really sure what to expect .
i still am not sure i have the words to describe what i 've witnessed these last few months .
i 've been shot at incessantly , friends of mine have been killed , and have seen far more than i ever wanted to see .
one should be careful what one asks for ; one may just get it .
anyway , these days find me in a rather quiet corner of the country - yes , there are quiet corners - a little south of mosul proper .
there is no shooting here - there is nothing at all here .
the entire facility is bounded by endless nothingness .
even so , i know i am in iraq , and i know just how dangerous this country is .
i can never truly relax here .
i know i am a target .
i fear that the future here is bleak - for us , the americans , and for the iraqis .
when i first came here i met iraqis , enjoyed speaking with them , and made friends with a few .
it has been a long time since i have seen any of them .
they have been killed , kidnapped , or simply disappeared for reasons of self-preservation .
i am afraid i am not very objective about all of this , as it is unfolding around me .
i am a part of it now , and i can only speak of what i have seen .
fairy tales begin with " once upon a time ... " and end with " ... happily ever after " .
this is n't a fairy tale .
this is a nightmare , and i do n't know when i will wake up .
the election is being advertised as a turning point for iraq - but the departure of the coalition provisional authority was supposed to be one such turning point .
read about elma and the other log contributors comment on this post these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
i have no understanding of what your situation is really like zeina as i live in wonderful , peaceful australia .
all i can say is that i am in awe of your courage .
i work with children and i truly hope your desire for their safety and chance to play in peace is realised .
good luck and my thoughts are with you and all those in iraq who desire to make their country a wonderful place to bring up their children .
lyn hodkinson , australia as an arab , it is disheartening and very sad to hear and watch what our brothers and sisters in iraq are going through every day .
we watch and hear of their pains but do nothing .
we send them what we can on an individual basis , but that is a drop in the ocean to what they need .
i also believe that there are many arab countries pray that the iraqi mission do not succeed and fail - as they will be next !
it is in their interest to keep the mess inside iraq like they did during the lebanese civil war .
they should learn better and stop .
mahmood abdul hussain , bahrain zeina , i 'm an american .
i write to express how much i admire your courage and i how much i admire the courage of every iraqi who votes .
please remember that under democracy , the good people will always win in the long run .
michael lusk , sunnyvale , usa i hope that many people will have the courage to vote !
they - and you , zeina , as a candidate - deserve our highest respect .
let 's hope that the bloodshed can be contained and that you will have a new beginning , which you deserve .
brigitte bischoff-doll , germany so anxious to get an unfiltered stream of info from the ordinary iraqi citizen .
thanks bbc for the service - good job !
david gebhardt , dallas , texas today , i registered for elections !
security was good , and also , i found out that to register one does not have to put one 's personal address in the list of registrants .
this is the case in all the 14 countries hosting this historic event .
it felt really good to register .
i am praying for the safety of all voters .
after sleepless nights thinking about all the complicated issues concerning elections under occupation , i have come to the conclusion that it is better to have a democracy under occupation than never !
we iraqis can start with voting , then push for real independence .
junea , toronto , canada be brave .
be strong .
do not listen to the -lrb- european -rrb- nay-sayers who would prefer iraqi people to suffer failure , rather than admit that history will prove you -lrb- and the countries who gave you this opportunity -rrb- brave and courageous and just .
hassan , new york city , usa if candidates are so afraid to contact voters and are forced to hide their identity , than of course it is not an election but a mockery of one .
democracy does not means counting some votes polled by one unknown for another unknown .
an election may only be held in a free and fair atmosphere where every person - candidate or voter - has the freedom to express his will .
smagha , new delhi , india i feel deeply sorry for the average citizen in iraq who , regardless of disposition , is being judged on extremist political and religious factors .
an american juggernaut trying to save face and a frenzied fundamentalist movement hellbent on all out holy war have turned iraq into chaos and anarchy .
vote - it 's all you can do and it 's your only hope of stability .
gareth evans , london , uk i 'm just wondering , i know some of the oil fields were burned by saddam 's men before his fall , but surely there is a lot of oil left ?
if there is a shortage of gasoline , surely this problem could be solved quickly with a little bit of help from coalition governments ?
we 're quick to give aid to the tsunami but not victims of war and oppression .
the government that is .
how much is being / will be given to help rebuild iraq ?
jonny , nottingham , uk it is sad to see that because of some fanatics many people lose their lives .
i feel sorry for the people who go around blowing themselves up to kill the innocent and hoping for a piece of heaven - this brainwashed mentality has to stop .
if only we could set our religious and cultural beliefs aside this world would be a better place .
good luck to the iraqis and strength to the us forces .
pedro , maputo , mozambique i want this election to pass without casualties , iraq was run by a brutal candidate before and this will not happen again .
a big shame for those who still do n't want democracy which will bring the peace for all iraqis. kiss , bedford , england there are certain events that will forever define a country , this first election being one of them .
the courage of any iraqi people who go and vote is inspiring to the rest of the world .
i truly do n't believe the us meant to turn your land into a frontline for fighting terrorism and the rest of the world should take note of how the majority of the people have been able to cope .
thank you for your bravery .
eric wigton , st louis , usa i do n't think many americans can truly appreciate your situation due to the sterilisation of us news media , although many of us try - this forum helps .
ultimately , though , it is your country and you have a say and a responsibility .
one man or woman alone has only hope and faith .
a country united is as strong as its people .
do the weapons of the few outnumber the faith and the hope of the masses ?
be strong .
be heard .
kevin , bellevue , usa my heart and thoughts will be with all iraqi citizens this whole week and i pray that all who can will find the courage to lead their country and their lives into an unbelievably better new era .
please , please - if you can , do try to vote .
it is the iraqi citizens right now , who are the real heroes - the real soldiers .
michael bennett , nova scotia , canada the comments from the american lady reflect what most of the contractors coming back here from iraq say - when will bush realise that emperor has no clothes ?
ken fleming , houston , texas , usa i am saddened by the number of killings leading up to the elections in iraq .
i fully supported the idea of not postponing the elections as it would only delay the opportunity for iraq to be governed by iraqis .
i also do not understand why muslims are killing muslims .
do these terrorists want to follow the same route saddam used to gain control of iraq ?
stanton clarke , newbury , uk american citizens , please devote some of your time in reading these articles .
then you will know how much the american media misinforms .
usuf , kannur , india my heart goes out to all the iraqis that really do want peace and a free and democratic country .
they are being so intimidated that you can not blame them for being scared to mention their names .
i would say to zeina that we want to leave iraq as bad as you want us to leave , however , we all know it would be total anarchy if we were to withdraw too soon .
but believe me , we want to leave but at the same time we want to leave the country with a government that can stand up to the terrorists .
please vote and take your country back from the terrorists and baathists who want to continue to repress the citizens .
steve , brno , czech republic this is an understatement of the difficulties in baghdad at the moment .
according to other sources there has been little or no running water for the past week or so .
this is really a very serious and dangerous situation and brings disgrace on us as the occupying authority .
alan murphy , cheltenham , uk it was really helpful to read the stories of people inside iraq in a day to day format without editorialising the stories .
bridget , buffalo , usa it 's too bad the country we 're supposedly " giving back to the iraqi people " has become a veritable living hell because of those very efforts .
still , good luck to every one of you .

for two weeks , we will be publishing a range of accounts from people inside iraq about their day-to-day lives .
you can bookmark this page and come back to read the latest posts each day .
about this log the iraq log rss feed a help page on rss feeds i ca n't tell anyone i 'm a candidate posted by zeina candidate , baghdad , 24 january as a candidate in the election , i ca n't do that much .
i 'm afraid to give you my full name because if people opposed to the election find out they may come to the house and kill us .
i ca n't tell strangers that i am running in the election .
our party , the national democratic party , has more than 300 members and about 30 candidates in the election , half of whom are women .
conditions in baghdad at the moment are very poor .
there is little electricity or gas , we have to queue for hours to get just a little bit of gas for our cars .
as you know , in baghdad there are daily bombs and many people are being killed .
you see posters of the candidates for the main parties all over baghdad .
you can even run into some of these publicly declared candidates at private meetings , but they have heavy security .
you never see them on the streets , meeting voters and campaigning in the normal way .
it 's just not safe .
it is hard to be a candidate in this election .
i do go out and meet people , but most of them are relations or friends or colleagues , one way or another .
i hope nothing terrible happens on election day .
people are praying it will go smoothly .
i think it will also be hard for people who want to vote .
people will be afraid to go to the polling stations , and given the difficulty of campaigning , people just do n't know who they are voting for .
but i and all my family will be voting - i think we can vote near where we live in the centre of baghdad .
i 'm desperate to vote .
i want a better future for my country and this will help .
i also think that sunni muslims in iraq will change their minds and vote .
they want to but are being intimidated .
if they do n't vote , they will not be represented at the centre of power and this in itself will cause problems .
unity , against the killers and bombers , is the key for iraq as a whole .
as for the us soldiers , for the time being it is good that they stay .
without them the situation would be terrible .
but , long term , they must leave .
i am a housewife at the moment , but i used to be a librarian .
if i am elected , my priority will be to change the situation of children in our society .
at the moment few have schools , or anywhere to go to play safely .
that 's my main election promise - to work to improve life for children .

you see posters of the candidates for the main parties all over baghdad .
you can even run into some of these publicly declared candidates at private meetings , but they have heavy security .
you never see them on the streets , meeting voters and campaigning in the normal way .
it 's just not safe .
it is hard to be a candidate in this election .
i do go out and meet people , but most of them are relations or friends or colleagues , one way or another .
i hope nothing terrible happens on election day .
people are praying it will go smoothly .
i think it will also be hard for people who want to vote .
people will be afraid to go to the polling stations , and given the difficulty of campaigning , people just do n't know who they are voting for .
but i and all my family will be voting - i think we can vote near where we live in the centre of baghdad .
i 'm desperate to vote .
i want a better future for my country and this will help .
i also think that sunni muslims in iraq will change their minds and vote .
they want to but are being intimidated .
if they do n't vote , they will not be represented at the centre of power and this in itself will cause problems .
unity , against the killers and bombers , is the key for iraq as a whole .
as for the us soldiers , for the time being it is good that they stay .
without them the situation would be terrible .
but , long term , they must leave .
i am a housewife at the moment , but i used to be a librarian .
if i am elected , my priority will be to change the situation of children in our society .
at the moment few have schools , or anywhere to go to play safely .
that 's my main election promise - to work to improve life for children .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post no sign of election here posted by tariq al-ani student , hit , 24 january there are many reasons why people wo n't vote where i am .
one is security - people are frightened that the polling stations could be bombed .
another reason is that people do n't feel they have a lot to gain from voting .
the shia people in the south want to vote .
they were abused under saddam hussein and hope they can gain some power in the future through the election .
on election day , i 'll be staying home with my family .
i think that 90 % of the people in hit will do the same .
after the elections in hit it will be fine , there will be no civil war , no big military operations .
people here want to keep things calm .
there is no sign that an election is about to happen in this town - there are no posters , no one talks about the election , there are no meetings or campaigning , even in private .
the whole thing is very remote for people in hit .
the situation here is bad like elsewhere .
there are shortages of basic things like gasoline .
the vast majority of people have lost their jobs .
people get by any way they can .
some have turned to crime , there is a lot of robbery and looting .
it 's safe to be out and about in hit during the day , but after sunset it gets dangerous and after midnight even more dangerous .
you do n't know where the threat is coming from , there is a lot of random shooting and you do n't know who is doing the shooting .
this has been going on for a long time .
during the day you can go to the market , you can go driving , but once it gets dark , that 's it .
as for the police , they wo n't and ca n't do much , and most of the time they are themselves hiding from trouble .
the violence here has become ordinary .
it surprises me how my family copes .
if there is a big bomb attack or a bombing by the american forces we all feel frightened , but life soon gets back to normal .
what we have a problem with in hit is internally displaced people .
when the americans attacked falluja many people moved here .
people here were against the attack on falluja and offered their assistance to people from the city .
there are deep family ties between hit and falluja .
at the time , we also were worried that the american forces would come here as well .
there are still many fallujans in hit , probably about 1,000 families altogether and we do what we can to assist them .
some are trying to get jobs here .
they 're not planning to go back to falluja any time soon .
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post i am always aware that i am a target posted by elma american contractor , near mosul , 24 january i am an american woman working as a contractor in northern iraq , south of mosul .
i spent the first six months of my time here in mosul .
i had no prior experience of war , and i was n't really sure what to expect .
i still am not sure i have the words to describe what i 've witnessed these last few months .
i 've been shot at incessantly , friends of mine have been killed , and have seen far more than i ever wanted to see .
one should be careful what one asks for ; one may just get it .
anyway , these days find me in a rather quiet corner of the country - yes , there are quiet corners - a little south of mosul proper .
there is no shooting here - there is nothing at all here .
the entire facility is bounded by endless nothingness .
even so , i know i am in iraq , and i know just how dangerous this country is .
i can never truly relax here .
i know i am a target .
i fear that the future here is bleak - for us , the americans , and for the iraqis .
when i first came here i met iraqis , enjoyed speaking with them , and made friends with a few .
it has been a long time since i have seen any of them .
they have been killed , kidnapped , or simply disappeared for reasons of self-preservation .
i am afraid i am not very objective about all of this , as it is unfolding around me .
i am a part of it now , and i can only speak of what i have seen .
fairy tales begin with " once upon a time ... " and end with " ... happily ever after " .
this is n't a fairy tale .
this is a nightmare , and i do n't know when i will wake up .
the election is being advertised as a turning point for iraq - but the departure of the coalition provisional authority was supposed to be one such turning point .
read about elma and the other log contributors comment on this post these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
i have no understanding of what your situation is really like zeina as i live in wonderful , peaceful australia .
all i can say is that i am in awe of your courage .
i work with children and i truly hope your desire for their safety and chance to play in peace is realised .
good luck and my thoughts are with you and all those in iraq who desire to make their country a wonderful place to bring up their children .
lyn hodkinson , australia as an arab , it is disheartening and very sad to hear and watch what our brothers and sisters in iraq are going through every day .
we watch and hear of their pains but do nothing .
we send them what we can on an individual basis , but that is a drop in the ocean to what they need .
i also believe that there are many arab countries pray that the iraqi mission do not succeed and fail - as they will be next !
it is in their interest to keep the mess inside iraq like they did during the lebanese civil war .
they should learn better and stop .
mahmood abdul hussain , bahrain zeina , i 'm an american .
i write to express how much i admire your courage and i how much i admire the courage of every iraqi who votes .
please remember that under democracy , the good people will always win in the long run .
michael lusk , sunnyvale , usa i hope that many people will have the courage to vote !
they - and you , zeina , as a candidate - deserve our highest respect .
let 's hope that the bloodshed can be contained and that you will have a new beginning , which you deserve .
brigitte bischoff-doll , germany so anxious to get an unfiltered stream of info from the ordinary iraqi citizen .
thanks bbc for the service - good job !
david gebhardt , dallas , texas today , i registered for elections !
security was good , and also , i found out that to register one does not have to put one 's personal address in the list of registrants .
this is the case in all the 14 countries hosting this historic event .
it felt really good to register .
i am praying for the safety of all voters .
after sleepless nights thinking about all the complicated issues concerning elections under occupation , i have come to the conclusion that it is better to have a democracy under occupation than never !
we iraqis can start with voting , then push for real independence .
junea , toronto , canada be brave .
be strong .
do not listen to the -lrb- european -rrb- nay-sayers who would prefer iraqi people to suffer failure , rather than admit that history will prove you -lrb- and the countries who gave you this opportunity -rrb- brave and courageous and just .
hassan , new york city , usa if candidates are so afraid to contact voters and are forced to hide their identity , than of course it is not an election but a mockery of one .
democracy does not means counting some votes polled by one unknown for another unknown .
an election may only be held in a free and fair atmosphere where every person - candidate or voter - has the freedom to express his will .
smagha , new delhi , india i feel deeply sorry for the average citizen in iraq who , regardless of disposition , is being judged on extremist political and religious factors .
an american juggernaut trying to save face and a frenzied fundamentalist movement hellbent on all out holy war have turned iraq into chaos and anarchy .
vote - it 's all you can do and it 's your only hope of stability .
gareth evans , london , uk i 'm just wondering , i know some of the oil fields were burned by saddam 's men before his fall , but surely there is a lot of oil left ?
if there is a shortage of gasoline , surely this problem could be solved quickly with a little bit of help from coalition governments ?
we 're quick to give aid to the tsunami but not victims of war and oppression .
the government that is .
how much is being / will be given to help rebuild iraq ?
jonny , nottingham , uk it is sad to see that because of some fanatics many people lose their lives .
i feel sorry for the people who go around blowing themselves up to kill the innocent and hoping for a piece of heaven - this brainwashed mentality has to stop .
if only we could set our religious and cultural beliefs aside this world would be a better place .
good luck to the iraqis and strength to the us forces .
pedro , maputo , mozambique i want this election to pass without casualties , iraq was run by a brutal candidate before and this will not happen again .
a big shame for those who still do n't want democracy which will bring the peace for all iraqis. kiss , bedford , england there are certain events that will forever define a country , this first election being one of them .
the courage of any iraqi people who go and vote is inspiring to the rest of the world .
i truly do n't believe the us meant to turn your land into a frontline for fighting terrorism and the rest of the world should take note of how the majority of the people have been able to cope .
thank you for your bravery .
eric wigton , st louis , usa i do n't think many americans can truly appreciate your situation due to the sterilisation of us news media , although many of us try - this forum helps .
ultimately , though , it is your country and you have a say and a responsibility .
one man or woman alone has only hope and faith .
a country united is as strong as its people .
do the weapons of the few outnumber the faith and the hope of the masses ?
be strong .
be heard .
kevin , bellevue , usa my heart and thoughts will be with all iraqi citizens this whole week and i pray that all who can will find the courage to lead their country and their lives into an unbelievably better new era .
please , please - if you can , do try to vote .
it is the iraqi citizens right now , who are the real heroes - the real soldiers .

i fully supported the idea of not postponing the elections as it would only delay the opportunity for iraq to be governed by iraqis .
i also do not understand why muslims are killing muslims .
do these terrorists want to follow the same route saddam used to gain control of iraq ?
stanton clarke , newbury , uk american citizens , please devote some of your time in reading these articles .
then you will know how much the american media misinforms .
usuf , kannur , india my heart goes out to all the iraqis that really do want peace and a free and democratic country .
they are being so intimidated that you can not blame them for being scared to mention their names .
i would say to zeina that we want to leave iraq as bad as you want us to leave , however , we all know it would be total anarchy if we were to withdraw too soon .
but believe me , we want to leave but at the same time we want to leave the country with a government that can stand up to the terrorists .
please vote and take your country back from the terrorists and baathists who want to continue to repress the citizens .
steve , brno , czech republic this is an understatement of the difficulties in baghdad at the moment .

this is really a very serious and dangerous situation and brings disgrace on us as the occupying authority .

for two weeks , we will be publishing a range of accounts from people inside iraq about their day-to-day lives .
you can bookmark this page and come back to read the latest posts each day .
about this log the iraq log rss feed a help page on rss feeds i ca n't tell anyone i 'm a candidate posted by zeina candidate , baghdad , 24 january as a candidate in the election , i ca n't do that much .
i 'm afraid to give you my full name because if people opposed to the election find out they may come to the house and kill us .
i ca n't tell strangers that i am running in the election .
our party , the national democratic party , has more than 300 members and about 30 candidates in the election , half of whom are women .
conditions in baghdad at the moment are very poor .

for two weeks , we will be publishing a range of accounts from people inside iraq about their day-to-day lives .
you can bookmark this page and come back to read the latest posts each day .
about this log the iraq log rss feed a help page on rss feeds i ca n't tell anyone i 'm a candidate posted by zeina candidate , baghdad , 24 january as a candidate in the election , i ca n't do that much .
i 'm afraid to give you my full name because if people opposed to the election find out they may come to the house and kill us .
i ca n't tell strangers that i am running in the election .
our party , the national democratic party , has more than 300 members and about 30 candidates in the election , half of whom are women .
conditions in baghdad at the moment are very poor .
there is little electricity or gas , we have to queue for hours to get just a little bit of gas for our cars .
as you know , in baghdad there are daily bombs and many people are being killed .
you see posters of the candidates for the main parties all over baghdad .
you can even run into some of these publicly declared candidates at private meetings , but they have heavy security .
you never see them on the streets , meeting voters and campaigning in the normal way .
it 's just not safe .
it is hard to be a candidate in this election .
i do go out and meet people , but most of them are relations or friends or colleagues , one way or another .
i hope nothing terrible happens on election day .
people are praying it will go smoothly .
i think it will also be hard for people who want to vote .
people will be afraid to go to the polling stations , and given the difficulty of campaigning , people just do n't know who they are voting for .
but i and all my family will be voting - i think we can vote near where we live in the centre of baghdad .
i 'm desperate to vote .
i want a better future for my country and this will help .
i also think that sunni muslims in iraq will change their minds and vote .
they want to but are being intimidated .
if they do n't vote , they will not be represented at the centre of power and this in itself will cause problems .
unity , against the killers and bombers , is the key for iraq as a whole .
as for the us soldiers , for the time being it is good that they stay .
without them the situation would be terrible .
but , long term , they must leave .
i am a housewife at the moment , but i used to be a librarian .
if i am elected , my priority will be to change the situation of children in our society .
at the moment few have schools , or anywhere to go to play safely .
that 's my main election promise - to work to improve life for children .
read about zeina and the other log contributors comment on this post no sign of election here posted by tariq al-ani student , hit , 24 january there are many reasons why people wo n't vote where i am .
one is security - people are frightened that the polling stations could be bombed .
another reason is that people do n't feel they have a lot to gain from voting .
the shia people in the south want to vote .
they were abused under saddam hussein and hope they can gain some power in the future through the election .
on election day , i 'll be staying home with my family .
i think that 90 % of the people in hit will do the same .
after the elections in hit it will be fine , there will be no civil war , no big military operations .
people here want to keep things calm .
there is no sign that an election is about to happen in this town - there are no posters , no one talks about the election , there are no meetings or campaigning , even in private .
the whole thing is very remote for people in hit .
the situation here is bad like elsewhere .
there are shortages of basic things like gasoline .
the vast majority of people have lost their jobs .
people get by any way they can .
some have turned to crime , there is a lot of robbery and looting .
it 's safe to be out and about in hit during the day , but after sunset it gets dangerous and after midnight even more dangerous .
you do n't know where the threat is coming from , there is a lot of random shooting and you do n't know who is doing the shooting .
this has been going on for a long time .
during the day you can go to the market , you can go driving , but once it gets dark , that 's it .
as for the police , they wo n't and ca n't do much , and most of the time they are themselves hiding from trouble .
the violence here has become ordinary .
it surprises me how my family copes .
if there is a big bomb attack or a bombing by the american forces we all feel frightened , but life soon gets back to normal .
what we have a problem with in hit is internally displaced people .
when the americans attacked falluja many people moved here .
people here were against the attack on falluja and offered their assistance to people from the city .
there are deep family ties between hit and falluja .
at the time , we also were worried that the american forces would come here as well .
there are still many fallujans in hit , probably about 1,000 families altogether and we do what we can to assist them .
some are trying to get jobs here .
they 're not planning to go back to falluja any time soon .
read about tariq and the other log contributors comment on this post i am always aware that i am a target posted by elma american contractor , near mosul , 24 january i am an american woman working as a contractor in northern iraq , south of mosul .
i spent the first six months of my time here in mosul .
i had no prior experience of war , and i was n't really sure what to expect .
i still am not sure i have the words to describe what i 've witnessed these last few months .
i 've been shot at incessantly , friends of mine have been killed , and have seen far more than i ever wanted to see .
one should be careful what one asks for ; one may just get it .
anyway , these days find me in a rather quiet corner of the country - yes , there are quiet corners - a little south of mosul proper .
there is no shooting here - there is nothing at all here .
the entire facility is bounded by endless nothingness .
even so , i know i am in iraq , and i know just how dangerous this country is .
i can never truly relax here .
i know i am a target .
i fear that the future here is bleak - for us , the americans , and for the iraqis .
when i first came here i met iraqis , enjoyed speaking with them , and made friends with a few .
it has been a long time since i have seen any of them .
they have been killed , kidnapped , or simply disappeared for reasons of self-preservation .
i am afraid i am not very objective about all of this , as it is unfolding around me .
i am a part of it now , and i can only speak of what i have seen .
fairy tales begin with " once upon a time ... " and end with " ... happily ever after " .
this is n't a fairy tale .
this is a nightmare , and i do n't know when i will wake up .
the election is being advertised as a turning point for iraq - but the departure of the coalition provisional authority was supposed to be one such turning point .
read about elma and the other log contributors comment on this post these are some of the comments we have received so far about this log .
i have no understanding of what your situation is really like zeina as i live in wonderful , peaceful australia .
all i can say is that i am in awe of your courage .
i work with children and i truly hope your desire for their safety and chance to play in peace is realised .
good luck and my thoughts are with you and all those in iraq who desire to make their country a wonderful place to bring up their children .
lyn hodkinson , australia as an arab , it is disheartening and very sad to hear and watch what our brothers and sisters in iraq are going through every day .
we watch and hear of their pains but do nothing .
we send them what we can on an individual basis , but that is a drop in the ocean to what they need .
i also believe that there are many arab countries pray that the iraqi mission do not succeed and fail - as they will be next !
it is in their interest to keep the mess inside iraq like they did during the lebanese civil war .
they should learn better and stop .
mahmood abdul hussain , bahrain zeina , i 'm an american .
i write to express how much i admire your courage and i how much i admire the courage of every iraqi who votes .
please remember that under democracy , the good people will always win in the long run .
michael lusk , sunnyvale , usa i hope that many people will have the courage to vote !
they - and you , zeina , as a candidate - deserve our highest respect .
let 's hope that the bloodshed can be contained and that you will have a new beginning , which you deserve .
brigitte bischoff-doll , germany so anxious to get an unfiltered stream of info from the ordinary iraqi citizen .
thanks bbc for the service - good job !
david gebhardt , dallas , texas today , i registered for elections !
security was good , and also , i found out that to register one does not have to put one 's personal address in the list of registrants .
this is the case in all the 14 countries hosting this historic event .
it felt really good to register .
i am praying for the safety of all voters .
after sleepless nights thinking about all the complicated issues concerning elections under occupation , i have come to the conclusion that it is better to have a democracy under occupation than never !
we iraqis can start with voting , then push for real independence .
junea , toronto , canada be brave .
be strong .
do not listen to the -lrb- european -rrb- nay-sayers who would prefer iraqi people to suffer failure , rather than admit that history will prove you -lrb- and the countries who gave you this opportunity -rrb- brave and courageous and just .
hassan , new york city , usa if candidates are so afraid to contact voters and are forced to hide their identity , than of course it is not an election but a mockery of one .
democracy does not means counting some votes polled by one unknown for another unknown .
an election may only be held in a free and fair atmosphere where every person - candidate or voter - has the freedom to express his will .
smagha , new delhi , india i feel deeply sorry for the average citizen in iraq who , regardless of disposition , is being judged on extremist political and religious factors .
an american juggernaut trying to save face and a frenzied fundamentalist movement hellbent on all out holy war have turned iraq into chaos and anarchy .
vote - it 's all you can do and it 's your only hope of stability .
gareth evans , london , uk i 'm just wondering , i know some of the oil fields were burned by saddam 's men before his fall , but surely there is a lot of oil left ?
if there is a shortage of gasoline , surely this problem could be solved quickly with a little bit of help from coalition governments ?
we 're quick to give aid to the tsunami but not victims of war and oppression .
the government that is .
how much is being / will be given to help rebuild iraq ?
jonny , nottingham , uk it is sad to see that because of some fanatics many people lose their lives .
i feel sorry for the people who go around blowing themselves up to kill the innocent and hoping for a piece of heaven - this brainwashed mentality has to stop .
if only we could set our religious and cultural beliefs aside this world would be a better place .
good luck to the iraqis and strength to the us forces .
pedro , maputo , mozambique i want this election to pass without casualties , iraq was run by a brutal candidate before and this will not happen again .
a big shame for those who still do n't want democracy which will bring the peace for all iraqis. kiss , bedford , england there are certain events that will forever define a country , this first election being one of them .
the courage of any iraqi people who go and vote is inspiring to the rest of the world .
i truly do n't believe the us meant to turn your land into a frontline for fighting terrorism and the rest of the world should take note of how the majority of the people have been able to cope .
thank you for your bravery .
eric wigton , st louis , usa i do n't think many americans can truly appreciate your situation due to the sterilisation of us news media , although many of us try - this forum helps .
ultimately , though , it is your country and you have a say and a responsibility .
one man or woman alone has only hope and faith .
a country united is as strong as its people .
do the weapons of the few outnumber the faith and the hope of the masses ?
be strong .
be heard .
kevin , bellevue , usa my heart and thoughts will be with all iraqi citizens this whole week and i pray that all who can will find the courage to lead their country and their lives into an unbelievably better new era .
please , please - if you can , do try to vote .
it is the iraqi citizens right now , who are the real heroes - the real soldiers .
michael bennett , nova scotia , canada the comments from the american lady reflect what most of the contractors coming back here from iraq say - when will bush realise that emperor has no clothes ?
ken fleming , houston , texas , usa i am saddened by the number of killings leading up to the elections in iraq .
i fully supported the idea of not postponing the elections as it would only delay the opportunity for iraq to be governed by iraqis .
i also do not understand why muslims are killing muslims .
do these terrorists want to follow the same route saddam used to gain control of iraq ?
stanton clarke , newbury , uk american citizens , please devote some of your time in reading these articles .
then you will know how much the american media misinforms .
usuf , kannur , india my heart goes out to all the iraqis that really do want peace and a free and democratic country .
they are being so intimidated that you can not blame them for being scared to mention their names .
i would say to zeina that we want to leave iraq as bad as you want us to leave , however , we all know it would be total anarchy if we were to withdraw too soon .
but believe me , we want to leave but at the same time we want to leave the country with a government that can stand up to the terrorists .
please vote and take your country back from the terrorists and baathists who want to continue to repress the citizens .
steve , brno , czech republic this is an understatement of the difficulties in baghdad at the moment .
according to other sources there has been little or no running water for the past week or so .
this is really a very serious and dangerous situation and brings disgrace on us as the occupying authority .
alan murphy , cheltenham , uk it was really helpful to read the stories of people inside iraq in a day to day format without editorialising the stories .
bridget , buffalo , usa it 's too bad the country we 're supposedly " giving back to the iraqi people " has become a veritable living hell because of those very efforts .
still , good luck to every one of you .

the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers ?
we may not know when they will be released , what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming .
sony , microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months .
the details of playstation 3 , xbox 2 -lrb- codename xenon -rrb- and nintendo 's so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless . "
the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood " rory armes , ea " we know maybe what the ps3 will do , but we can only guess , " said rory armes , studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe .
" it 's a horrendous effort in the first year , " he admitted .
microsoft had delivered development kits to ea , said mr armes , but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits .
although the details may not be nailed down , mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines .
" the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood -lsb- than xbox 2 -rsb- , " he said .
great leaps " microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost , while sony has more experience in hardware .
i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost . "
next-gen developments games firms face ' tough future ' gamers could drive hdtv what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power .
it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub .
at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle .
while short on detail , he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer " great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people , more communications , more media , more connectivity " .
sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games . "
it 's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush " simon gardner , climax until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do , developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower .
gary dunn , development director at codemasters , said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles .
" we are working on new libraries of effects .
a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming , such as pixel shaders and normal mapping . "
real-world physics mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles .
" we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game . "
in the first year at least , developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines .
graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected .
simon gardner , president of climax 's action studio , said : " it 's definitely an exciting time .
we want to give more freedom to the player .
we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play .
" the environments will be much more believable and dramatic , growing and changing as you play .
" there will be a breadth of effects , more involving worlds to play in . "
ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies " gerhard florin , ea " it 's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush .
we 're being given more tools .
" for the average consumer , we can get things of a more filmic quality . "
gerhard florin , head of ea in europe , said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games .
many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely .
" ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies , " said mr florin .
he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles .
" a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros .
when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go .
' much smarter ' " it 's much smarter if you can get levels as you go . "
mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium .
" in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware , go in the opposite direction .
we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity .
" what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories . "
mr gardner agreed : " we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it does n't make for a better game then that 's not very useful . "
developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines , but how they employ them is still to be decided .

graphics on pc games such as half life 2 will be possible on the new consoles the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers ?
we may not know when they will be released , what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming .
sony , microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months .
the details of playstation 3 , xbox 2 -lrb- codename xenon -rrb- and nintendo 's so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless .
the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood rory armes , ea " we know maybe what the ps3 will do , but we can only guess , " said rory armes , studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe .
" it 's a horrendous effort in the first year , " he admitted .
microsoft had delivered development kits to ea , said mr armes , but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits .
although the details may not be nailed down , mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines .
" the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood -lsb- than xbox 2 -rsb- , " he said .
great leaps " microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost , while sony has more experience in hardware .
i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost . "
next-gen developments games firms face ' tough future ' gamers could drive hdtv what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power .
it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub .
at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle .
while short on detail , he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer " great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people , more communications , more media , more connectivity " .
sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games .
it 's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush simon gardner , climax until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do , developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower .
gary dunn , development director at codemasters , said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles .
" we are working on new libraries of effects .
a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming , such as pixel shaders and normal mapping . "
real-world physics mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles .
" we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game . "
in the first year at least , developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines .
graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected .
simon gardner , president of climax 's action studio , said : " it 's definitely an exciting time .
we want to give more freedom to the player .
we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play .
" the environments will be much more believable and dramatic , growing and changing as you play .
" there will be a breadth of effects , more involving worlds to play in .

we 're being given more tools .
" for the average consumer , we can get things of a more filmic quality . "
gerhard florin , head of ea in europe , said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games .
many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely .
" ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies , " said mr florin .
he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles .
" a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros .
when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go .
' much smarter ' " it 's much smarter if you can get levels as you go . "
mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium .
" in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware , go in the opposite direction .
we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity .
" what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories . "

graphics on pc games such as half life 2 will be possible on the new consoles the next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers ?
we may not know when they will be released , what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming .
sony , microsoft and nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months .
the details of playstation 3 , xbox 2 -lrb- codename xenon -rrb- and nintendo 's so-called revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless .
the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood rory armes , ea " we know maybe what the ps3 will do , but we can only guess , " said rory armes , studio general manager for video game giant electronic arts in europe .
" it 's a horrendous effort in the first year , " he admitted .
microsoft had delivered development kits to ea , said mr armes , but he said the company was still waiting on sony and nintendo to send kits .
although the details may not be nailed down , mr armes said ea was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines .
" the rumours are that playstation 3 will have a little more under the hood -lsb- than xbox 2 -rsb- , " he said .
great leaps " microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost , while sony has more experience in hardware .
i think sony will be able to push more into a box at cost . "
next-gen developments games firms face ' tough future ' gamers could drive hdtv what is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power .
it is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub .
at the consumer electronics show in las vegas microsoft boss bill gates said xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle .
while short on detail , he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a pc and offer " great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people , more communications , more media , more connectivity " .
sony is thought to have a similar vision for ps3 while nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games .
it 's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush simon gardner , climax until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do , developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower .
gary dunn , development director at codemasters , said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles .
" we are working on new libraries of effects .
a lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in pc gaming , such as pixel shaders and normal mapping . "
real-world physics mr dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles .
" we want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game . "
in the first year at least , developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines .
graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for pcs should be expected .
simon gardner , president of climax 's action studio , said : " it 's definitely an exciting time .
we want to give more freedom to the player .
we want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play .
" the environments will be much more believable and dramatic , growing and changing as you play .
" there will be a breadth of effects , more involving worlds to play in .
ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies gerhard florin , ea " it 's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush .
we 're being given more tools .
" for the average consumer , we can get things of a more filmic quality . "
gerhard florin , head of ea in europe , said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games .
many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely .
" ps3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies , " said mr florin .
he said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles .
" a gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros .
when he goes home he goes online and he could buy ai and levels as you go .
' much smarter ' " it 's much smarter if you can get levels as you go . "
mr armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium .
" in some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware , go in the opposite direction .
we have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity .
" what we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories . "
mr gardner agreed : " we can thrown more polygons around and have better ai but if it does n't make for a better game then that 's not very useful . "

the donation is just the latest in a line of offerings from mr gates , one of the world 's richest men .
over the past decade mr gates has made a name as one of the world 's top philanthropists , with the bill and melinda gates foundation pledging $ 7bn to good causes .
back in july 2004 , microsoft decided to return $ 75bn -lrb- £ 40.5bn -rrb- in cash to the software giant 's shareholders .
mr gates , microsoft 's billionaire co-founder and the company 's biggest shareholder , said he intended to give his estimated $ 3bn share of the payout to his charitable foundation .
set up in 2000 by mr gates and his wife melinda from the merger of two family charitable trusts , the foundation has a $ 27bn endowment and is dedicated to promoting greater equality in global health and learning .
' unconscionable disparity ' together with the british-based wellcome trust , which holds assets worth around £ 9bn , the foundation leads the world in charitable giving .
run by mr gates ' father , william h gates sr , the foundation lists one of its primary goals as " reducing the ' unconscionable disparity ' that exists between the way that we live and the way that the people of the developing world live " .
mr gates ' money could help improve the health of millions in february 2004 , the foundation pledged $ 83m to help fight tuberculosis , a disease which the world health organisation says kills nearly 2 million people a year .
in 2003 it donated $ 168m to fund research into malaria and made $ 60m available to fund research into how the risk of hiv infection among women in developing countries can be reduced .
backed by mr gates ' vast wealth - amassed by building microsoft into the world 's biggest software company - the foundation 's operations are driven by the concept of a more businesslike and hands-on approach to philanthropy .
making an impact unlike the wellcome trust , a research-funding charity which was established in 1936 following the death of sir henry wellcome , the foundation 's set-up enables its benefactor to oversee how his money is being spent .
at last year 's world economic forum in davos , mr gates told world leaders that he had a duty to ensure his wealth " goes back to global society in the most impactful way " .
the gates ' foundation endowment of $ 27bn . $ 7.1bn in grants since 1994 .
largest grant : $ 1bn to the united negro college fund .
average grant : $ 903,711 .
supports work in more than 100 countries .
since his involvement with the foundation , mr gates has become something of a " walking encyclopaedia of medical knowledge " , according to warren e buffett , the chief executive of financial services firm berkshire hathaway .
" i have heard him speak many times on this subject and each time i have been amazed by the breadth of his knowledge , " mr buffett told time magazine .
mr gates ' wife also keeps a close eye on the effectiveness of the foundation 's activities , mr buffett said .
" melinda , for her part , travels the world so that she can understand what a cheque from seattle is actually accomplishing 10,000 miles away . "
in terms of assets , the bill and melinda gates foundation dwarfs that of other well-known names in us philanthropy , such as the rockefeller foundation or the ford foundation .
long term vision in language that would not seem out of place in a modern company business plan , the gates ' foundation has pledged to " aggressively pursue a comprehensive approach " in the fight against aids .
" we must marshal the will and resources necessary to develop and distribute an aids vaccine , " mr gates has said .
the foundation is also keen to counter criticism that it focuses too much on the trouble facing other countries , and not enough on those in need in its own backyard .
almost half of the foundation 's resources are directed towards domestic us issues , according to mr gates .
the foundation 's single biggest grant - of $ 1bn - was awarded to the united negro college fund , america 's largest minority higher education assistance organisation .
the foundation also promotes access to technology in public libraries and funds groups helping to improve the lives of people in the foundation 's own corner of the us , the pacific northwest .
mr gates has said his long term vision is to improve the lives of millions of people across the globe .
it is no small order , but microsoft 's co-founder is one of the few people in the world whose money may actually be able to match his words .

the donation is just the latest in a line of offerings from mr gates , one of the world 's richest men .
over the past decade mr gates has made a name as one of the world 's top philanthropists , with the bill and melinda gates foundation pledging $ 7bn to good causes .
back in july 2004 , microsoft decided to return $ 75bn -lrb- £ 40.5bn -rrb- in cash to the software giant 's shareholders .
mr gates , microsoft 's billionaire co-founder and the company 's biggest shareholder , said he intended to give his estimated $ 3bn share of the payout to his charitable foundation .
set up in 2000 by mr gates and his wife melinda from the merger of two family charitable trusts , the foundation has a $ 27bn endowment and is dedicated to promoting greater equality in global health and learning .
' unconscionable disparity ' together with the british-based wellcome trust , which holds assets worth around £ 9bn , the foundation leads the world in charitable giving .
run by mr gates ' father , william h gates sr , the foundation lists one of its primary goals as " reducing the ' unconscionable disparity ' that exists between the way that we live and the way that the people of the developing world live " .
mr gates ' money could help improve the health of millions in february 2004 , the foundation pledged $ 83m to help fight tuberculosis , a disease which the world health organisation says kills nearly 2 million people a year .
in 2003 it donated $ 168m to fund research into malaria and made $ 60m available to fund research into how the risk of hiv infection among women in developing countries can be reduced .
backed by mr gates ' vast wealth - amassed by building microsoft into the world 's biggest software company - the foundation 's operations are driven by the concept of a more businesslike and hands-on approach to philanthropy .
making an impact unlike the wellcome trust , a research-funding charity which was established in 1936 following the death of sir henry wellcome , the foundation 's set-up enables its benefactor to oversee how his money is being spent .
at last year 's world economic forum in davos , mr gates told world leaders that he had a duty to ensure his wealth " goes back to global society in the most impactful way " .
the gates ' foundation endowment of $ 27bn . $ 7.1bn in grants since 1994 .
largest grant : $ 1bn to the united negro college fund .
average grant : $ 903,711 .
supports work in more than 100 countries .
since his involvement with the foundation , mr gates has become something of a " walking encyclopaedia of medical knowledge " , according to warren e buffett , the chief executive of financial services firm berkshire hathaway .
" i have heard him speak many times on this subject and each time i have been amazed by the breadth of his knowledge , " mr buffett told time magazine .
mr gates ' wife also keeps a close eye on the effectiveness of the foundation 's activities , mr buffett said .
" melinda , for her part , travels the world so that she can understand what a cheque from seattle is actually accomplishing 10,000 miles away . "
in terms of assets , the bill and melinda gates foundation dwarfs that of other well-known names in us philanthropy , such as the rockefeller foundation or the ford foundation .
long term vision in language that would not seem out of place in a modern company business plan , the gates ' foundation has pledged to " aggressively pursue a comprehensive approach " in the fight against aids .
" we must marshal the will and resources necessary to develop and distribute an aids vaccine , " mr gates has said .
