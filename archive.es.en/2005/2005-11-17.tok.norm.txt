the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell .

a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .
a goal by sanli , his third of the night in the 89th minute was not enough and switzerland survived the final four minutes of stoppage time to hold on for the win . spa n ish a n d czechs rou n d out europea n s while perhaps not as thrilling - or precarious - spanish and czech fans had reasons to delight as well after their teams did what was necessary to advance .
spain had whipped slovakia 5-1 in the first leg on saturday and was able to cruise to germany with a 1-1 tie in bratislava on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though frei -lrb- center , back -rrb- passed up two other golden chances , his 1st minute penalty helped push his country through thomas rosiscky 's first half goal was enough for the czech republic , which won 1-0 against norway .
the czechs won 2-0 on aggregate after a first leg win in oslo and became the 32nd , and final team to qualify . the european teams by far did not provide all of the drama .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

the confirmed death makes china the fifth country to report human deaths from h5n1 . fears of a bird flu pandemic in europe , however , seem to have subsided if the demand for poultry is anything to go by .
while the virus has dropped from the main news agenda , poultry consumption and sales have returned to pre-scare levels in most countries . germany , britain and the netherlands have all recorded domestic sales in the vicinity of normal levels this week after pandemic predictions last month severely dented business .
sales of poultry fell sharply when it was announced that the h5n1 strain had arrived in europe in october with cases confirmed in romania and croatia . germa n co n sumers stay loyal to poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans believe poultry to be safe .
in germany and britain specifically , poultry sales are now normal . " sales are stable with the normal seasonal swings , " said german poultry industry association zdg spokesman thomas janning in a statement carried by reuters .
" german consumers have reacted differently than in other european countries and have stayed loyal to poultry as they realize it is completely safe . " british consumers are also returning to the poultry section of supermarkets as the scare subsides in the uk . " i think hopefully it is something that is dying down and sales are getting back to normal , " said charles bourns , chairman of the poultry board at britain 's national farmers union . " we are very much back on track , " said nick agarwal , spokesman for uk supermarket chain asda , a unit of wal-mart stores . british supermarkets tesco and sainsbury also reported poultry sales were at normal levels .
" we are not seeing a significant impact on sales or changes in customer buying habits , " a tesco spokeswoman told reuters . while the germans , british and dutch markets are recovering , those in france , italy and hungary remain below pre-scare levels although some recovery has been noted . fra n ce records slight recovery after dip i n sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is europe 's largest poultry market .
france 's poultry industry is the largest in europe with an annual turnover of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.20 billion -rrb- .
over the past month , sales in the french retail trade were 25 percent down in the week ended october 22 but have begun to recover in the last two weeks . " sales in the week ending nov .
5 were 15 percent down on last year which is clearly an improvement , " said veronique legoff , spokeswoman for the french retail federation fcd . coldiretti , the italian farmers ' federation , said at the weekend that poultry sales were still below normal levels but slight increases in the weekly price of poultry after months of decline may be an indication that demand may be starting to recover .
sales of poultry meat in italy have slumped by up to 60 percent and coldiretti estimated that the costs of the bird flu scare for the industry stood at around 400 million euros . some retur n to tradi n g n ormality i n hu n gary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outbreak in romania has damaged hungary 's poultry exports .
meanwhile in hungary , sales were down around 10 to 15 percent compared to levels before bird flu arrived in nearby romania . while some european countries have yet to resume poultry trading with hungary due to the close proximity to the romanian outbreak , sales to switzerland and britain are slowly resuming , according to a statement from istvan erdelyi , spokesperson for hungary 's poultry product council . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global experts devise action plan to fight bird flu experts at a global conference in geneva have acted with unprecedented speed to agree on an aggressive blueprint to tackle bird flu , and strengthen plans to cope with a possible pandemic among humans .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south . " this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .
this comes just three months before the 2006 winter games in turin where coca cola is one of the main sponsors . city council officials said the measure was pushed through by communist deputies who accuse the company of abusing its workers in south america . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?

dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .
after all , in istanbul in 2000 two english soccer fans were knifed .
in istanbul , after winning against the turks to qualify for the 2003 european championship , members of germany 's under-21 national team felt the brunt of turkish disappointment and were beaten up on the way to the locker rooms .
even the game 's referee was hurt and had to get stitches on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad loser : turkish coach fatih terim gestures towards referee frank de bleeckere perhaps it 's too much to expect fairness and respect for the opponent from the passionate turkish fans .
but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .
otherwise , turkish soccer will surely continue to garner bad news , such as this : in early november , the european soccer association uefa at an early stage already rejected turkey 's application to host the 2012 european championship . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence mars world cup qualifying swiss , czech and spanish soccer fans are in ecstasy after their soccer teams became the last european teams to qualify for the world cup wednesday .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south . " this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .
this comes just three months before the 2006 winter games in turin where coca cola is one of the main sponsors . city council officials said the measure was pushed through by communist deputies who accuse the company of abusing its workers in south america . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .

" we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .

critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .
a goal by sanli , his third of the night in the 89th minute was not enough and switzerland survived the final four minutes of stoppage time to hold on for the win . spa n ish a n d czechs rou n d out europea n s while perhaps not as thrilling - or precarious - spanish and czech fans had reasons to delight as well after their teams did what was necessary to advance .
spain had whipped slovakia 5-1 in the first leg on saturday and was able to cruise to germany with a 1-1 tie in bratislava on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though frei -lrb- center , back -rrb- passed up two other golden chances , his 1st minute penalty helped push his country through thomas rosiscky 's first half goal was enough for the czech republic , which won 1-0 against norway .
the czechs won 2-0 on aggregate after a first leg win in oslo and became the 32nd , and final team to qualify . the european teams by far did not provide all of the drama .
australia qualified for the world cup for the first time in 32 years and tiny trinidad & tobago qualified for their first world cup ever earlier on wednesday . some firsts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trinidad and tobago 's ian cox , left , and russell latapy , center , and chris birchall celebrate their country 's first ever world cup appearance the " socceroos " overcame a 0-1 first leg against uruguay to win 4-2 on penalty kicks .

" i 'm so proud of the players and for the people of the whole country , " said tobago coach leo beenhakker , a former coach at real madrid , who transformed a team of soccer journeyman into world cup qualifiers . who trinidad & tobago - and the rest of the qualifying nations - will play in next june 's world cup will be revealed at the tournament seeding on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italian election campaigns turn cut-throat out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south . " this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .
this comes just three months before the 2006 winter games in turin where coca cola is one of the main sponsors . city council officials said the measure was pushed through by communist deputies who accuse the company of abusing its workers in south america . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?

the confirmed death makes china the fifth country to report human deaths from h5n1 . fears of a bird flu pandemic in europe , however , seem to have subsided if the demand for poultry is anything to go by .
while the virus has dropped from the main news agenda , poultry consumption and sales have returned to pre-scare levels in most countries . germany , britain and the netherlands have all recorded domestic sales in the vicinity of normal levels this week after pandemic predictions last month severely dented business .
sales of poultry fell sharply when it was announced that the h5n1 strain had arrived in europe in october with cases confirmed in romania and croatia . germa n co n sumers stay loyal to poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans believe poultry to be safe .
in germany and britain specifically , poultry sales are now normal . " sales are stable with the normal seasonal swings , " said german poultry industry association zdg spokesman thomas janning in a statement carried by reuters .
" german consumers have reacted differently than in other european countries and have stayed loyal to poultry as they realize it is completely safe . " british consumers are also returning to the poultry section of supermarkets as the scare subsides in the uk . " i think hopefully it is something that is dying down and sales are getting back to normal , " said charles bourns , chairman of the poultry board at britain 's national farmers union . " we are very much back on track , " said nick agarwal , spokesman for uk supermarket chain asda , a unit of wal-mart stores . british supermarkets tesco and sainsbury also reported poultry sales were at normal levels .
" we are not seeing a significant impact on sales or changes in customer buying habits , " a tesco spokeswoman told reuters . while the germans , british and dutch markets are recovering , those in france , italy and hungary remain below pre-scare levels although some recovery has been noted . fra n ce records slight recovery after dip i n sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is europe 's largest poultry market .

the confirmed death makes china the fifth country to report human deaths from h5n1 . fears of a bird flu pandemic in europe , however , seem to have subsided if the demand for poultry is anything to go by .
while the virus has dropped from the main news agenda , poultry consumption and sales have returned to pre-scare levels in most countries . germany , britain and the netherlands have all recorded domestic sales in the vicinity of normal levels this week after pandemic predictions last month severely dented business .
sales of poultry fell sharply when it was announced that the h5n1 strain had arrived in europe in october with cases confirmed in romania and croatia . germa n co n sumers stay loyal to poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans believe poultry to be safe .
in germany and britain specifically , poultry sales are now normal . " sales are stable with the normal seasonal swings , " said german poultry industry association zdg spokesman thomas janning in a statement carried by reuters .
" german consumers have reacted differently than in other european countries and have stayed loyal to poultry as they realize it is completely safe . " british consumers are also returning to the poultry section of supermarkets as the scare subsides in the uk . " i think hopefully it is something that is dying down and sales are getting back to normal , " said charles bourns , chairman of the poultry board at britain 's national farmers union . " we are very much back on track , " said nick agarwal , spokesman for uk supermarket chain asda , a unit of wal-mart stores . british supermarkets tesco and sainsbury also reported poultry sales were at normal levels .
" we are not seeing a significant impact on sales or changes in customer buying habits , " a tesco spokeswoman told reuters . while the germans , british and dutch markets are recovering , those in france , italy and hungary remain below pre-scare levels although some recovery has been noted . fra n ce records slight recovery after dip i n sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is europe 's largest poultry market .
france 's poultry industry is the largest in europe with an annual turnover of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.20 billion -rrb- .
over the past month , sales in the french retail trade were 25 percent down in the week ended october 22 but have begun to recover in the last two weeks . " sales in the week ending nov .

sales of poultry meat in italy have slumped by up to 60 percent and coldiretti estimated that the costs of the bird flu scare for the industry stood at around 400 million euros . some retur n to tradi n g n ormality i n hu n gary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outbreak in romania has damaged hungary 's poultry exports .
meanwhile in hungary , sales were down around 10 to 15 percent compared to levels before bird flu arrived in nearby romania . while some european countries have yet to resume poultry trading with hungary due to the close proximity to the romanian outbreak , sales to switzerland and britain are slowly resuming , according to a statement from istvan erdelyi , spokesperson for hungary 's poultry product council . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de global experts devise action plan to fight bird flu experts at a global conference in geneva have acted with unprecedented speed to agree on an aggressive blueprint to tackle bird flu , and strengthen plans to cope with a possible pandemic among humans .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .
a goal by sanli , his third of the night in the 89th minute was not enough and switzerland survived the final four minutes of stoppage time to hold on for the win . spa n ish a n d czechs rou n d out europea n s while perhaps not as thrilling - or precarious - spanish and czech fans had reasons to delight as well after their teams did what was necessary to advance .
spain had whipped slovakia 5-1 in the first leg on saturday and was able to cruise to germany with a 1-1 tie in bratislava on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though frei -lrb- center , back -rrb- passed up two other golden chances , his 1st minute penalty helped push his country through thomas rosiscky 's first half goal was enough for the czech republic , which won 1-0 against norway .
the czechs won 2-0 on aggregate after a first leg win in oslo and became the 32nd , and final team to qualify . the european teams by far did not provide all of the drama .
australia qualified for the world cup for the first time in 32 years and tiny trinidad & tobago qualified for their first world cup ever earlier on wednesday . some firsts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trinidad and tobago 's ian cox , left , and russell latapy , center , and chris birchall celebrate their country 's first ever world cup appearance the " socceroos " overcame a 0-1 first leg against uruguay to win 4-2 on penalty kicks .

but it also called for the establishment of an international forum that will give the more than 100 governments that signed it a stronger voice in internet policy issues in the coming years . the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end , " wrote the european union in a statement . lo n g-term solutio n " in the short term , us oversight is not immediately challenged , " an eu source told reuters .
" but in the long term they are under obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of internet governance .

washington also cited growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control . rather than withdraw from icann in 2006 , as it had originally planned , the department of commerce decided to stay on , frustrating eu officials and leading pundits to predict a clash during this week 's summit .
pressure on the us to relent its involvement in icann has been brewing since the first summit in 2003 in geneva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under us control until further notice diplomats and officials from both sides praised the agreement .

germany , which last week delayed the decision , may finally back it - but at a price . the european parliament on thursday will debate a landmark piece of legislation to test and register thousands of chemicals produced and imported into the eu . called reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals -rrb- , the bill is designed to protect consumers from the adverse effects of chemicals found in a wide range of products from soap powder , children 's toys , pesticides to building materials . the new rules , which have been under discussion for over two years , would also clamp down on the use of animals to test new chemicals . under the terms of reach , chemical companies will have to register all chemicals used with a central eu database and provide information about them and potential hazards .
those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life .

but it also called for the establishment of an international forum that will give the more than 100 governments that signed it a stronger voice in internet policy issues in the coming years . the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end , " wrote the european union in a statement . lo n g-term solutio n " in the short term , us oversight is not immediately challenged , " an eu source told reuters .
" but in the long term they are under obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of internet governance . " the agreement , reached just before the beginning of the three-day world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia , ended three years of debate on the sticky issue of internet governance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking a central server twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . feud three years i n the maki n g the us said its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cited growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control . rather than withdraw from icann in 2006 , as it had originally planned , the department of commerce decided to stay on , frustrating eu officials and leading pundits to predict a clash during this week 's summit .
pressure on the us to relent its involvement in icann has been brewing since the first summit in 2003 in geneva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under us control until further notice diplomats and officials from both sides praised the agreement .
but editorialists said the deal did nothing but delay confrontation on easing america 's control over the internet . " a world wide web should also be in the world 's control - not the only world power , " wrote the hamburger abe n dblatt .
" the decision of what really happens in the internet continues to be made by icann .
it wo n't be long before the problem is once again on the agenda of a world summit .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south . " this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .
this comes just three months before the 2006 winter games in turin where coca cola is one of the main sponsors . city council officials said the measure was pushed through by communist deputies who accuse the company of abusing its workers in south america . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.11.2005 referee gets jail time for match fixing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former referee hoyzer will spend time behind bars former referee robert hoyzer , who admitted fixing top matches in return for bribes from a croatian mafia ring , was sentenced to two years and five months in jail on thursday .
the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 17.11.2005 opinion : the real soccer scandal in istanbul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss had to have police protection the soccer world is in an uproar in the wake of the beating the swiss national team took from their turkish opponents .
dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .
after all , in istanbul in 2000 two english soccer fans were knifed .
in istanbul , after winning against the turks to qualify for the 2003 european championship , members of germany 's under-21 national team felt the brunt of turkish disappointment and were beaten up on the way to the locker rooms .
even the game 's referee was hurt and had to get stitches on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad loser : turkish coach fatih terim gestures towards referee frank de bleeckere perhaps it 's too much to expect fairness and respect for the opponent from the passionate turkish fans .
but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .
otherwise , turkish soccer will surely continue to garner bad news , such as this : in early november , the european soccer association uefa at an early stage already rejected turkey 's application to host the 2012 european championship . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence mars world cup qualifying swiss , czech and spanish soccer fans are in ecstasy after their soccer teams became the last european teams to qualify for the world cup wednesday .

but how 's their sex life ?
riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : italy takes to the polls italian election campaigns turn cut-throat out with the old , in with the new as angie meets silvio italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?
the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

but how 's their sex life ?
riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .
she needs love , romance , caresses and foreplay .
slam bam , thank ya ma 'am is not her idea of a good time .
she tells her boyfriend that , but he does n't quite get it . has n't she been wanting more sex , he asks ?
well yeah , she counters , but she needs a little tlc in the bedroom along with all the bump and grind . have you been in this situation before , girls ? what 's bayer 's role in all this , one wonders ?
it 's unclear , although bayer is one of the companies behind levitra , an erectile dysfunction drug along the lines of viagra . if you click on the bayer logo at the bottom of the web site , you 're directed to a site for professional sex coaching .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

" this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable . "

in germany and britain specifically , poultry sales are now normal . " sales are stable with the normal seasonal swings , " said german poultry industry association zdg spokesman thomas janning in a statement carried by reuters .
" german consumers have reacted differently than in other european countries and have stayed loyal to poultry as they realize it is completely safe . " british consumers are also returning to the poultry section of supermarkets as the scare subsides in the uk . " i think hopefully it is something that is dying down and sales are getting back to normal , " said charles bourns , chairman of the poultry board at britain 's national farmers union . " we are very much back on track , " said nick agarwal , spokesman for uk supermarket chain asda , a unit of wal-mart stores . british supermarkets tesco and sainsbury also reported poultry sales were at normal levels .
" we are not seeing a significant impact on sales or changes in customer buying habits , " a tesco spokeswoman told reuters . while the germans , british and dutch markets are recovering , those in france , italy and hungary remain below pre-scare levels although some recovery has been noted . fra n ce records slight recovery after dip i n sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is europe 's largest poultry market .

but it also called for the establishment of an international forum that will give the more than 100 governments that signed it a stronger voice in internet policy issues in the coming years . the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end , " wrote the european union in a statement . lo n g-term solutio n " in the short term , us oversight is not immediately challenged , " an eu source told reuters .
" but in the long term they are under obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of internet governance .

theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . feud three years i n the maki n g the us said its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cited growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control . rather than withdraw from icann in 2006 , as it had originally planned , the department of commerce decided to stay on , frustrating eu officials and leading pundits to predict a clash during this week 's summit .
pressure on the us to relent its involvement in icann has been brewing since the first summit in 2003 in geneva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under us control until further notice diplomats and officials from both sides praised the agreement .
but editorialists said the deal did nothing but delay confrontation on easing america 's control over the internet . " a world wide web should also be in the world 's control - not the only world power , " wrote the hamburger abe n dblatt .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .
a goal by sanli , his third of the night in the 89th minute was not enough and switzerland survived the final four minutes of stoppage time to hold on for the win . spa n ish a n d czechs rou n d out europea n s while perhaps not as thrilling - or precarious - spanish and czech fans had reasons to delight as well after their teams did what was necessary to advance .

the czechs won 2-0 on aggregate after a first leg win in oslo and became the 32nd , and final team to qualify . the european teams by far did not provide all of the drama .
australia qualified for the world cup for the first time in 32 years and tiny trinidad & tobago qualified for their first world cup ever earlier on wednesday . some firsts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trinidad and tobago 's ian cox , left , and russell latapy , center , and chris birchall celebrate their country 's first ever world cup appearance the " socceroos " overcame a 0-1 first leg against uruguay to win 4-2 on penalty kicks .
goalie david schwarz is assured of a place in australian soccer history after parrying two of the uruguayan penalty kicks . trinidad & tobago - with a population of 1.1 million - will be the smallest nation in the world cup after beating bahrain 1-0 , and going through on a 2-1 aggregate score after tying in the first leg . " i 'm so proud of the players and for the people of the whole country , " said tobago coach leo beenhakker , a former coach at real madrid , who transformed a team of soccer journeyman into world cup qualifiers . who trinidad & tobago - and the rest of the qualifying nations - will play in next june 's world cup will be revealed at the tournament seeding on dec .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .
" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

" this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .

as a forerunner to the 2006 world cup , germany staged the clash of the global zone titans in a tournament of champions .
the best from europe , asia , africa , south america and oceania came to the home of the world cup hosts to do battle over the course of two weeks for the title of confederations champion .

here are the results ... dw-world.de confed cup : from riyadh to the world from a three-team invitation tournament to an intercontinental " champion of champions " competition , the confederations cup has steadily grown into one of soccer 's most prestigious international events .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- the confederations cup comes to germany the fifa 2005 confederations cup kicks off in germany on june 15 , bringing the leading teams from the world 's six soccer federations together to compete for the title of champion of champions .

dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .

whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .

riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .

it 's unclear , although bayer is one of the companies behind levitra , an erectile dysfunction drug along the lines of viagra . if you click on the bayer logo at the bottom of the web site , you 're directed to a site for professional sex coaching .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable . "
thursday 's verdict comes just before the draw for the world cup groupings and opening matches for what is supposed to be the finest hour in german football . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de alleged ringleader recalls hoyzer 's greed disgraced referee robert hoyzer was driven by greed and the lust for power , according to the man who is alleged to be the ringleader behind the german soccer match rigging scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.11.2005 referee gets jail time for match fixing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former referee hoyzer will spend time behind bars former referee robert hoyzer , who admitted fixing top matches in return for bribes from a croatian mafia ring , was sentenced to two years and five months in jail on thursday .
the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .

whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .

but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .
after all , in istanbul in 2000 two english soccer fans were knifed .
in istanbul , after winning against the turks to qualify for the 2003 european championship , members of germany 's under-21 national team felt the brunt of turkish disappointment and were beaten up on the way to the locker rooms .
even the game 's referee was hurt and had to get stitches on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad loser : turkish coach fatih terim gestures towards referee frank de bleeckere perhaps it 's too much to expect fairness and respect for the opponent from the passionate turkish fans .
but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .
otherwise , turkish soccer will surely continue to garner bad news , such as this : in early november , the european soccer association uefa at an early stage already rejected turkey 's application to host the 2012 european championship . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence mars world cup qualifying swiss , czech and spanish soccer fans are in ecstasy after their soccer teams became the last european teams to qualify for the world cup wednesday .

riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .

but it also called for the establishment of an international forum that will give the more than 100 governments that signed it a stronger voice in internet policy issues in the coming years . the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end , " wrote the european union in a statement . lo n g-term solutio n " in the short term , us oversight is not immediately challenged , " an eu source told reuters .
" but in the long term they are under obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of internet governance . " the agreement , reached just before the beginning of the three-day world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia , ended three years of debate on the sticky issue of internet governance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking a central server twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . feud three years i n the maki n g the us said its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cited growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control . rather than withdraw from icann in 2006 , as it had originally planned , the department of commerce decided to stay on , frustrating eu officials and leading pundits to predict a clash during this week 's summit .
pressure on the us to relent its involvement in icann has been brewing since the first summit in 2003 in geneva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under us control until further notice diplomats and officials from both sides praised the agreement .
but editorialists said the deal did nothing but delay confrontation on easing america 's control over the internet . " a world wide web should also be in the world 's control - not the only world power , " wrote the hamburger abe n dblatt .
" the decision of what really happens in the internet continues to be made by icann .
it wo n't be long before the problem is once again on the agenda of a world summit .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .
a goal by sanli , his third of the night in the 89th minute was not enough and switzerland survived the final four minutes of stoppage time to hold on for the win . spa n ish a n d czechs rou n d out europea n s while perhaps not as thrilling - or precarious - spanish and czech fans had reasons to delight as well after their teams did what was necessary to advance .
spain had whipped slovakia 5-1 in the first leg on saturday and was able to cruise to germany with a 1-1 tie in bratislava on wednesday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though frei -lrb- center , back -rrb- passed up two other golden chances , his 1st minute penalty helped push his country through thomas rosiscky 's first half goal was enough for the czech republic , which won 1-0 against norway .
the czechs won 2-0 on aggregate after a first leg win in oslo and became the 32nd , and final team to qualify . the european teams by far did not provide all of the drama .
australia qualified for the world cup for the first time in 32 years and tiny trinidad & tobago qualified for their first world cup ever earlier on wednesday . some firsts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trinidad and tobago 's ian cox , left , and russell latapy , center , and chris birchall celebrate their country 's first ever world cup appearance the " socceroos " overcame a 0-1 first leg against uruguay to win 4-2 on penalty kicks .
goalie david schwarz is assured of a place in australian soccer history after parrying two of the uruguayan penalty kicks . trinidad & tobago - with a population of 1.1 million - will be the smallest nation in the world cup after beating bahrain 1-0 , and going through on a 2-1 aggregate score after tying in the first leg . " i 'm so proud of the players and for the people of the whole country , " said tobago coach leo beenhakker , a former coach at real madrid , who transformed a team of soccer journeyman into world cup qualifiers . who trinidad & tobago - and the rest of the qualifying nations - will play in next june 's world cup will be revealed at the tournament seeding on dec .

critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .

" it 's an attempt to deform the country ’ s democratic structures . ” more power to regions prime minister silvio berlusconi insists that the reform would help to make italy ’ s governmental system more effective by granting the regions full autonomy on decisions of health , schooling and policing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian senate debates the constitutional reform the upper house of parliament , the senate , would become a federal legislative body while the prime minister would be able to hire and fire ministers and to dissolve parliament .
observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

germany , which last week delayed the decision , may finally back it - but at a price . the european parliament on thursday will debate a landmark piece of legislation to test and register thousands of chemicals produced and imported into the eu . called reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals -rrb- , the bill is designed to protect consumers from the adverse effects of chemicals found in a wide range of products from soap powder , children 's toys , pesticides to building materials . the new rules , which have been under discussion for over two years , would also clamp down on the use of animals to test new chemicals . under the terms of reach , chemical companies will have to register all chemicals used with a central eu database and provide information about them and potential hazards .
those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.11.2005 referee gets jail time for match fixing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former referee hoyzer will spend time behind bars former referee robert hoyzer , who admitted fixing top matches in return for bribes from a croatian mafia ring , was sentenced to two years and five months in jail on thursday .
the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 17.11.2005 opinion : the real soccer scandal in istanbul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss had to have police protection the soccer world is in an uproar in the wake of the beating the swiss national team took from their turkish opponents .
dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .
after all , in istanbul in 2000 two english soccer fans were knifed .
in istanbul , after winning against the turks to qualify for the 2003 european championship , members of germany 's under-21 national team felt the brunt of turkish disappointment and were beaten up on the way to the locker rooms .
even the game 's referee was hurt and had to get stitches on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad loser : turkish coach fatih terim gestures towards referee frank de bleeckere perhaps it 's too much to expect fairness and respect for the opponent from the passionate turkish fans .
but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .
otherwise , turkish soccer will surely continue to garner bad news , such as this : in early november , the european soccer association uefa at an early stage already rejected turkey 's application to host the 2012 european championship . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence mars world cup qualifying swiss , czech and spanish soccer fans are in ecstasy after their soccer teams became the last european teams to qualify for the world cup wednesday .

those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life . " some of these chemicals , but we do not know which , almost certainly pose unacceptable risks to ourselves and our children , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .

but it also called for the establishment of an international forum that will give the more than 100 governments that signed it a stronger voice in internet policy issues in the coming years . the agreement would lead to " further internationalization of internet governance , and enhanced intergovernmental cooperation to this end , " wrote the european union in a statement . lo n g-term solutio n " in the short term , us oversight is not immediately challenged , " an eu source told reuters .
" but in the long term they are under obligation to negotiate with all the states about the future and evolution of internet governance . " the agreement , reached just before the beginning of the three-day world summit on the information society in tunis , tunisia , ended three years of debate on the sticky issue of internet governance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking a central server twelve of the 13 root servers that make the internet run are located in the united states .
though icann is a private organization with international board members , the commerce department can still veto what goes on government -approved lists of the 260 or so internet suffixes , like " .com. "
theoretically , the us could simply disconnect the domains of countries , like iran or north korea , with which they are feuding . feud three years i n the maki n g the us said its historic role in the development and expansion of the world wide web gives it the right to maintain such control .
washington also cited growing security threats and the increasing use of the internet in global communications and commerce as reasons for the country to retain control . rather than withdraw from icann in 2006 , as it had originally planned , the department of commerce decided to stay on , frustrating eu officials and leading pundits to predict a clash during this week 's summit .
pressure on the us to relent its involvement in icann has been brewing since the first summit in 2003 in geneva . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under us control until further notice diplomats and officials from both sides praised the agreement .
but editorialists said the deal did nothing but delay confrontation on easing america 's control over the internet . " a world wide web should also be in the world 's control - not the only world power , " wrote the hamburger abe n dblatt .
" the decision of what really happens in the internet continues to be made by icann .

the rise and fall of silvio berlusconi europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 italian senate votes to overhaul constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian leader silvio berlusconi has been a major backer of the reform italy ’ s senate has passed a controversial bill that could lead to a major overhaul of the country ’ s constitution .
critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .
what we are effectively witnessing is the burial of constitution .
the people who are behind this know exactly what they are doing , ” said former president oscar luigi scalfaro . promotes division ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parma , northern italy opponents of the reform say the measures it contains will simply confirm the wealth gap between the rich industrial northern regions - the heartland of bossi 's party - and the under-developed south . " this reform undermines social cohesion and reduces the ability to govern the country .
what bossi has obtained is not devolution , but dissolution , " said antonio di pietro , a former anti-corruption magistrate who now heads the small italy of values opposition party . meanwhile , in a further political development , this time on a local level , the city council of turin voted to ban coca-cola products from its offices .
this comes just three months before the 2006 winter games in turin where coca cola is one of the main sponsors . city council officials said the measure was pushed through by communist deputies who accuse the company of abusing its workers in south america . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy 's berlusconi in trouble ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.11.2005 referee gets jail time for match fixing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former referee hoyzer will spend time behind bars former referee robert hoyzer , who admitted fixing top matches in return for bribes from a croatian mafia ring , was sentenced to two years and five months in jail on thursday .
the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 17.11.2005 opinion : the real soccer scandal in istanbul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss had to have police protection the soccer world is in an uproar in the wake of the beating the swiss national team took from their turkish opponents .
dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .
after all , in istanbul in 2000 two english soccer fans were knifed .
in istanbul , after winning against the turks to qualify for the 2003 european championship , members of germany 's under-21 national team felt the brunt of turkish disappointment and were beaten up on the way to the locker rooms .
even the game 's referee was hurt and had to get stitches on his head . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad loser : turkish coach fatih terim gestures towards referee frank de bleeckere perhaps it 's too much to expect fairness and respect for the opponent from the passionate turkish fans .
but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .
otherwise , turkish soccer will surely continue to garner bad news , such as this : in early november , the european soccer association uefa at an early stage already rejected turkey 's application to host the 2012 european championship . oliver samson -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence mars world cup qualifying swiss , czech and spanish soccer fans are in ecstasy after their soccer teams became the last european teams to qualify for the world cup wednesday .
but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence .

17 , 2005 -rrb- world cup security gives terror priority hooliganism has long been the bane of those organizing security for the 2006 world cup but germany 's police union chief has turned the attention to the terror threat on such an " attractive " target .

dw 's oliver samson says the turks ' behavior should n't be tolerated . european soccer has a new scandal : players beaten , trainers punched , journalists physically prevented from doing their work .
it 's only right that the soccer world of is outraged over the events en route to the locker rooms after turkey ultimately failed to qualify for the world cup in its game against switzerland .
but no one should be surprised - or if so , only because it was n't worse . the kicks and punches , the harassment of the swiss team at istanbul airport , the eggs and stones the turks threw at the swiss team 's bus - they have a prehistory .
and it is the real scandal .
bildunterschrift : " welcome to hell " reads the turkish fans ' banner it started the previous weekend in basel .
when the whistle was finally blown on the first leg a disappointed 0-2 loss for the turks , a whole chorus of agitators decided to play with people 's emotions .
an unholy alliance of trainer fatih terim , officials and journalists developed conspiracy theories and whipped up alleged injuries to turkish honor - all with the aim of pumping a bit more passion into the team and the spectators for the second leg in istanbul .
and at the head of the provocateurs was the turkish team 's ultra-nationalistic manager , davut disli . nothing could be more wrong than to dismiss it all as turkish soccer folklore , thus playing it down .
starting a downright hate campaign against switzerland ahead of this critical game is a sign of criminal irresponsibility .

but you must be able to expect turkish soccer team officials not to further incite the fans .
whether a draconic penalty from world soccer association fifa - such as excluding the turks from the next world cup - would be conducive to positive developments in turkish soccer is an open question .
germany wo n't get a chance to welcome the turkish team to the 2006 world cup as it is - certainly the biggest surprise of the qualifiers in the first place .
in terms of sport , it 's a great loss - after all , turkey made headlines when it made it to third place in the last world cup . turkey 's route to the top of world soccer has been cut off for the time being .
perhaps it 's an opportunity for turkish soccer - riddled by corruption as it is - to consider a change of mentality .

but how 's their sex life ?
riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .
she needs love , romance , caresses and foreplay .
slam bam , thank ya ma 'am is not her idea of a good time .
she tells her boyfriend that , but he does n't quite get it . has n't she been wanting more sex , he asks ?
well yeah , she counters , but she needs a little tlc in the bedroom along with all the bump and grind . have you been in this situation before , girls ? what 's bayer 's role in all this , one wonders ?
it 's unclear , although bayer is one of the companies behind levitra , an erectile dysfunction drug along the lines of viagra . if you click on the bayer logo at the bottom of the web site , you 're directed to a site for professional sex coaching .
so , if diana and her erotic travails do n't provide the solution to your sexual frustration , the site tells you how to bring in the heavy hitters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ex-porn star wild no more former porn star michaela schaffrath has long been trying to make it as a serious actor .
her latest hope is to avoid association with her saucy screen days by shedding her pseudonym .

3 , 2005 -rrb- scoring in the soccer love shack next year 's soccer world cup will be a boon to a host of german businesses , not least , the sex trade .

but how 's their sex life ?
riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .
she needs love , romance , caresses and foreplay .
slam bam , thank ya ma 'am is not her idea of a good time .
she tells her boyfriend that , but he does n't quite get it . has n't she been wanting more sex , he asks ?
well yeah , she counters , but she needs a little tlc in the bedroom along with all the bump and grind . have you been in this situation before , girls ? what 's bayer 's role in all this , one wonders ?
it 's unclear , although bayer is one of the companies behind levitra , an erectile dysfunction drug along the lines of viagra . if you click on the bayer logo at the bottom of the web site , you 're directed to a site for professional sex coaching .

the confirmed death makes china the fifth country to report human deaths from h5n1 . fears of a bird flu pandemic in europe , however , seem to have subsided if the demand for poultry is anything to go by .
while the virus has dropped from the main news agenda , poultry consumption and sales have returned to pre-scare levels in most countries . germany , britain and the netherlands have all recorded domestic sales in the vicinity of normal levels this week after pandemic predictions last month severely dented business .
sales of poultry fell sharply when it was announced that the h5n1 strain had arrived in europe in october with cases confirmed in romania and croatia . germa n co n sumers stay loyal to poultry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans believe poultry to be safe .
in germany and britain specifically , poultry sales are now normal . " sales are stable with the normal seasonal swings , " said german poultry industry association zdg spokesman thomas janning in a statement carried by reuters .
" german consumers have reacted differently than in other european countries and have stayed loyal to poultry as they realize it is completely safe . " british consumers are also returning to the poultry section of supermarkets as the scare subsides in the uk . " i think hopefully it is something that is dying down and sales are getting back to normal , " said charles bourns , chairman of the poultry board at britain 's national farmers union . " we are very much back on track , " said nick agarwal , spokesman for uk supermarket chain asda , a unit of wal-mart stores . british supermarkets tesco and sainsbury also reported poultry sales were at normal levels .
" we are not seeing a significant impact on sales or changes in customer buying habits , " a tesco spokeswoman told reuters . while the germans , british and dutch markets are recovering , those in france , italy and hungary remain below pre-scare levels although some recovery has been noted . fra n ce records slight recovery after dip i n sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is europe 's largest poultry market .
france 's poultry industry is the largest in europe with an annual turnover of 6 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.20 billion -rrb- .
over the past month , sales in the french retail trade were 25 percent down in the week ended october 22 but have begun to recover in the last two weeks . " sales in the week ending nov .
5 were 15 percent down on last year which is clearly an improvement , " said veronique legoff , spokeswoman for the french retail federation fcd . coldiretti , the italian farmers ' federation , said at the weekend that poultry sales were still below normal levels but slight increases in the weekly price of poultry after months of decline may be an indication that demand may be starting to recover .
sales of poultry meat in italy have slumped by up to 60 percent and coldiretti estimated that the costs of the bird flu scare for the industry stood at around 400 million euros . some retur n to tradi n g n ormality i n hu n gary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outbreak in romania has damaged hungary 's poultry exports .

germany , which last week delayed the decision , may finally back it - but at a price . the european parliament on thursday will debate a landmark piece of legislation to test and register thousands of chemicals produced and imported into the eu . called reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals -rrb- , the bill is designed to protect consumers from the adverse effects of chemicals found in a wide range of products from soap powder , children 's toys , pesticides to building materials . the new rules , which have been under discussion for over two years , would also clamp down on the use of animals to test new chemicals . under the terms of reach , chemical companies will have to register all chemicals used with a central eu database and provide information about them and potential hazards .
those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life . " some of these chemicals , but we do not know which , almost certainly pose unacceptable risks to ourselves and our children , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

but the swiss triumph in turkey was marred by fan violence . soccer 's governing body fifa has threatened sanctions after swiss players were showered with objects from the stands of sukru saracoglu stadium and swiss and turkish players clashed following their aggregate victory over turkey .
the trouble started immediately after the final whistle .
swiss players sprinted for the locker rooms as objects thrown by irate turkish fans rained down . swiss defender benjamin hubbel kicked a turkish coach as he went off the field , and then jumped on turkey 's ozalan alpay after the player allegedly kicked striker marco streller . swiss defender stephane grichting was hospitalized with internal bleeding after being kicked , said swiss coach koebi kuhn . " we could not yet show our tremendous joy but it will be a great feeling very soon , " he said .
" it was one of those matches which really makes you nervous . " turkey 's 4-2 in istanbul was not enough to put them through because switzerland had one the first leg 2-0 , putting them through on aggregate points . i n te n se play o n the field as well swiss players knew the atmosphere would be tense and any last reservations must have been cleared away after turkish fans hung a banner up that read " welcome to hell . " the match was a thrilling , intense affair which saw its first goal in the first minute .
a handball penalty kick against turkey was calmly slotted into the turkish goal by swiss striker alexander frei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish soccer fans made sure the swiss knew what they were getting into the turks responded with an offensive barrage , consistently putting the swiss under pressure and eventually tying the game with a header from tuncay sanli in the 24th minute .
they added goals two and three just before and after the half , setting the stage for a thrilling finale . but instead of turkey getting the goal to put them up 4-1 and on track for germany , it was switzerland 's marco streller on a counter-attack that brought the swiss within one in the 84th minute .

critics already say the planned changes would give disproportionate powers to the prime minister . the bill has been pushed through parliament by the influential northern league party , a key member of prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right coalition .
the vote in the senate was 170 to 132 in favor , with three abstentions . the reform , the first in 60 years , would strengthen the role of the prime minister , cut the number of parliamentarians in both houses and devolve more powers to italy ’ s 20 regions . the vote seals a pact between ruling prime minister silvio berlusconi and his partners in the small but influential northern league .
the right-wing party 's leader , umberto bossi , who suffered a stroke in march 2004 , came to rome from his lombardy base for a triumphant evening for his party . the league has several times threatened to pull out of the government when it felt its partners were dragging their feet on devolution , the cause closest to the heart of bossi 's once-secessionist party . however , since the proposed changes will not come into effect before the next general election , due next april , they could still be voted down in a possible referendum . “ we will call on the public to vote against these changes , because contrary to what the government is saying , this is not a reform , " said pierro fassino , the leader of the opposition party democrats of the left .

observers say that would put an end to a typical italian practice of parties switching allegiances in mid-term , often bringing down the government in the process . while berlusconi claims that the law is the centerpiece of the government ’ s comprehensive reform plans that will lead to a more streamlined government , others are shocked at what they see as blatant attempts by the leadership to introduce “ prime ministerial dictatorship , ” as romano prodi , the opposition leader and challenger to berlusconi , put it . “ i ’ m deeply ashamed and bitter about the decision .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2005 eu warned not to water down chemicals rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill will cover chemicals found in children 's toys too the eu is set to vote on a controversial reform bill for europe 's chemical industry that could cost the industry billions .
germany , which last week delayed the decision , may finally back it - but at a price . the european parliament on thursday will debate a landmark piece of legislation to test and register thousands of chemicals produced and imported into the eu . called reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals -rrb- , the bill is designed to protect consumers from the adverse effects of chemicals found in a wide range of products from soap powder , children 's toys , pesticides to building materials . the new rules , which have been under discussion for over two years , would also clamp down on the use of animals to test new chemicals . under the terms of reach , chemical companies will have to register all chemicals used with a central eu database and provide information about them and potential hazards .
those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life . " some of these chemicals , but we do not know which , almost certainly pose unacceptable risks to ourselves and our children , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

germany , which last week delayed the decision , may finally back it - but at a price . the european parliament on thursday will debate a landmark piece of legislation to test and register thousands of chemicals produced and imported into the eu . called reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorization of chemicals -rrb- , the bill is designed to protect consumers from the adverse effects of chemicals found in a wide range of products from soap powder , children 's toys , pesticides to building materials . the new rules , which have been under discussion for over two years , would also clamp down on the use of animals to test new chemicals . under the terms of reach , chemical companies will have to register all chemicals used with a central eu database and provide information about them and potential hazards .
those considered particularly dangerous , such as carcinogens , would require authorization . chemical i n dustry puts up resista n ce expectedly , the plan has run into massive opposition from europe 's chemical industry , which fears excessive red tape and job cuts , and pitted it against green groups pushing for tough regulations to protect consumers and the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemical giants like basf are against the bill the european commission estimates that reach will cost the chemical industry 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.68 billion -rrb- over 11 years .
the chemicals industry has been lobbying lawmakers hard for rules that are not too strict . " we welcome the desire to produce an effective regulatory framework for the safe management of chemicals , " the european chemical industry council -lrb- cefic -rrb- , which represents 27,000 companies in europe , said this week . " we believe , however , that some crucial workability issues remain to be solved before the system can work in practice and achieve its objectives . " britai n wa n ts deal before e n d of term britain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the 25-nation eu , is keen to secure a deal on reach by the end of london 's turn at the eu helm on dec 31 . " this legislation offers a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection of humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of european industry , " british junior environment minister lord bach said this week . both lawmakers and members states will have to agree on a common position on the bill before it can become law . germa n y plays spoilsport last week , the bill suffered a major setback when germany , which has europe 's biggest chemical industry with companies like basf , succeeded in delaying a decision by eu states on the treaty .
germany accounts for 25 percent of the european chemical industry 's 440 billion euros turnover . with a new coalition government still being thrashed out last week , germany 's incoming government pleaded more time to debate the bill . however , environmentalists are warning that any delay could lead to a further watering down of the text to meet industry demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green groups have accused merkel of diluting reach " angela merkel -lrb- germany 's incoming chancellor -rrb- wants to weaken reach as much as possible in favor of the german chemicals industry , " greenpeace official nadia haiama said in a statement last week . berli n , brussels i n chi n g towards deal however , there are signs that berlin may actually back the deal after a reported compromise between german conservative member of parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- hartmut nassauer , in close coordination with germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel , and meps from the three main parliament factions . the nassauer package exempts 90 percent of chemicals traded in volumes of one to 10 tons per year from the full range of tests and introduces restrictions on data-sharing between companies . germany 's new coalition deal hammered out between the social democrats and the conservatives does contain references to reach , warning against making it " too expensive and too bureaucratic . " " there is still hope for this law to be on the statute books by the end of the year , " german industry commissioner günther verheugen told meps on tuesday . a sell-out to germa n firms ? but , green meps and environmental groups have slammed the german compromise as a sell-out to big german firms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a production laboratory at basf in germany " if the agreement reached by -lrb- the parliament 's main parties -rrb- is voted through , we risk getting legislation that would be a major setback for the environment and for people 's health , " said leftist mep jonas sjostedt of sweden . the european consumers organization also stressed the need for strong rules to protect the public from tens of thousands of chemicals with which they have contact in everyday life . " some of these chemicals , but we do not know which , almost certainly pose unacceptable risks to ourselves and our children , " it said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

but how 's their sex life ?
riding on the popularity of telenovelas in germany , a web site called " saving love " now offers an online novella , featuring one woman 's struggles to keep the spark of romance alive in her relationship .
pass the cheese ! her name is diana ; she 's 37 , pretty , perky … and frustrated .
while she dispenses advice to the lovelorn and libidinous in the sex columns she pens , she ca n't seem to get her own erotic house in order .
her boyfriend holger might well be climbing the career ladder , but all that time at the office has deflated his interest in the sensual side of things . what 's a healthy , sex-loving girl to do ? well , those who want to know can find out if diana , a fictional creation of a journalist and real-life sex columnist , indeed finds a way out of her erotic desert and resparks the romance or if she has to dump holger and find satisfaction elsewhere can surf on over to www.rettet-die-liebe.de. sponsored by the bayer healthcare , saving love , germany 's first online novella , offers a whole smorgasbord of romance about as cheesy as its name .
it features the ongoing adventures of diana and her attractive , mid-30s to mid-40s friends and siblings , to books of romance , romantic music , greeting cards , horoscopes , even romantic recipes -lrb- whatever those might be -rrb- . it 's hard-core real soap opera though , with , so far , little of the adultery , backstabbing , amnesia and various terminal diseases , which make up so much of traditional soap opera fare .
saving love recounts , like most telenovelas , the struggles of a good-hearted woman who fights to keep or win her man despite all the obstacles in her way . therapy lite ? it 's pretty treacly stuff , kind of like a harlequin romance online with less bodice ripping .
but according to the site , the storyline is not just meant for teenage girls dreaming of their prince or retirees who want to remember their earlier loves and lusts .
rather , it says it hopes to address real-life relationship and sexual problems couples experience by presenting them in a realistic way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " saving love " in one of the sex scenes , diana is tired of the fact that lovemaking has been reduced to one act involving a few body parts .
she needs love , romance , caresses and foreplay .
slam bam , thank ya ma 'am is not her idea of a good time .
she tells her boyfriend that , but he does n't quite get it . has n't she been wanting more sex , he asks ?
well yeah , she counters , but she needs a little tlc in the bedroom along with all the bump and grind . have you been in this situation before , girls ? what 's bayer 's role in all this , one wonders ?
it 's unclear , although bayer is one of the companies behind levitra , an erectile dysfunction drug along the lines of viagra . if you click on the bayer logo at the bottom of the web site , you 're directed to a site for professional sex coaching .
so , if diana and her erotic travails do n't provide the solution to your sexual frustration , the site tells you how to bring in the heavy hitters . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : ex-porn star wild no more former porn star michaela schaffrath has long been trying to make it as a serious actor .

the sentence was much harsher than expected . because hoyzer had been cooperative with authorities and provided extensive testimony in the case , it was widely thought he would get a suspended jail sentence .
but a berlin court ruled that the 26-year-old former referee would serve two years and five months in jail for his role in the worst soccer matching in germany in 30 years .
the sentence went beyond the suspended sentence that prosecutors had asked for . former fellow referee dominik marks , also accused of receiving money from an illegal gambling ring although not thought to have manipulated games , received a suspended jail sentence of one year and six months . croatian ante sapine , hoyzer 's paymaster in the gambling ring , received a prison sentence of two years and eleven months .
his two brothers both received suspended sentences . once a rising talent hoyzer , 26 , was once a promising bundesliga referee who was quickly rising through the ranks .
but after admitting to the manipulation of nine matches , he picked up a lifetime ban from the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- . one of them was a dfb cup game in which one team was losing 2-0 before hoyzer awarded two controversial penalties and sent off a valuable player to help ensure a 4-2 victory for the other side . hoyzer allegedly received twenty thousand euros -lrb- $ 23,000 -rrb- for fixing that game alone .
between april and december 2004 he is thought to have received 68,000 euros -lrb- $ 79,000 -rrb- and a plasma television for fixing games . he was arrested in february after fellow referees went to the authorities with their suspicions .
prosecutors are asking that hoyzer receive a two-year suspended prison sentence , saying their demands are moderate because of hoyer 's testimony in the case . " german football has been spared an unbearable and drawn-out marathon trial , " prosecutor hans-jürgen fätkinhäuer told the court in summing up . croatian connection hoyzer claimed he was tempted into match fixing by the sapina croatian brothers who run a café in berlin where hoyzer spent a good deal of his free time , he said in an interview . “ there are always very expensive cars parked outside the café , " he said .
" i must admit that really impressed me .
this way of life became something i really wanted : having a lot by doing very little .
after that it all snowballed .
it was definitely down to greed . ” the three croatian brothers who are also co-defendents in the case are ante sapine , who was hoyzer 's paymaster , and milan and filip .
they are considered ringleaders of a betting scam that involved fixing a total of 23 matches in 2004 . big impact hoyzer has admitted that the whole scandal has had a negative impact on german soccer . " it will have very serious implications for football , " he said .
but in a final appeal to the court , he asked that he be given a second chance . " i 'm now ready to lead a simple and solid life , " he told the court . a spokesman for the german football association has described the scandal as the biggest crisis in 30 years and said the damage caused by hoyzer was " irreparable . "
thursday 's verdict comes just before the draw for the world cup groupings and opening matches for what is supposed to be the finest hour in german football . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : alleged ringleader recalls hoyzer 's greed disgraced referee robert hoyzer was driven by greed and the lust for power , according to the man who is alleged to be the ringleader behind the german soccer match rigging scandal .

the 1950-53 war , which left the korean peninsula divided , was ended with an armistice and north and south are still technically at war .
both leaders hoped talks on the north korean nuclear crisis and a peace treaty would complement each other .
they insisted that a nuclear-armed north " will not be tolerated " .

mr bush and mr roh met in the ancient korean capital of gyeongju for talks and will later join a host of other regional leaders for the asia-pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit . "
the presidents have talked mainly about north korea .
the tone is very formal - as glutinous as the buffet " reporter 's diary about 250 demonstrators , carrying " stop bush " banners gathered at the city 's train station to protest at the president 's visit .
differences the two leaders said in a statement a peace treaty would " improve confidence and reduce military tension on the korean peninsula " .

mr bush said the us would not consider pyongyang 's demand for a light-water reactor - a stumbling block in the talks - until north korea disarms .
" we 'll consider the light-water reactor at the appropriate time , " mr bush said .
" the appropriate time is after they have verifiably given up their nuclear weapons and / or programmes . "

the bird conservation charity said more than 75,000 people watched the parents rear two chicks at a protected site near porthmadog , gwynedd .
a webcam trained on their man-made nest was so popular the birds will find two cameras and a microphone there when , it is hoped , they return next year .
rspb officer , emyr evans , said : " we want to keep up with the soap story . "
he said the key to the fish-eating birds ' popularity was the live feed from the webcam , revealing life inside the nest , relayed onto a large plasma screen at the visitor centre .
next year , the charity plans to give a fresh angle on the feathered family 's life with a second camera looking just over the rim of the nest .
also , a microphone would for the first time let people hear what was going on .
the birds caught fish in the nearby river to feed their growing chicks " a lot of local people came in every day to keep up with the soap opera .
that 's how we pulled in 75,000 people - it was something like a soap story , " said mr evans .
" people who happened to be in the area heard about it .
people got engaged in it .
" first there was one chick , then two chicks .
then one fledged the nest and then the other - they got quite involved with them .
" it was great watching the live net cam images , but it was a bit like watching a natural history programme with the sound down .
the microphone will just give that extra dimension . "
' sexy species ' mr evans added : " they are quite vocal birds , they do distress calls , hunger calls , contact calls .
a lot of this we could actually hear .
" next year we should be able to hear them as well as watch them . "
the plan to increase camera footage from the nest is to be explained at a meeting of around three dozen organisations which help fund the rspb project at beddgelert in gwynedd , on thursday .
mr evans said the parent birds , currently wintering in west africa , are expected back in march 2006 , and it was hoped they would return to the nest for the third year running .
the viewing hide and visitor centre is to open again at that time .
he added : " ospreys sell themselves .
they draw attention to themselves .
they are a sexy species . "

the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- plans to buy manor farm , a 731-acre site near the ancient stones , to coax back rare birds and insects .
the aim is to narrow the gap between salisbury plain and porton down , to create the largest network of chalk grassland sites in north west europe .
the charity is launching a £ 2.3m appeal to raise money for the site .
missing link the rspb says about 80 % of the country 's wildlife-rich chalk grassland has disappeared .
the manor farm project will increase nesting opportunities for rare birds and benefit scarce butterflies and other insects found only on these sites .
the charity 's conservation director dr mark avery said : " this is the missing piece of the jigsaw for us and will be the rspb 's first major chalk grassland nature reserve .
we all marvel at stonehenge but forget the wonderful countryside around it dr mark avery , rspb " we all marvel at stonehenge but forget the wonderful countryside around it .
if our appeal is successful we will restore the area to its former glory and show other landowners its potential . "
the appeal has been kicked off with £ 933,000 grant from the heritage lottery fund .
the rspb said rare birds including skylark , lapwing and the secretive stone-curlew should benefit from the purchase .
stone curlew numbers plummeted after world war ii because of modern farming methods , but this year the species reached a national recovery target five years early .
butterflies likely to thrive include the adonis blue and duke of burgundy , which depend on plants such as horseshoe vetch and sheep 's fescue , found only on chalk downland .

he added : " there was a very severe incident in barry as well when there was two separate gangs fighting , and that spilled onto the train - this is almost civil unrest . "
mr curtis also called for a " dramatic increase " in policing on the railways and more monitored cctv coverage of stations . "
there was firework throwing on the train a few weeks ' ago - i 'm often a bit worried on here " passenger brigitte pimm employing security guards on trains to help keep order was not the same as having regular police who could make an arrest , he said .
and some passengers who use the valleys rail line have claimed employing security guards has just increased problems .
passenger gareth beady told bbc radio wales : " since they put the security guards on the trains a lot of the kids are seeing that more of an opportunity to get a rise out of them .
" there was always rowdy kids before that , but it has increased at an exponential rate since the security guards came on board . "
another passenger who regularly uses the treorchy line said she did not feel safe on the train .
brigitte pimm said : " there 's quite a lot of yobbish behaviour and you often get teenagers getting on here with cans of lager and they often cause trouble .
" and there was firework throwing on the train a few weeks ' ago - i 'm often a bit worried on here . "
bricks and stones police said many of the offences on trains were related to drinking .
some stations have removed benches on platforms to try and stop people gathering there .
pc derek anderson , who works in plain clothes on the railways in the south wales valleys , said they were trying to crack down on incidents in the rhondda .
" there 's a lot of what we call train surfing , when they grab on the backs of trains as they go out , " he said .
" they also open doors from the outside - which puts a train 's brakes on - -lrb- throw -rrb- bricks and stones through windows of trains .
" people get off the train and they 're harassed by 20 to 30 youths . "
councillor cennard davies told bbc wales the police , community and train companies needed to work together to reduce the problems .
he said cleaning stations up would be the best start .
" if it looks presentable , people tend to behave a little better , " he said .

he has been accused of accepting illegal payments while mayor of ribeirao preto , in sao paulo state .
but mr palocci - an ally of the brazilian president - said allegations were politically motivated and false .
financial markets in brazil were shaken earlier this week by rumours that he would resign .
investors , who see mr palocci as market-friendly , feared he might be replaced .
but speaking before the senate committee , mr palocci made clear that he wanted to remain in his post .
he also said that he had no intention of changing his strict economic policies , despite attacks from within the government .
falling popularity brazil 's currency , the real , and share markets responded positively to the minister 's appearance , but he may face further questioning in congress .
in recent months , the government has been dogged by corruption allegations .
the ruling workers ' party has been linked to illegal funding and bribery in congress .
president luiz inacio lula da silva has not been implicated in the scandal , but he has seen his own popularity ratings fall and his chances of re-election next year damaged .

the green machine was showcased for the first time by mit 's nicholas negroponte at the un net summit in tunis .
he plans to have millions of $ 100 machines in production within a year .
the laptops are powered with a wind-up crank , have very low power consumption and will let children interact with each other while learning .
" children will be able to learn by doing , not just through instruction - they will be able to open up new fronts for their education , particularly peer-to-peer learning , " said mr annan .
he added that the initiative was " inspiring " , and held the promise of special and economic development for children in developing countries .
green machine the foldable lime green laptop made its debut at the world summit on the information society , which is looking at ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world nicholas negroponte , mit net control row rumbles on un predicts ' net of things ' nicknamed the green machine , it can be used as a conventional computer , or an electronic book .
a child can control it using a cursor at the back of the machine or a touchpad on the front .
it can also be held and used like a handheld games console and can function as a tv .
" the idea is that it fulfils many roles .
it is the whole theory that learning is seamless , " said professor negroponte , who set up the non-profit one laptop per child group to sell the laptops to developing nation governments .
" studies have shown that kids take up computers much more easily in the comfort of warm , well-lit rich country living rooms , but also in the slums and remote areas all around the developing world . "
there has already been firm interest in the machines from governments , though no laptops have yet been manufactured .
professor negroponte said he had asked the most enthusiastic countries , thailand and brazil , not to give written commitments to buy the machines until they had seen the working model , likely to be produced in february .
there has also been interest in the machines from five manufacturers and three big brand name technology firms , but no firm commitments had been made .
big name supporters the laptops will be encased in rubber to make them durable and their ac adaptors will act as carrying straps .
they have a 500mhz processor , with flash memory instead of a hard drive which has more delicate moving parts , and four usb ports .
they link up and share a net connection through " mesh networking " .
a working prototype of the machine was on show plans for the global domination of the children 's laptop are ambitious .
" the initial plan is to start with countries that are big and very different to each other , " said professor negroponte .
" we are launching with six countries initially , then six months later , as many countries as possible . "
those include countries in the arab world , two asian , one sub-saharan , and south american nations .
the project also has some big name supporters on board , including google , and media mogul rupert murdoch .
but it will rely on open-source software so that support for local content and languages can easily be built .
although the laptops will initially be available to government only , the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- is in talks with commercial manufacturers to make it available on the open market .
to take part in the initiative , governments have to commit to buying a million machines for around $ 100 each .
mr annan urged leaders and stakeholders at the summit to do their utmost in ensuring that the initiative was fully incorporated into efforts to build an inclusive information society .
" we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world , " professor negroponte said , as costs continued to drop .
he added that it was critical that children actually owned , instead of loaned , the machines .
to overcome the potential problem of secondary " grey markets " for the machines , professor negroponte said the idea was that they would be so ubiquitous and prominent it would deter potential re-selling .
" i hope there would be community pressure so it does not appear in the secondary market .
the technology is in it so that the machine is disabled if not connected to the network after a few days , " he added .
sharing and collaborating technical breakthroughs have already driven the prototype design , but every technical breakthrough in the next five years would mean costs would continue to fall , he said .
have your say they could n't have chosen a different colour for those $ 100 laptops ?
that awful lime green will hurt the eyes after a while serenity send your comments michail bietsas , mit 's director of computer systems told the bbc news website that laptops benefited primarily from mesh networking , as a way of sharing scarce net connections .
one computer with a wi-fi or 3g net modem , for example , would share the connection with others in a classroom .
he explained that the display did not have a backlight or colour filters that more pricey lcd laptop displays used , so saved power .
instead , bright leds are used which reduced power consumption by a factor of 10 .
the screens are dual-mode displays so that the laptop can still be used in varying light conditions .
although children will be able to interact with each other through the machines , education was still the priority for the laptops .
but by using mesh networking , the vision is for children to interact while doing homework , and even share homework tips on a local community scale .
collaboration will also be encouraged by using open-source software , which the children could develop themselves and use in local communities .
" every single problem you can think of , poverty , peace , the environment , is solved with education or including education , " said professor negroponte .
" so when we make this available , it is an education project , not a laptop project .
the digital divide is a learning divide - digital is the means through which children learn leaning .
this is , we believe , the way to do it . "

the green machine was showcased for the first time by mit 's nicholas negroponte at the un net summit in tunis .
he plans to have millions of $ 100 machines in production within a year .
the laptops are powered with a wind-up crank , have very low power consumption and will let children interact with each other while learning .
" children will be able to learn by doing , not just through instruction - they will be able to open up new fronts for their education , particularly peer-to-peer learning , " said mr annan .
he added that the initiative was " inspiring " , and held the promise of special and economic development for children in developing countries .
green machine the foldable lime green laptop made its debut at the world summit on the information society , which is looking at ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world nicholas negroponte , mit net control row rumbles on un predicts ' net of things ' nicknamed the green machine , it can be used as a conventional computer , or an electronic book .
a child can control it using a cursor at the back of the machine or a touchpad on the front .
it can also be held and used like a handheld games console and can function as a tv .
" the idea is that it fulfils many roles .
it is the whole theory that learning is seamless , " said professor negroponte , who set up the non-profit one laptop per child group to sell the laptops to developing nation governments .
" studies have shown that kids take up computers much more easily in the comfort of warm , well-lit rich country living rooms , but also in the slums and remote areas all around the developing world . "
there has already been firm interest in the machines from governments , though no laptops have yet been manufactured .
professor negroponte said he had asked the most enthusiastic countries , thailand and brazil , not to give written commitments to buy the machines until they had seen the working model , likely to be produced in february .
there has also been interest in the machines from five manufacturers and three big brand name technology firms , but no firm commitments had been made .
big name supporters the laptops will be encased in rubber to make them durable and their ac adaptors will act as carrying straps .
they have a 500mhz processor , with flash memory instead of a hard drive which has more delicate moving parts , and four usb ports .
they link up and share a net connection through " mesh networking " .
a working prototype of the machine was on show plans for the global domination of the children 's laptop are ambitious .
" the initial plan is to start with countries that are big and very different to each other , " said professor negroponte .
" we are launching with six countries initially , then six months later , as many countries as possible . "
those include countries in the arab world , two asian , one sub-saharan , and south american nations .
the project also has some big name supporters on board , including google , and media mogul rupert murdoch .
but it will rely on open-source software so that support for local content and languages can easily be built .
although the laptops will initially be available to government only , the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- is in talks with commercial manufacturers to make it available on the open market .
to take part in the initiative , governments have to commit to buying a million machines for around $ 100 each .
mr annan urged leaders and stakeholders at the summit to do their utmost in ensuring that the initiative was fully incorporated into efforts to build an inclusive information society .
" we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world , " professor negroponte said , as costs continued to drop .
he added that it was critical that children actually owned , instead of loaned , the machines .
to overcome the potential problem of secondary " grey markets " for the machines , professor negroponte said the idea was that they would be so ubiquitous and prominent it would deter potential re-selling .
" i hope there would be community pressure so it does not appear in the secondary market .
the technology is in it so that the machine is disabled if not connected to the network after a few days , " he added .
sharing and collaborating technical breakthroughs have already driven the prototype design , but every technical breakthrough in the next five years would mean costs would continue to fall , he said .
have your say they could n't have chosen a different colour for those $ 100 laptops ?
that awful lime green will hurt the eyes after a while serenity send your comments michail bietsas , mit 's director of computer systems told the bbc news website that laptops benefited primarily from mesh networking , as a way of sharing scarce net connections .
one computer with a wi-fi or 3g net modem , for example , would share the connection with others in a classroom .
he explained that the display did not have a backlight or colour filters that more pricey lcd laptop displays used , so saved power .
instead , bright leds are used which reduced power consumption by a factor of 10 .
the screens are dual-mode displays so that the laptop can still be used in varying light conditions .
although children will be able to interact with each other through the machines , education was still the priority for the laptops .
but by using mesh networking , the vision is for children to interact while doing homework , and even share homework tips on a local community scale .
collaboration will also be encouraged by using open-source software , which the children could develop themselves and use in local communities .

green machine the foldable lime green laptop made its debut at the world summit on the information society , which is looking at ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world nicholas negroponte , mit net control row rumbles on un predicts ' net of things ' nicknamed the green machine , it can be used as a conventional computer , or an electronic book .
a child can control it using a cursor at the back of the machine or a touchpad on the front .
it can also be held and used like a handheld games console and can function as a tv .
" the idea is that it fulfils many roles .
it is the whole theory that learning is seamless , " said professor negroponte , who set up the non-profit one laptop per child group to sell the laptops to developing nation governments .
" studies have shown that kids take up computers much more easily in the comfort of warm , well-lit rich country living rooms , but also in the slums and remote areas all around the developing world . "
there has already been firm interest in the machines from governments , though no laptops have yet been manufactured .
professor negroponte said he had asked the most enthusiastic countries , thailand and brazil , not to give written commitments to buy the machines until they had seen the working model , likely to be produced in february .
there has also been interest in the machines from five manufacturers and three big brand name technology firms , but no firm commitments had been made .
big name supporters the laptops will be encased in rubber to make them durable and their ac adaptors will act as carrying straps .
they have a 500mhz processor , with flash memory instead of a hard drive which has more delicate moving parts , and four usb ports .
they link up and share a net connection through " mesh networking " .
a working prototype of the machine was on show plans for the global domination of the children 's laptop are ambitious .
" the initial plan is to start with countries that are big and very different to each other , " said professor negroponte .
" we are launching with six countries initially , then six months later , as many countries as possible . "
those include countries in the arab world , two asian , one sub-saharan , and south american nations .
the project also has some big name supporters on board , including google , and media mogul rupert murdoch .
but it will rely on open-source software so that support for local content and languages can easily be built .
although the laptops will initially be available to government only , the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- is in talks with commercial manufacturers to make it available on the open market .
to take part in the initiative , governments have to commit to buying a million machines for around $ 100 each .
mr annan urged leaders and stakeholders at the summit to do their utmost in ensuring that the initiative was fully incorporated into efforts to build an inclusive information society .
" we really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world , " professor negroponte said , as costs continued to drop .
he added that it was critical that children actually owned , instead of loaned , the machines .
to overcome the potential problem of secondary " grey markets " for the machines , professor negroponte said the idea was that they would be so ubiquitous and prominent it would deter potential re-selling .
" i hope there would be community pressure so it does not appear in the secondary market .
the technology is in it so that the machine is disabled if not connected to the network after a few days , " he added .
sharing and collaborating technical breakthroughs have already driven the prototype design , but every technical breakthrough in the next five years would mean costs would continue to fall , he said .
have your say they could n't have chosen a different colour for those $ 100 laptops ?
that awful lime green will hurt the eyes after a while serenity send your comments michail bietsas , mit 's director of computer systems told the bbc news website that laptops benefited primarily from mesh networking , as a way of sharing scarce net connections .
one computer with a wi-fi or 3g net modem , for example , would share the connection with others in a classroom .
he explained that the display did not have a backlight or colour filters that more pricey lcd laptop displays used , so saved power .
instead , bright leds are used which reduced power consumption by a factor of 10 .
the screens are dual-mode displays so that the laptop can still be used in varying light conditions .
although children will be able to interact with each other through the machines , education was still the priority for the laptops .
but by using mesh networking , the vision is for children to interact while doing homework , and even share homework tips on a local community scale .
collaboration will also be encouraged by using open-source software , which the children could develop themselves and use in local communities .
" every single problem you can think of , poverty , peace , the environment , is solved with education or including education , " said professor negroponte .
" so when we make this available , it is an education project , not a laptop project .
the digital divide is a learning divide - digital is the means through which children learn leaning .
this is , we believe , the way to do it . "

an executive spokesman said it had committed £ 1.5m for the integration of refugees and asylum seekers .

the committee 's report also criticised the short-term nature of the fresh talent initiative .

but the executive said the two-year scheme gave international students the opportunity to convince employers of their potential before employers had to consider going through the work permit process .

it is morning at the north preventive jail , one of mexico city 's 11 jails .
in the admissions office , guards are busy signing in many new inmates and checking on their belongings , which they call " remittances " .
jails in mexico are overcrowded the north preventive jail is overcrowded , as are the rest of mexican prisons .
it holds 9,300 people - but it was designed to hold half that number .
but overpopulation is not the main problem here - it is crime .
this is a medium-to-high security prison .
inmates here have been charged with murder , sexual abuse , kidnapping , robbery and drug-trafficking .
many have yet to be sentenced .
there are only four guards to watch over 300 prisoners , all of whom are considered very dangerous .
" it is a tense situation , inmates are usually aggressive , " says martin cordoba gomez , supervisor of the jail 's maximum security area .
mr cordoba , who has been working at the prison for more than a decade , adds that : " guards need to learn how to approach them . "
' active criminals ' guns , drugs , money and mobile phones are frequently smuggled into mexican jails .
the authorities acknowledge that crimes such as kidnapping , drug-smuggling , as well as attacks on rival gangs in mexico city and other parts of the country , are sometimes planned from within prisons walls .
members of big or small gangs manage to remain active despite being behind bars .
they usually operate via their visitors or lawyers armando aguirre security chief at the north preventive jail they believe , for example , that the abduction in july of the cruz azul football team 's manager , the argentine ruben omar romano , was masterminded in a jail .
" members of big or small gangs manage to remain active despite being behind bars .
they usually operate via their visitors or lawyers , " says armando aguirre , security chief at the north preventive jail .
the authorities admit that " vulnerability " and " permeability " are significant problems in mexico 's penitentiary system .
" it is pretty evident that some inmates keep on committing offences despite being in prison , possibly with the help of relatives or friends who visit them , " says the jail 's director , armando mendez gutierrez .
prisoners also communicate with the outside world using mobile phones that have been smuggled in and the 70 public telephones available at the detention centre , according to the authorities .
mexico 's police force is currently testing technology to block mobile signals in the jail and track down calls made from public phones .
' accomplices outside ' but some claim that corruption and complicity of penitentiary officials are also to blame .
" all sorts of crimes are committed in this prison : robbery , murder , prostitution , and drug and alcohol trafficking , " an inmate who asks not to be named says .
inmates communicate with the outside world using mobile phones " those who have money can do whatever they want .
many inmates have accomplices outside who follow their orders " , he added .
relatives are allowed to visit four times a week , but some see their loved ones less frequently .
this is because they can not afford expenses like travel , food and other articles they may want to bring to the inmates .
some claim they have to have extra money for bribes in order to smuggle in prohibited items .
" anything can be smuggled in , " says sonia , whose nephew is serving a prison term .
" there 's corruption everywhere .
things do n't work for us if we take the right path . "

the study looks at how the use of electronic tags and sensors could create an " internet of things " .
the report by the international telecommunications union was released at the un net summit in tunis .
thousands of delegates are discussing ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
" it would seem that science fiction is slowly turning into science fact in an ' internet of things ' based on ubiquitous network connectivity , " said the report .
" today , in the 2000s , we are heading into a new era of ubiquity , where the ' users ' of the internet will be counted in billions and where humans may become the minority as generators and receivers of traffic . "
global involvement radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- , sensors , robotics and nanotechnology will make processing power increasingly available in smaller and smaller packages so that networked computing dissolves into the fabric of things around us .
the result could mean remote controls embedded in clothing , cars that alert their driver when they have developed a fault , managers who check on workers through the rfid devices embedded in their phones , and bags that remind their owners that they have forgotten something .
there are already examples of the technology in action .
tiny sensors are used to check san francisco 's golden gate bridge for structural damage and in coffee beans in brazil for quality control .
some of the benefits of this ubiquitous networked society include cheaper hiv treatments , more effective pharmaceutical controls and the purification of water using nanofilters .
wealth creation unlike previous technological revolutions , some developing countries are already heavily involved in generating the science and products around these items .
" the traditional dominance of industrialised countries in scientific and technological innovations will weaken , in favour of less wealthy but no less tech-savvy nations , " said the itu report . "
things like privacy protection should become part of the design itself of the technology , even before it makes it to market " lara srivastava , itu entitled the internet of things , the study said that the demands of multi-national businesses are forcing countries to adopt the new technology .
for example , the request by american retail giant wal-mart that its top suppliers use rfid tags has prompted chinese manufacturers to adopt the technology .
the so-called internet of things is predicted to offer new business opportunities for all , from manufacturers to the telecoms industry , and create entirely new markets .
but it cold also have negative impacts , such as increased levels of electro-magnetic radiation generated by a world of communicating objects .
everything monitored ?
the itu report cautions that the needs and wishes of human being must be kept central to all these endeavours and the public must be educated about their implications .
" money talks , that 's clear , " said lara srivastava , of the strategy and policy unit at the itu .
" however we can make it talk less loudly if we put forward some of these issues early on .
" things like privacy protection should become part of the design itself of the technology , even before it makes it to market . "
to this end , governments , the private sector and other agencies must act from the outset to safeguard principles of informed consent , data confidentiality and security , according to the report .
" society will have to deal with some very substantial issues , " said jonathan murray , chief technology officer for microsoft europe .
" the rapid transition created by the network effect do not increase the digital divide . "
concerns about rfid technology have already led to consumer boycotts .
in addition , the lack of technical standards for the component technologies could hinder its evolution .
but while it is hard to say to what extent it will develop , the past gives us a hint of the future , according to ms srivastava .
" it 's safe to say that technology today is more pervasive than we would ever have imagined possible 10 years ago , " she said .
" similarly , 10 years from now things will continue in this general direction .

the study looks at how the use of electronic tags and sensors could create an " internet of things " .
the report by the international telecommunications union was released at the un net summit in tunis .
thousands of delegates are discussing ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
" it would seem that science fiction is slowly turning into science fact in an ' internet of things ' based on ubiquitous network connectivity , " said the report .
" today , in the 2000s , we are heading into a new era of ubiquity , where the ' users ' of the internet will be counted in billions and where humans may become the minority as generators and receivers of traffic . "
global involvement radio frequency identification -lrb- rfid -rrb- , sensors , robotics and nanotechnology will make processing power increasingly available in smaller and smaller packages so that networked computing dissolves into the fabric of things around us .
sensors check san francisco 's famous landmark for damage the result could mean remote controls embedded in clothing , cars that alert their driver when they have developed a fault , managers who check on workers through the rfid devices embedded in their phones , and bags that remind their owners that they have forgotten something .
there are already examples of the technology in action .
tiny sensors are used to check san francisco 's golden gate bridge for structural damage and in coffee beans in brazil for quality control .
some of the benefits of this ubiquitous networked society include cheaper hiv treatments , more effective pharmaceutical controls and the purification of water using nanofilters .
wealth creation unlike previous technological revolutions , some developing countries are already heavily involved in generating the science and products around these items .
" the traditional dominance of industrialised countries in scientific and technological innovations will weaken , in favour of less wealthy but no less tech-savvy nations , " said the itu report .
things like privacy protection should become part of the design itself of the technology , even before it makes it to market lara srivastava , itu entitled the internet of things , the study said that the demands of multi-national businesses are forcing countries to adopt the new technology .
for example , the request by american retail giant wal-mart that its top suppliers use rfid tags has prompted chinese manufacturers to adopt the technology .
the so-called internet of things is predicted to offer new business opportunities for all , from manufacturers to the telecoms industry , and create entirely new markets .
but it cold also have negative impacts , such as increased levels of electro-magnetic radiation generated by a world of communicating objects .
everything monitored ?
the itu report cautions that the needs and wishes of human being must be kept central to all these endeavours and the public must be educated about their implications .
" money talks , that 's clear , " said lara srivastava , of the strategy and policy unit at the itu .
" however we can make it talk less loudly if we put forward some of these issues early on .
" things like privacy protection should become part of the design itself of the technology , even before it makes it to market . "
to this end , governments , the private sector and other agencies must act from the outset to safeguard principles of informed consent , data confidentiality and security , according to the report .
" society will have to deal with some very substantial issues , " said jonathan murray , chief technology officer for microsoft europe .
" the rapid transition created by the network effect do not increase the digital divide . "
concerns about rfid technology have already led to consumer boycotts .
in addition , the lack of technical standards for the component technologies could hinder its evolution .
but while it is hard to say to what extent it will develop , the past gives us a hint of the future , according to ms srivastava .
" it 's safe to say that technology today is more pervasive than we would ever have imagined possible 10 years ago , " she said .
" similarly , 10 years from now things will continue in this general direction .
that 's what these new technologies are telling us . "
