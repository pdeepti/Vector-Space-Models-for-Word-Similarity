also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said during the proceedings that fifa had known of the kit over nine months before the cup started in tunisia .
not until the tournament commenced did trouble brew and fifa announced the ban . cameroon continued to wear the uniform , was subsequently fined 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 150,000 -rrb- and more importantly , had six points deducted in their world cup 2006 qualifying campaign .
puma paid the fine and fifa later rescinded that second decision at the behest of the african football federation but stuck to its ban on the cat suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairman jochen zeitz and his company puma had the courage to tangle with fifa puma then took fifa to court .
in her ruling , judge ingrid kefer said that yes , fifa had stated in its rules that a player 's uniform must consist of shorts and jerseys . " it is not written anywhere that the two can not be connected , " kefer added . puma has charged their bigger competitors adidas of nudging fifa to punish cameroon for the modern uniform .
adidas has denied the allegations . kefer did not allow puma to introduce any such evidence of influence by adidas .
however , she did not understand why fifa objects to the uniforms which she stated served a " good purpose . "
the shorts can not be pulled down by an opponent and the " unappetizing exchange of jerseys " would no longer be possible . fifa legal director heinz tännler now has four weeks to react to the court 's arguments .
" it 's not over until it 's over .
nothing has been decided yet , " he told reporters . the final decision is not far off .
kefer will read her verdict on june 1 . fifa announces fan fests meanwhile , fans from around the globe have submitted over ten million applications for the lottery of tickets to next year 's world cup in germany .
unfortunately , there are only 812,000 available which means that millions of people will come away empty-handed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you may need the luck of a leprechaun if you hope to get a world cup ticket for those fans so unlucky as to lose out , there is the possibility to buy tickets from their own country 's soccer associations .
should this fail , fifa has the solution - fan fests .
in all twelve host cities , broadcasts of tournament games will be shown on big video walls for public viewing . organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- president franz beckenbauer had nothing but praise for the concept on the world cup web site .
" fifa , our oc and the host cities have worked together fantastically yet again .
in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans who could not get their hands on a ticket .
now we will be in a position to do that , with every host city effectively having two fifa world cup venues : the stadium and the official fan fest . " german consumer advocate groups , who have been critical of certain aspects of the ticket sales process , for example the submission of personal data for ticket orders , were pleased by the announcement .
carel mohn , press spokesman for the federation of german consumer organizations , called the decision " thoroughly positive . " " we were concerned about a restriction of video coverage , " mohn said .
also worrisome had been the possibility that only world cup sponsors , such as coca-cola , would be given exclusive sales licenses at the fan fest .
but this fear has also been laid to rest according to mohn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer was not only a great soccer player , he is also a sharp businessman the company that owns the rights to the coverage in germany , the switzerland-based infront sports & media ag , said it was important to come to an early agreement with the host cities .
former german soccer star , current commentator for national team coverage on german public television , and executive director of infront , günter netzer , said that it " is a gesture to the cities , who are making a vital contribution to the success of the fifa world cup , and above all to the fans and the visitors .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.04.2005 focus turns to papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cardinals have a tough task on their hands for all its stately solemnity , the funeral friday of john paul ii means attention now moves to choosing a successor .
cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope .

four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .
-lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany .

so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .

also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.04.2005 european banks leave germany in the dust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks ' headquarters are sky high , but profits are n't german banks are limping behind their counterparts in other european countries .
german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .
that way , he said , employees would not be forced to pay for slumps brought about by banks ' own risky choices . ulrike schuler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .

from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .

four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope .

four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .
that way , he said , employees would not be forced to pay for slumps brought about by banks ' own risky choices . ulrike schuler -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 09.04.2005 cat suit comeback ; fans receive present großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indomitable lions just may run in their cat suits again cameroon 's indomitable lions may be back in their one-piece uniforms in the near future .
also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said during the proceedings that fifa had known of the kit over nine months before the cup started in tunisia .
not until the tournament commenced did trouble brew and fifa announced the ban . cameroon continued to wear the uniform , was subsequently fined 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 150,000 -rrb- and more importantly , had six points deducted in their world cup 2006 qualifying campaign .
puma paid the fine and fifa later rescinded that second decision at the behest of the african football federation but stuck to its ban on the cat suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairman jochen zeitz and his company puma had the courage to tangle with fifa puma then took fifa to court .
in her ruling , judge ingrid kefer said that yes , fifa had stated in its rules that a player 's uniform must consist of shorts and jerseys . " it is not written anywhere that the two can not be connected , " kefer added . puma has charged their bigger competitors adidas of nudging fifa to punish cameroon for the modern uniform .
adidas has denied the allegations . kefer did not allow puma to introduce any such evidence of influence by adidas .
however , she did not understand why fifa objects to the uniforms which she stated served a " good purpose . "
the shorts can not be pulled down by an opponent and the " unappetizing exchange of jerseys " would no longer be possible . fifa legal director heinz tännler now has four weeks to react to the court 's arguments .
" it 's not over until it 's over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

less than two hours before the nuptials , several thousand people , some waving union jack flags and hats , lined the picturesque streets under blue skies to catch a glimpse of the new royal couple . in comparison , around 600,000 turned out in london in july 1981 when charles wedded diana inside the domed splendour of st paul 's cathedral . " the sun is shining .
the crowds are filling the streets .
it 's going to be a wonderful day , " said paddy harverson , the prince of wales 's communications director , on bbc radio , as the bride and groom made their way to windsor . quick , closed ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william .
charles and parker bowles , both divorcees , were declared man and wife by local registrar clair williams in a private 20-minute ceremony in the guildhall before 28 specially invited guests and no media at all . the couple 's eldest sons by their previous marriages , prince william and tom parker bowles , acted as witnesses .
notable by their absence , however , were the groom 's parents : queen elizabeth ii and prince philip .
after the wedding a televised 45-minute anglican service of blessing in windsor castle , where the newlyweds - reading from the stern and uncompromising 1662 book of common prayer - are to " acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness " .
the mood is set to lighten up at an afternoon reception , also in windsor castle , at which more than 700 people had been invited , ranging from european royals to the likes of pop star sting . the couple are then due to slip away to scotland for a honeymoon on the royal estate of balmoral . " occasions like this bring the whole world together , " said wellwisher sheila parry , 67 , a retired farmer from south wales , who camped out next to the guildhall overnight to guarantee herself a good view of the wedding procession . " it is much quieter , but that is to be expected for a second marriage , " she added . wedding dogged by hitches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince of wales and his partner camilla parker bowles attend the mey games in caithness , scotland in this aug .

but many still hold the practical , country-loving parker bowles responsible for the break-up of charles ' marriage to the glamorous diana , who died in a paris car crash in 1997 , a year after her divorce from charles . saturday 's wedding , originally planned for the day before , was hastily rescheduled in order not to clash with the vatican funeral of pope john paul ii , attended by charles and prime minister tony blair , one of the guests at saturday 's blessing.the arrangements were dogged by glitches from the beginning , with the wedding venue being changed from windsor castle to the guildhall for licensing reasons and queen elizabeth opting not to be present when they tied the knot . a handful of royalty purists lodged objections right up to the wedding day , while a tabloid newspaper exposed security flaws by driving into windsor castle in a rented van with a fake bomb inside . even on saturday , charles woke up to see himself on the front pages of newspapers shaking hands at the pope 's funeral with zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is accused by the british government of gross human rights violations . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mention the wedding royalty-obsessed germans are getting a kick out of the troubled wedding preparations for britain 's prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .

there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope .

even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .
-lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.04.2005 focus turns to papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cardinals have a tough task on their hands for all its stately solemnity , the funeral friday of john paul ii means attention now moves to choosing a successor .
cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .
-lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .

also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.04.2005 focus turns to papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cardinals have a tough task on their hands for all its stately solemnity , the funeral friday of john paul ii means attention now moves to choosing a successor .
cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .
" a lot of competition lowers the profit margins , " schäfer said .
" for customers , that means credit terms are better . " high personnel costs besides the intense competition in germany , the sluggish german economy and high personnel costs are also reasons for lower profits , according to schäfer , who said cutting down on personnel could be a way to bring banks in dire economic straits back into the black .
however , she warns against layoffs when a bank is making a profit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank logo at frankfurt headquarters " if areas like customer service are cut back , that could negatively impact profits , " she said . she does n't see germany 's poor performance in european banking comparisons as a reason for undue alarm , pointing out that the serious slump two years ago in the sector is now over and most banks succeeded in getting over the worst .
developments over the past two years are anything but unhealthy , she said . too little open competition ? but stock analyst dieter hein of " fairesearch " does n't see the situation in such rosy terms .
according to him , the reasons for german banks ' poor yields can be traced back to a lack of open competition in the sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government subsidies for banking institutes such as the sparkassen savings banks and the landesbanken are hindrances to a level playing field .
he and other experts have said that only a consolidation in the sector could lead to higher profits - for fewer banks . as opposed to the diw 's schäfer , hein said the health of german banks has " dramatically worsened , " pointing to the fact that today , as opposed to 15 years ago , there are no german banks among the world 's top 20 .
he accepts the fact that job losses might occur before banks can start growing again . " first of all , we need to see a shrinking of the sector , " he said .
" only when that happens can banks start hiring again . " calls for a " speculation tax " but that kind of thinking is foreign to globalization critics like the organization attac .
the group 's finance expert , peter wahl , considers it illusory of banks to think they can chase after rates of return which are higher than economic growth .
he calls it a " parasitic phenomenon . "
besides , he added , banks in germany are doing just fine . " if some banks are doing badly , it 's due to their very risky speculative businesses , " he said , adding that his organization is in favor of introducing a " speculation tax " to prevent such behaviour in the future .

german financial institutions survived the crisis of two years ago , but their profits are still low .
there are several reasons for that . according to german financial daily handelsblatt , last year 22 out of 25 large european banks reported after-tax rates of return of 15 percent .
most german banks , on the other hand , can only expect to attain around 8 or 9 percent this year .
only deutsche bank is realistically hoping for a yield of 15 percent . although the germans are far behind their competitors , whether that is in itself cause for great concern depends on your perspective , according to dorothea schäfer , a banking expert at the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- .
on the one hand , analyses have confirmed that german banks are not very profitable in international comparisons , she said .
according to a study by deutsche bank research , the return on equity among german banks from 1992 to 2001 averaged just below six percent .
in the uk , the average was 16 percent . but according to schäfer , the main reason for the poor yields is the competitive banking landscape in germany , which while bad for banks ' profits , has definite advantages for customers .

less than two hours before the nuptials , several thousand people , some waving union jack flags and hats , lined the picturesque streets under blue skies to catch a glimpse of the new royal couple . in comparison , around 600,000 turned out in london in july 1981 when charles wedded diana inside the domed splendour of st paul 's cathedral . " the sun is shining .
the crowds are filling the streets .
it 's going to be a wonderful day , " said paddy harverson , the prince of wales 's communications director , on bbc radio , as the bride and groom made their way to windsor . quick , closed ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william .
charles and parker bowles , both divorcees , were declared man and wife by local registrar clair williams in a private 20-minute ceremony in the guildhall before 28 specially invited guests and no media at all . the couple 's eldest sons by their previous marriages , prince william and tom parker bowles , acted as witnesses .
notable by their absence , however , were the groom 's parents : queen elizabeth ii and prince philip .
after the wedding a televised 45-minute anglican service of blessing in windsor castle , where the newlyweds - reading from the stern and uncompromising 1662 book of common prayer - are to " acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness " .
the mood is set to lighten up at an afternoon reception , also in windsor castle , at which more than 700 people had been invited , ranging from european royals to the likes of pop star sting . the couple are then due to slip away to scotland for a honeymoon on the royal estate of balmoral . " occasions like this bring the whole world together , " said wellwisher sheila parry , 67 , a retired farmer from south wales , who camped out next to the guildhall overnight to guarantee herself a good view of the wedding procession . " it is much quieter , but that is to be expected for a second marriage , " she added . wedding dogged by hitches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince of wales and his partner camilla parker bowles attend the mey games in caithness , scotland in this aug .

charles and parker bowles , who will take the title of duchess of cornwall , have had an intimate relationship going back more than 30 years , and in recent years have effectively lived as man and wife , often appearing together at official functions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's late princess diana , princess of wales .
but many still hold the practical , country-loving parker bowles responsible for the break-up of charles ' marriage to the glamorous diana , who died in a paris car crash in 1997 , a year after her divorce from charles . saturday 's wedding , originally planned for the day before , was hastily rescheduled in order not to clash with the vatican funeral of pope john paul ii , attended by charles and prime minister tony blair , one of the guests at saturday 's blessing.the arrangements were dogged by glitches from the beginning , with the wedding venue being changed from windsor castle to the guildhall for licensing reasons and queen elizabeth opting not to be present when they tied the knot . a handful of royalty purists lodged objections right up to the wedding day , while a tabloid newspaper exposed security flaws by driving into windsor castle in a rented van with a fake bomb inside . even on saturday , charles woke up to see himself on the front pages of newspapers shaking hands at the pope 's funeral with zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is accused by the british government of gross human rights violations . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mention the wedding royalty-obsessed germans are getting a kick out of the troubled wedding preparations for britain 's prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said during the proceedings that fifa had known of the kit over nine months before the cup started in tunisia .
not until the tournament commenced did trouble brew and fifa announced the ban . cameroon continued to wear the uniform , was subsequently fined 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 150,000 -rrb- and more importantly , had six points deducted in their world cup 2006 qualifying campaign .
puma paid the fine and fifa later rescinded that second decision at the behest of the african football federation but stuck to its ban on the cat suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairman jochen zeitz and his company puma had the courage to tangle with fifa puma then took fifa to court .
in her ruling , judge ingrid kefer said that yes , fifa had stated in its rules that a player 's uniform must consist of shorts and jerseys . " it is not written anywhere that the two can not be connected , " kefer added . puma has charged their bigger competitors adidas of nudging fifa to punish cameroon for the modern uniform .
adidas has denied the allegations . kefer did not allow puma to introduce any such evidence of influence by adidas .
however , she did not understand why fifa objects to the uniforms which she stated served a " good purpose . "
the shorts can not be pulled down by an opponent and the " unappetizing exchange of jerseys " would no longer be possible . fifa legal director heinz tännler now has four weeks to react to the court 's arguments .
" it 's not over until it 's over .
nothing has been decided yet , " he told reporters . the final decision is not far off .
kefer will read her verdict on june 1 . fifa announces fan fests meanwhile , fans from around the globe have submitted over ten million applications for the lottery of tickets to next year 's world cup in germany .
unfortunately , there are only 812,000 available which means that millions of people will come away empty-handed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you may need the luck of a leprechaun if you hope to get a world cup ticket for those fans so unlucky as to lose out , there is the possibility to buy tickets from their own country 's soccer associations .
should this fail , fifa has the solution - fan fests .
in all twelve host cities , broadcasts of tournament games will be shown on big video walls for public viewing . organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- president franz beckenbauer had nothing but praise for the concept on the world cup web site .
" fifa , our oc and the host cities have worked together fantastically yet again .
in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans who could not get their hands on a ticket .
now we will be in a position to do that , with every host city effectively having two fifa world cup venues : the stadium and the official fan fest . " german consumer advocate groups , who have been critical of certain aspects of the ticket sales process , for example the submission of personal data for ticket orders , were pleased by the announcement .
carel mohn , press spokesman for the federation of german consumer organizations , called the decision " thoroughly positive . " " we were concerned about a restriction of video coverage , " mohn said .
also worrisome had been the possibility that only world cup sponsors , such as coca-cola , would be given exclusive sales licenses at the fan fest .
but this fear has also been laid to rest according to mohn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter netzer was not only a great soccer player , he is also a sharp businessman the company that owns the rights to the coverage in germany , the switzerland-based infront sports & media ag , said it was important to come to an early agreement with the host cities .
former german soccer star , current commentator for national team coverage on german public television , and executive director of infront , günter netzer , said that it " is a gesture to the cities , who are making a vital contribution to the success of the fifa world cup , and above all to the fans and the visitors .

less than two hours before the nuptials , several thousand people , some waving union jack flags and hats , lined the picturesque streets under blue skies to catch a glimpse of the new royal couple . in comparison , around 600,000 turned out in london in july 1981 when charles wedded diana inside the domed splendour of st paul 's cathedral . " the sun is shining .
the crowds are filling the streets .
it 's going to be a wonderful day , " said paddy harverson , the prince of wales 's communications director , on bbc radio , as the bride and groom made their way to windsor . quick , closed ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william .
charles and parker bowles , both divorcees , were declared man and wife by local registrar clair williams in a private 20-minute ceremony in the guildhall before 28 specially invited guests and no media at all . the couple 's eldest sons by their previous marriages , prince william and tom parker bowles , acted as witnesses .
notable by their absence , however , were the groom 's parents : queen elizabeth ii and prince philip .
after the wedding a televised 45-minute anglican service of blessing in windsor castle , where the newlyweds - reading from the stern and uncompromising 1662 book of common prayer - are to " acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness " .
the mood is set to lighten up at an afternoon reception , also in windsor castle , at which more than 700 people had been invited , ranging from european royals to the likes of pop star sting . the couple are then due to slip away to scotland for a honeymoon on the royal estate of balmoral . " occasions like this bring the whole world together , " said wellwisher sheila parry , 67 , a retired farmer from south wales , who camped out next to the guildhall overnight to guarantee herself a good view of the wedding procession . " it is much quieter , but that is to be expected for a second marriage , " she added . wedding dogged by hitches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince of wales and his partner camilla parker bowles attend the mey games in caithness , scotland in this aug .

but many still hold the practical , country-loving parker bowles responsible for the break-up of charles ' marriage to the glamorous diana , who died in a paris car crash in 1997 , a year after her divorce from charles . saturday 's wedding , originally planned for the day before , was hastily rescheduled in order not to clash with the vatican funeral of pope john paul ii , attended by charles and prime minister tony blair , one of the guests at saturday 's blessing.the arrangements were dogged by glitches from the beginning , with the wedding venue being changed from windsor castle to the guildhall for licensing reasons and queen elizabeth opting not to be present when they tied the knot . a handful of royalty purists lodged objections right up to the wedding day , while a tabloid newspaper exposed security flaws by driving into windsor castle in a rented van with a fake bomb inside . even on saturday , charles woke up to see himself on the front pages of newspapers shaking hands at the pope 's funeral with zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is accused by the british government of gross human rights violations . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mention the wedding royalty-obsessed germans are getting a kick out of the troubled wedding preparations for britain 's prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

also , fifa announced that germany 's host cities will put on fan fests for the unlucky soccer addicts who did not get tickets . fifa took one on the chops this week after a judge in nuremberg , germany said the world 's soccer organization had no grounds to ban the one-piece uniforms of cameroon .
german sportsgear company puma , who developed and supplied the sleek uniforms for the african team , sued fifa at a german court and demanded two million euros -lrb- $ 2.59 million -rrb- in damages . the controversy started when fifa banned the kit during the african nations cup in 2004 .
puma spokesman ulf santjer said during the proceedings that fifa had known of the kit over nine months before the cup started in tunisia .
not until the tournament commenced did trouble brew and fifa announced the ban . cameroon continued to wear the uniform , was subsequently fined 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 150,000 -rrb- and more importantly , had six points deducted in their world cup 2006 qualifying campaign .
puma paid the fine and fifa later rescinded that second decision at the behest of the african football federation but stuck to its ban on the cat suit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chairman jochen zeitz and his company puma had the courage to tangle with fifa puma then took fifa to court .
in her ruling , judge ingrid kefer said that yes , fifa had stated in its rules that a player 's uniform must consist of shorts and jerseys . " it is not written anywhere that the two can not be connected , " kefer added . puma has charged their bigger competitors adidas of nudging fifa to punish cameroon for the modern uniform .
adidas has denied the allegations . kefer did not allow puma to introduce any such evidence of influence by adidas .
however , she did not understand why fifa objects to the uniforms which she stated served a " good purpose . "
the shorts can not be pulled down by an opponent and the " unappetizing exchange of jerseys " would no longer be possible . fifa legal director heinz tännler now has four weeks to react to the court 's arguments .
" it 's not over until it 's over .
nothing has been decided yet , " he told reporters . the final decision is not far off .
kefer will read her verdict on june 1 . fifa announces fan fests meanwhile , fans from around the globe have submitted over ten million applications for the lottery of tickets to next year 's world cup in germany .
unfortunately , there are only 812,000 available which means that millions of people will come away empty-handed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you may need the luck of a leprechaun if you hope to get a world cup ticket for those fans so unlucky as to lose out , there is the possibility to buy tickets from their own country 's soccer associations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.04.2005 debate flares up over minimum wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheaper labor from eastern europe is making germany jittery with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move . wages in germany plummeted by 1.2 percent following the entry of poland , the czech republic and the baltic states into the european union last year .
experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .
" that is why we will seek legislation that is both in line with eu rules and effective in curbing wage dumping in germany . " alarm over wage dumping under eu law , workers sent to a different country for a short-term contract must receive the minimum social benefits and wages of the state where they are carrying out the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this doesn ’ t apply , however , to self-employed workers and foreign subcontractors .
so in germany tens of thousands of workers in the meat industry have lost their jobs in recent months with their work now being done by companies from poland and hungary who essentially lend their foreign workers to companies here .
the wages they receive are just between 3 and 5 euros an hour . leading german trade union leaders such as ursula engelen-kefer speak of organized slave trade and demand minimum wages for most industrial sectors .
" we have to make sure that wage dumping and the loss of hard-won social standards must be prevented , " she said .
" we can only achieve that by introducing minimum wages in sectors beyond the german building industry where they already exist and are proving to be useful . " government against minimum wages quite naturally german employers are against an extension of minimum wages .
they say this would be counterproductive as job opportunities for unskilled german workers would be lost .
in addition they claim companies would be burdened with the costs of greater bureaucracy . strangely enough , germany ’ s social democrat-led government is supporting such views .
labor and economics minister wolfgang clement thinks the government should not interfere in well-balanced labor relations in such a way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " if minimum wages were to be introduced in all sectors there is the high risk that wages would automatically come down to these levels , " clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" so i can only warn all union and labor leaders against pushing for minimum wages . " but pressure is mounting on the government to do something about the risk of wages going into free fall in germany .
just last month , chancellor gerhard schröder had to intervene in eu plans to liberalize services which would have thrown the doors further open for cheap labor from the east . trade union leaders are convinced that minimum wages will remain on the agenda as fears of eastern laborers working for next to nothing in germany have long become reality . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.04.2005 focus turns to papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cardinals have a tough task on their hands for all its stately solemnity , the funeral friday of john paul ii means attention now moves to choosing a successor .
cardinals have more than a week to reflect before meeting for their secret conclave . as they ponder in the ornate surroundings of the vatican , the cardinals must weigh up a perplexing array of demands ranging from theological doctrine to skin color via inter-faith dialogue , contraception and attitudes to women and gays . but into weighty matters essentially reflecting sin and the soul comes an imponderable which perhaps two weeks ago could not have been foreseen - the immense outpouring of affection that john paul ii inspired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds pack st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , during the funeral mass for pope john paul ii .
if the cardinals were not aware before that they need a successor who will have an equally sure touch with the public , the millions of people around the world who mourned the pope 's death will have made it crystal clear . closeted reflection the conclave begins on april 18 .
from that afternoon on , after a solemn mass and swearing-in ceremony , the cardinal electors are cloistered away , barred from all communication with the outside world , until they choose a successor via a series of ballots in the sistine chapel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic bishops attend the funeral of pope john paul ii in the center of st. peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 .
there are 117 cardinals who fit the eligibility criteria of being aged less than 80 , but one of those , manila 's jaime sin , is ill and can not attend .
even now , though , they are not supposed to campaign , strike deals or reveal any of their or their fellow cardinals ' musings , on pain of excommunication . over the next week , the cardinals will hold a series of daily meetings - after all , they do still have to run the roman catholic church in the pope 's absence .
but it is the informal encounters , the quiet conversations , that may well settle voting intentions . such an atmosphere is a boon for ad hoc discussions and reflection panels , as well as allowing groups such as the highly conservative opus dei to sound out the mood . differing ideas of future pope from the philippines comes the strong message that a " liberal " pope is a definite no-no .
" if the pope is a liberal it is against the law of god , " says ramon arguelles , the archbishop of lipa , south of manila . the philippines is one of the few countries in the world where the majority of catholics broadly agree with vatican opposition to abortion , contraception and the ordination of women priests . in the united states , though , a recent survey found that 63 percent of us catholics believe that priests should be allowed to marry and more than three in four that the vatican should allow the use of birth control . from australia came a message from cardinal george pell , now in rome , that the next pontiff would follow the line taken by john paul ii who , for all his popularity , has left a staunchly conservative legacy . us cardinal francis george of chicago admitted earlier this week that " we may need a different kind of pope . "
his comments at a news conference - that while there were good reasons to elect a pope from a developing nation , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans " and speak italian - may indicate which way the wind may blow . a rash of favorites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian cardinal francis arinze according to the bookies , the favorites for the papal throne are cardinals dionigi tettamanzi of milan , northern italy , and francis arinze -lrb- photo -rrb- of nigeria . arinze would be only the church 's third african pope , and the first since gelatius i in the late fifth century , but observers find it difficult to see the cardinals going for such a revolution . john paul ii , after all , was the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries , and even he only came to the fore in 1978 after italian cardinals failed to unite around a single candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger other possible contenders include germany 's joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , the vatican 's doctrinal enforcer who delivered the homily at john paul ii 's funeral ; claudio hummes , the archbishop of sao paulo in brazil ; and honduran oscar rodriguez maradiaga . filling in oversized shoes what the church may well want is a safe , steady hand .
four years ago , a consistory of cardinals was asked to reflect on the key challenges facing the church in the 21st century at a time when congregations and faith appear to be declining in a rampantly commercial world .
when the conclave begins , the cardinals will be given a " meditation " which is expected to focus on some of those discussions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the late pope john paul ii gives his blessing .
and of course there is the personality factor - john paul ii drew tens of millions of people during a papal record-breaking 104 foreign trips , and his charisma drew millions again to rome to mourn his death . can the next pontiff keep that up ?
the cardinals will want to know . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .
-lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- the question of succession with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard .

the document , which was written in instalments over more than two decades , shows the pope considered resigning in 2000 .

experts believe that this trend will continue this year unless the german government takes decisive steps to curb the influx of cheap labor from eastern europe . the leader of germany ’ s opposition ultra-conservative csu party edmund stoiber has now said most of these workers are illegal immigrants who are violating eu rules governing self-employment and freedom to set up shop in the 25-nation bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel his call for the introduction of nationwide minimum wages was echoed by angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of germany ’ s conservative opposition .
" we can not compete for the lowest wages with countries such as estonia , latvia or poland , " merkel said .

less than two hours before the nuptials , several thousand people , some waving union jack flags and hats , lined the picturesque streets under blue skies to catch a glimpse of the new royal couple . in comparison , around 600,000 turned out in london in july 1981 when charles wedded diana inside the domed splendour of st paul 's cathedral . " the sun is shining .
the crowds are filling the streets .
it 's going to be a wonderful day , " said paddy harverson , the prince of wales 's communications director , on bbc radio , as the bride and groom made their way to windsor . quick , closed ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prince william .
charles and parker bowles , both divorcees , were declared man and wife by local registrar clair williams in a private 20-minute ceremony in the guildhall before 28 specially invited guests and no media at all . the couple 's eldest sons by their previous marriages , prince william and tom parker bowles , acted as witnesses .
notable by their absence , however , were the groom 's parents : queen elizabeth ii and prince philip .
after the wedding a televised 45-minute anglican service of blessing in windsor castle , where the newlyweds - reading from the stern and uncompromising 1662 book of common prayer - are to " acknowledge and bewail our manifold sins and wickedness " .
the mood is set to lighten up at an afternoon reception , also in windsor castle , at which more than 700 people had been invited , ranging from european royals to the likes of pop star sting . the couple are then due to slip away to scotland for a honeymoon on the royal estate of balmoral . " occasions like this bring the whole world together , " said wellwisher sheila parry , 67 , a retired farmer from south wales , who camped out next to the guildhall overnight to guarantee herself a good view of the wedding procession . " it is much quieter , but that is to be expected for a second marriage , " she added . wedding dogged by hitches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince of wales and his partner camilla parker bowles attend the mey games in caithness , scotland in this aug .

charles and parker bowles , who will take the title of duchess of cornwall , have had an intimate relationship going back more than 30 years , and in recent years have effectively lived as man and wife , often appearing together at official functions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's late princess diana , princess of wales .
but many still hold the practical , country-loving parker bowles responsible for the break-up of charles ' marriage to the glamorous diana , who died in a paris car crash in 1997 , a year after her divorce from charles . saturday 's wedding , originally planned for the day before , was hastily rescheduled in order not to clash with the vatican funeral of pope john paul ii , attended by charles and prime minister tony blair , one of the guests at saturday 's blessing.the arrangements were dogged by glitches from the beginning , with the wedding venue being changed from windsor castle to the guildhall for licensing reasons and queen elizabeth opting not to be present when they tied the knot . a handful of royalty purists lodged objections right up to the wedding day , while a tabloid newspaper exposed security flaws by driving into windsor castle in a rented van with a fake bomb inside . even on saturday , charles woke up to see himself on the front pages of newspapers shaking hands at the pope 's funeral with zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , who is accused by the british government of gross human rights violations . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do n't mention the wedding royalty-obsessed germans are getting a kick out of the troubled wedding preparations for britain 's prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

the high turnout - 78.9 % - was the only unpredictable element in the polls .
mr guelleh , who won 100 % of the ballots cast , told france 's le figaro newspaper he regretted " having no opponent " .
earlier on friday , police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters rallying against the elections who had set up a roadblock with burning tyres .
during his campaign , mr guelleh pledged to reduce poverty and the country 's dependence on food imports while boosting women 's rights and transparency in the public administration .
" i accuse the opposition of not having the courage to give voters the right to choose between several candidates , " the french paper quoted him as saying .
' afraid ' but the opposition has vowed not to accept his re-election .
" we would rather die standing than follow on our knees , " a banner read .
" it is meaningless to vote , " ali guedda boulsa told the afp news agency before mr guelleh 's victory was announced .
" our votes are never considered . "
after casting his ballot , mr guelleh said the opposition " were afraid to engage in the battle . "
he campaigned vigorously with most rallies held in the evening when the scorching afternoon temperatures of up to 45c had cooled .
he has been in power since winning elections in 1999 but says he will not stand again .
the only challenger withdrew last month citing a lack of funds .
a diplomat told the bbc 's mohammed adow in djibouti that , with the outcome not in doubt , the process itself would be closely watched .
the opposition accused the ruling coalition of rigging 2003 parliamentary elections in which it won all 65 seats .
earlier this year , the us criticised djibouti 's human rights record as " poor " .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- science books battle for aventis bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 9 april , 2005 , 08:02 gmt 09:02 uk science books battle for aventis six new science books are engaged in a very close race for the prestigious aventis prize , which celebrates the very best popular science writing .
panellists have said all the contenders this year are extremely strong , with any one of them capable of winning .
bill bryson , last year 's winner with his book a short history of nearly everything , chairs the panel , which features both the arts and sciences .
" some entries have even altered aspects of our outlook on life , " bryson said .
the shortlist for the adult prize includes robert winston and richard dawkins , as well as some less well known authors .
robert winston actually has entries in both the adult and the junior prize shortlists , which has never been done before .
best seller " we are trying to find a book that will appeal to the widest audience possible " lisa burke , judging panel the general prize winner will take home the tidy sum of £ 10,000 , but the real reward is the massive sales which usually follow - bill bryson 's victorious book has been a runaway bestseller .
the winning book must be informative , readable and , most importantly , accessible to the general public .
" all the books are great in their own ways , but we are trying to find a book that will appeal to the widest audience possible , without patronising them , " said panellist lisa burke , who is a sky news weather presenter .
miss burke said that last year bill bryson 's book was a very obvious winner , but this year 's judges have a tougher job because the competition is very close .
" all the books bring up completely different issues which are relevant to us all today - and the quality is fantastic , " she told the bbc news website .
" i 'm finding it difficult because i have about three or four favourites so it is going to be very hard . "
she did hint that this year 's winner might not be in the traditional popular science book mould .
" we have had a spate of books on the universe and a spat of books on biology - so to have a slightly different angle on a scientific subject , just to bring uniqueness to it , would be great , " she said .
the winner of the aventis prize will be announced at a gala dinner on 12 may .
the full shortlist for the 2005 general prize : critical mass : how one thing leads to another , by philip ball -lrb- william heinemann -rrb- this book invites us to examine our own behaviour ; whether in buying the new harry potter book , voting for a particular party or responding to the lure of advertisers .
philip ball shows how much we can understand about human behaviour when we cease to try to predict and analyse the behaviour of individuals and instead look to the impact of hundreds , thousands or millions of individual human decisions .
the ancestor 's tale , by richard dawkins -lrb- weidenfeld & nicholson -rrb- this is a pilgrimage back through time - a journey that provides the setting for a collection of some 40 tales , each exploring an aspect of evolutionary biology through the stories of characters met along the way .
together they give an understanding of the processes which have shaped life on earth ; convergent evolution , the isolation of populations , continental drift and even the great extinctions .
why life speeds up as you get older by douwe draaisma -lrb- cambridge university press -rrb- where do the long , lazy summers of our childhood go ?
why is it that as we grow older time seems to condense , speed up , and elude us while in old age significant events from our distant past can seem as vivid and as real as that which happened yesterday ?
in the book , douwe draaisma , explores the nature of autobiographical memory and extraordinary phenomena such as déjà-vu , the memory feats of idiot-savants or the effects of extreme trauma on memory recall .
matters of substance : drugs - and why everyone 's a user by griffith edwards -lrb- penguin , allen lane -rrb- matters of substance presents a radical approach to the question of drug control .
examining the history of our relationship with the vast array of mind-acting drugs since the 14th century , edwards explores why drugs are as important to the global youth culture of the 21st century as they were in the 14th .
the earth : an intimate history by richard fortey -lrb- harpercollins -rrb- fortey introduces readers to the earth 's distinct character , revealing the life that it leads when humans are not watching .
he follows the continual movement of seabeds , valleys , mountain ranges and ice caps and shows how everything - our culture , natural history , even the formation of our cities - has its roots in geology .
the human mind by robert winston -lrb- bantam press / transworld publishers -rrb- winston tells us how our senses , emotions , personality , feelings and intelligence are the result of a ballet of genes and environment that shapes the path of our lives .
he explains how memories are formed and lost , how the ever-changing brain is responsible for toddler tantrums , teenage angst , the battle of the sexes , the insights gained from shakespeare , pirandello and larkin ; and the truth behind extra-sensory perception , déjà vu and out-of-body experiences .
the shortlist for the 2005 junior prize : kingfisher knowledge : endangered planet by david burnie -lrb- kingfisher -rrb- as humans continue to influence every habitat in the world , this book is a timely reminder of our responsibilities to preserve our fragile earth and to save the hundreds of species of animal and plant life which become extinct each year .
with digital artwork and information panels throughout , this is a book which hopes to inspire the younger generation to think about how to live in harmony with the planet and safeguard it for future generations .
mysteries and marvels of science by phillip clarke , laura howell and sarah khan -lrb- usborne -rrb- this book combines photography with illustrations to reveal the science behind everyday events in our world .
from the mysteries of atoms to the possibility of thinking robots and machines the size of sand grains , this book aims to inspire and stimulate the scientists of tomorrow .
leap through time : earthquake by nicholas harris -lrb- orpheus -rrb- this book takes its readers on a journey , from the initial rumbles of an earthquake to the violent shaking , the toppling of buildings , the collapse of bridges and the vast waves which engulf the shore .
as each page is turned , the story moves on by a few seconds , a few minutes , a few hours or even a few years to record the consequences of the earthquake and the rebuilding process needed to return to normality .
night sky atlas by robin scagell -lrb- dorling kindersley -rrb- this practical book takes readers on a journey across the night sky , bringing the subject to life with easy-to-follow guides to understanding and recognising the most obscure night sky phenomena .
with space photography , see-through pages and detailed diagrams pinpointing constellations and fascinating stars , this book is perfect for any budding astronomer .
kingfisher knowledge : microscopic life by richard walker -lrb- kingfisher -rrb- winner of the aventis junior prize in 2002 , richard walker makes another appearance on the short-list with his guide to exploring the miniature world all around us .
microscopic life investigates the tiny creatures that live around us , inside us and even on us - creatures so small they can not be seen without microscopes .
what makes me , me ? by robert winston -lrb- dorling kindersley -rrb- this is the first children 's book to attempt to unravel how biology and experience make each person individually themselves .
questions such as " why do we have hairy fingers ? " , " which of my parents is to blame for my fear of spiders ? " and " why are some people left-handed ? " are all debated and discussed .
the book tells the story of the human mind and body from a child 's point of view , while the tests and quizzes make reading the book an interactive experience and help children to see how the information relates back to themselves .

leap through time : earthquake by nicholas harris -lrb- orpheus -rrb- this book takes its readers on a journey , from the initial rumbles of an earthquake to the violent shaking , the toppling of buildings , the collapse of bridges and the vast waves which engulf the shore .

what makes me , me ? by robert winston -lrb- dorling kindersley -rrb- this is the first children 's book to attempt to unravel how biology and experience make each person individually themselves .
questions such as " why do we have hairy fingers ? " , " which of my parents is to blame for my fear of spiders ? " and " why are some people left-handed ? " are all debated and discussed .
the book tells the story of the human mind and body from a child 's point of view , while the tests and quizzes make reading the book an interactive experience and help children to see how the information relates back to themselves .

spring wedding describes the marriage as a " piece of news " , while he talks of the " scandal-flywheel whirring round " .
the troubled history of the pair 's relationship is also dealt with .
mr motion told the bbc he had tried to acknowledge the range of feelings people felt about the marriage .
he said the relationship " was now running its proper course " and he had used the image of a stream to convey the difficulties the couple had faced .
prince charles had sent him a letter , and the couple " seemed to like it very much " , he added .
andrew motion has been poet laureate since 1999 .
spring wedding i took your news outdoors , and strolled a while in silence on my square of garden-ground where i could dim the roar of arguments , ignore the scandal-flywheel whirring round , and hear instead the green fuse in the flower ignite , the breeze stretch out a shadow-hand to ruffle blossom on its sticking points , the blackbirds sing , and singing take their stand .
i took your news outdoors , and found the spring had honoured all its promises to start disclosing how the principles of earth can make a common purpose with the heart .
the heart which slips and sidles like a stream weighed down by winter-wreckage near its source - but given time , and come the clearing rain , breaks loose to revel in its proper course .

spring wedding describes the marriage as a " piece of news " , while he talks of the " scandal-flywheel whirring round " .
the troubled history of the pair 's relationship is also dealt with .
mr motion told the bbc he had tried to acknowledge the range of feelings people felt about the marriage .
he said the relationship " was now running its proper course " and he had used the image of a stream to convey the difficulties the couple had faced .
prince charles had sent him a letter , and the couple " seemed to like it very much " , he added .
