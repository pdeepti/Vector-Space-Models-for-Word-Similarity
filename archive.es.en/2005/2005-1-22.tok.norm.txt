the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .

viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .

in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .
let 's try it vs. let 's think about it cultural differences explain why responses to self-employment vary according to continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .

german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .

it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .

it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "

he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report .

german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report .

german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .

south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .

it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 opinion : celebrating einstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous man with an equally famous tongue everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied . since germany is making this year " einstein year " to honor the 100th anniversary of the invention of the physicist 's theory of relativity , people are bound to ask themselves every now and then , exactly what the fascination surrounding this genius is all about .
exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 germans do n't want the corner office großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans would rather be the employee than the employer fear of failure makes europeans happier to be cashing regular paychecks than starting their own business .
americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .
let 's try it vs. let 's think about it cultural differences explain why responses to self-employment vary according to continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .
" though the media only talks about the bankruptcies , there are still more companies founded than closed in germany , " he added . michael knigge -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new york art project made in germany ever since they shrouded berlin 's reichstag , most germans know artist duo christo and jeanne-claude .
germany plays a role in their latest work in new york too , this time weaving and stitching their trademark fabric .

in germany , many people are rethinking their relationship between work and free time .
but what 's the recipe for success ?

14 , 2004 -rrb- the end of the german start-up ?
in recent years , germany has become less than fertile ground for start-up companies , as entrepreneurs have struggled to find funding .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 germans do n't want the corner office großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most europeans would rather be the employee than the employer fear of failure makes europeans happier to be cashing regular paychecks than starting their own business .
americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .
let 's try it vs. let 's think about it cultural differences explain why responses to self-employment vary according to continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .
" though the media only talks about the bankruptcies , there are still more companies founded than closed in germany , " he added . michael knigge -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new york art project made in germany ever since they shrouded berlin 's reichstag , most germans know artist duo christo and jeanne-claude .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .
let 's try it vs. let 's think about it cultural differences explain why responses to self-employment vary according to continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .

german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 opinion : celebrating einstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous man with an equally famous tongue everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied . since germany is making this year " einstein year " to honor the 100th anniversary of the invention of the physicist 's theory of relativity , people are bound to ask themselves every now and then , exactly what the fascination surrounding this genius is all about .
exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 who backs german aids drug despite fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the benefits outweigh side effects the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- approved viramune , an anti-aids drug , on thursday , despite warnings from the us food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- that the medicine could cause liver damage . the who said it would not change its policy on viramune because the advantages from the drug outweighed any side effects that might be caused by the drug .
viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .
achmat says the fda findings are nothing new and that all antiretroviral drugs are known to have side effects , including liver damage . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reveal new weapon against hiv german researchers have developed a new treatment for hiv , the virus that causes aids .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 who backs german aids drug despite fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the benefits outweigh side effects the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- approved viramune , an anti-aids drug , on thursday , despite warnings from the us food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- that the medicine could cause liver damage . the who said it would not change its policy on viramune because the advantages from the drug outweighed any side effects that might be caused by the drug .
viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .
achmat says the fda findings are nothing new and that all antiretroviral drugs are known to have side effects , including liver damage . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reveal new weapon against hiv german researchers have developed a new treatment for hiv , the virus that causes aids .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .

kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .

in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .
" though the media only talks about the bankruptcies , there are still more companies founded than closed in germany , " he added . michael knigge -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new york art project made in germany ever since they shrouded berlin 's reichstag , most germans know artist duo christo and jeanne-claude .

in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .
let 's try it vs. let 's think about it cultural differences explain why responses to self-employment vary according to continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : götz werner founded the first dm drugstore in 1973 " there are cultural differences between germans and americans , " götz w. werner -lrb- photo -rrb- , founder of german drugstore chain dm , told dw-world.de.
" americans say , ' let 's try it , ' a german wants to consider all the possibilities first - that 's why germans often lack boldness . "
werner has never had a problem with boldness .
he founded his first dm drugstore in 1973 and today heads the chain with stores in nine european countries and a total revenue of over € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.88 billion -rrb- .
fear of failure keeps 61 percent of germans from building on promising business ideas , with only the portuguese - by 1 percent - being warier of starting a company . more than half of europeans and one third of americans agreed with the sentence , " you should not found a company when there is a chance it could fail , " according to the eu report . " someone needs to slow americans down and give germans a kick forward , " werner said in response to the study 's results .
no second chance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extreme consequences keep germans looking in on new projects instead of starting them while life goes on for americans who founded unsuccessful businesses , one flop can mean the end of a german 's business career , according to christoph müller an economics professor at hohenheim university .
german credit institutes often ask applicants if there is a failed company in their background , and if there is " they do n't need to bother filling out the application forms , " müller said .
that plays a role in why just over half of europeans said they would rather be employed in a company than run it , while 34 percent of americans would rather own a company than work for it .
in comparison with the united states , germany still has some catching up to do when it comes to starting up businesses , but the situation is not as bad as many believe - and it 's crucial to talk about the quality of companies , not just the quantity .
statistically speaking , turkey and greece have loads of small businesses , but because these nations rely heavily on the agriculture sector they do not produce the same revenues as less agriculturally dependent countries , according to müller .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .

the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 opinion : celebrating einstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous man with an equally famous tongue everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied . since germany is making this year " einstein year " to honor the 100th anniversary of the invention of the physicist 's theory of relativity , people are bound to ask themselves every now and then , exactly what the fascination surrounding this genius is all about .
exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 opinion : celebrating einstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous man with an equally famous tongue everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied . since germany is making this year " einstein year " to honor the 100th anniversary of the invention of the physicist 's theory of relativity , people are bound to ask themselves every now and then , exactly what the fascination surrounding this genius is all about .
exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .

the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .
achmat says the fda findings are nothing new and that all antiretroviral drugs are known to have side effects , including liver damage . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reveal new weapon against hiv german researchers have developed a new treatment for hiv , the virus that causes aids .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 who backs german aids drug despite fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the benefits outweigh side effects the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- approved viramune , an anti-aids drug , on thursday , despite warnings from the us food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- that the medicine could cause liver damage . the who said it would not change its policy on viramune because the advantages from the drug outweighed any side effects that might be caused by the drug .
viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .
achmat says the fda findings are nothing new and that all antiretroviral drugs are known to have side effects , including liver damage . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reveal new weapon against hiv german researchers have developed a new treatment for hiv , the virus that causes aids .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .

but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .

einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?

he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .

south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .

last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .

south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .

south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?
on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

americans , on the other hand , are more likely to want to be their own boss , according to an eu report . the european union 's report showing 61 percent of americans want to be their own boss compared to 45 percent of europeans comes after five years of surveying more than 21,000 americans and europeans about their feelings toward self-employment .

the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner on saturday told the german bild am sonntag newspaper that ultimately the european union and the united states were striving for the same outcome in the discussions with and about iran . “ negotiations will be difficult , but i firmly believe that diplomatic efforts will be successful , ” the commissioner was quoted as saying . “ i base this on the fact that no one could underestimate the consequences of a military strike – not only on the region but also on relations between the islamic world and the west , ” the austrian politician in brussels said . threats or diplomacy ? a week ago , us president george w. bush raised quite a few eyebrows and ignited a new round of discussion in europe when he said he could not rule out using force if tehran failed to rein in its nuclear plans , which he claims is a cover for the production of a nuclear bomb .
it is also no secret that bush considers iran one of the chief players in the axis of evil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president khatami and saddam hussein - from one dictator to the next ?

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .

on thursday , vice president dick cheney said iran was “ right at the top of the list ” of global trouble spots .
he also said iran was “ a noted sponsor of terror . ” despite such strong statements , the eu has been reluctant to outwardly criticize the us .
it is still not clear to what extent washington intends to make a direct threat of force to coerce iran into abandoning its nuclear program . “ i am not sure that president bush made a direct threat , ” ferrero-waldner acknowledged in the bild am sonntag interview .
she added : “ vice president -lrb- dick -rrb- cheney said that the diplomatic solution would be the best solution . ” “ the european union and the united states have the same aim : to prevent iran from getting hold of a nuclear weapons , and they both want a peaceful solution , ” she said . the only difference between brussels and washington is in establishing priorities .
the europeans prefer to offer encouragement and support for the more moderate politicians in iran , while the us opts for a faster and tougher approach . britain , france and germany have been conducting ongoing negotiations with tehran since mid-december to try to conclude a long-term deal whereby iranians would definitively give up any ambitions of producing nuclear weapons , in exchange for better trade agreements . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians worried about us ' iran stance german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .

in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .
a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .

the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

a spokeswoman for boehringer said they do not expect any major changes on their sales or from doctors as a result of the warning from the fda .
and there will be no influence on the donation program or the continuing supply of the drug to developing countries at reduced prices .
controversy from south africa in south africa , viramune is a sensitive issue .
south africa has the world 's highest caseload of hiv and aids .
the country has about 5 million infected people , out of a population of 45 million .
activists estimate about 600 people die daily from hiv and aids-related disease .
south african health officials and activists involved in the fight against aids have stood by viramune .
however , the ruling political party , the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- , said the fda warning about the drug proved its concerns about using viramune were valid .
last month the anc sparked controversy by accusing us officials and boehringer of hiding the side effects of viramune .
the charges were disputed by us authorities .
the fda said cases of liver damage that produce rashes , fever or other symptoms were more common with viramune than with other anti-aids drugs .
it says no serious liver toxicity or deaths had been reported when a single dose was given to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hiv virus .
in 2003 viramune had sales of over € 300 million , making it boehringer 's sixth-biggest drug .
zackie achmat , the head of the south africa 's leading aids lobby is himself on antiretroviral treatment and agrees with an official from doctors without borders , who said no drug is perfect .

viramune , also known generically as nevirapine , is an anti-aids drug produced by boehringer ingelheim , germany 's top drugmaker in terms of sales .
boehringer provides the drug free of charge to poor countries as an antiretroviral which prevents mother-to-child transmission of hiv , and said they will not stop this practice .
on wednesday the fda revised the side effects warnings and said doctors should weigh benefits and risks before prescribing viranume .
the drug has been linked to some deaths , including those of pregnant women .
viramune is offered free in some developing countries through a " viramune donation program " run by boehringer as a way to prevent hiv transmission from mother-to-child .
it is also part of a subsidized anti-aids cocktail used as a continuous therapy .

exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?

instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.01.2005 opinion : celebrating einstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a famous man with an equally famous tongue everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied . since germany is making this year " einstein year " to honor the 100th anniversary of the invention of the physicist 's theory of relativity , people are bound to ask themselves every now and then , exactly what the fascination surrounding this genius is all about .
exactly why , compared to many other 20th century experts , is this scientist considered an idol , a pop icon , and at the same time a citizen of the world , a rebel and a pacifist ? while names like pointcare , heisenberg and bohr are little known to anything more than a small group of experts , albert einstein enjoys almost global fame and reverence .
even during his lifetime , he was a media star , for whom it proved possible to remain in touch with the world public in spite of his highly specialized scientific activity . it is possible that his popularity was connected to the fact that nobody was really able to explain his theories .
instead it was his whims , his unconventional ways and his trademark wild hair which were the focus of media reports . equipped with a good dose of self-irony and a quick wit , after he was awarded the nobel prize , einstein mocked himself with the words " from now on i 'm a model ! "
it was one way he groomed his fame . paradoxical figure in the 1920s , einstein was as much an attraction in berlin as the city zoo , the palace , or the double-decker busses .
but this man was not all sweetness and light .
the loveless manner in which he treated his wives , on whom he constantly cheated , and the neglect of his children was nothing short of heartless and would draw him seriously bad press in this day and age . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albert einstein played violin and loved music .
but in his time , more than anything , he nurtured his image of a reckless anarchist , who only managed to get behind so many secrets because he never lost his alleged childish naiveté . einstein , " the eternal child , " is a further puzzle piece which serves to make his myth even more dazzling .
but will the fuss surrounding this einstein year in germany help people to understand the genius any better , or will it distance him even further and mystify him more than is already the case ? what can we learn ? with numerous events , conferences and exhibitions scheduled to pay tribute to the man and his work , we should be asking ourselves what can we learn from this genius .
for one thing , einstein showed us that scientists should definitely be interested in what political leaders do with the results of their research . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1999 , us magazine " time " named einstein the most important man of the century .
einstein may have been involved in the development of the us atomic bomb , but only in order to put an end to nazi megalomania .
he later fully rejected the bomb . we can also see that his unconventional career as self-confident lateral thinker and autodidact , and his belief in independent rather than institutionalized thought , led to ground-breaking discoveries . would that be possible today ?
many experts say no and point out the complexities of modern physics .
but the interdisciplinary approach remains valid . more than anything else , this einstein year should be a chance to question the significance of research in germany today .
does it get enough financial backing from the political world ?
affected research institutes would answer that although there is more on offer than in times gone by , it is still not enough , not least because public research contributions are in decline .
so what would einstein make of this simultaneous celebration of himself and reluctance to open the state budget purse a little wider for the sake of innovation ?
he 'd probably just poke his tongue out at us from his grave . verica spasovska -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering einstein 's legacy chancellor schroeder called for a " culture of science " to encourage german innovation and technology as the country kicked off celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of albert einstein 's death .

either the industry applies self-regulation or faces legislation , says the eu . over the past months , the european commission has been debating possible self-regulatory measures within the food industry to curb what is rapidly becoming an alarming obesity problem among the bloc ’ s children . markos kyprianou , the eu commissioner for health and consumer affairs warned makers of junk food – those products high in sugar , salt or fat content - that unless they agree to voluntary reductions in advertising to children and clear labeling of their products , the eu executive is prepared to force them into it with stiff new regulations . “ we made fun of the americans in a way .
we used to regard obesity as only and american problem .
today obesity is on the rise in europe , especially among children .
i am concerned that advertising of foods high in fat , sugar , and salt should not target vulnerable consumers like children , ” the commissioner wrote in thursday ’ s financial times and vowed to tackle the issue during his time in office . europe ’ s expanding girth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste for junk food begins early given the evidence collected across the 25-member union , pro-active measures are desperately needed , especially where children are concerned .
according to a recent report by the british parliament , more than 50 percent of british children will be obese by 2020 .
in italy 36 percent of nine-year-olds are overweight ; in spain 27 percent of children and youth have too many extra pounds .
in southern europe , one in three children are clinically obese . moreover , the eu estimates that up to 8 percent of national health budgets are spent tackling what is quickly turning into an epidemic . in order to curb european eating habits , kyprianou said cooperation with the food industry was crucial .
speaking to the ft , the newly inaugurated commissioner said the food producers themselves are the fastest and most effective means to cutting out the fat . in march , the commission is expected to announce a new arrangement with the food industry that would outline self-regulatory targets to go into effect by the end of the year .
in addition to “ clear labeling understandable to a consumer who doesn ’ t have a phd in chemistry , ” kyprianou said he wanted to see a significant reduction of the amount of junk food advertising directed at children . targeting children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which kid can resist the sweet jelly taste of plump gummi bears ?
children are a hugely attractive target market for advertisers , no matter how many restrictions are imposed on what they can and can not market .
according to nielsen media research in the uk , which examined monthly estimates from tv stations , the estimated total amount of money spent by the top 10 food advertisers in 2003 was € 31.8 million -lrb- $ 41.4 million -rrb- , almost a 40 percent increase on the previous year . ofcom , an official regulator of the eu , said that 70 percent of children are exposed to junk food ads between 6:00pm and 9:00pm , during the so-called family time slots .
kyprianou said he wants junk food ads banned completely during these prime time slots . “ the signs from the industry are very encouraging , very positive .
but if this doesn ’ t produce satisfactory results , we will proceed with legislation , ” he said . in britain , where such calls to ban junk food ads aimed specifically at kids has already been embraced by the government in a recent “ white paper , ” public health minister melanie johnson , said her country would push for faster results in the area when it takes over the rotating eu presidency in june . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

27 is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims . january 27 marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the nazi death camp auschwitz by allied forces .
to commemorate the event , ceremonies will be held throughout europe , israel and the us .
in new york on monday , the united nations , for the first time in its history , will pay tribute to the millions of people who suffered in the holocaust . in germany , the historic moment when soviet forces freed the infamous auschwitz-birkenau camp in poland in 1945 will be remembered throughout the country .
on friday , a week before the anniversary , the state parliament in saxony paid tribute to the victims of the nazis – some six million jews – with a moment of silence . instead of being a solemn moment of reflection , the tribute turned into a political bashing as 12 regional lawmakers for the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- refused to participate and stormed out of the chamber . earlier in the week the npd , which rocked mainstream political parties in germany by winning a surprising 9.2 percent of the votes in last september ’ s state election , had filed a motion asking that the minute of silence be restricted to commemorate the victims of the allied bombing of dresden , saxony ’ s capital , in february 1945 .
the parliament overwhelmingly rejected the request . insidious historical revisionism cornelius weiss , senior parliamentarian and parliamentary group leader for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , said the proposal was unacceptable .
“ we must never forget the hell of dresden , but neither must we forget how we got to that point , ” he told the parliamentarians and listed such historical factors as adolf hitler seizing power in 1933 , the holocaust , concentration camps and the german bombing of british cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an allied bombing raid on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 left downtown dresden in ruins .
in the motion to focus only on dresden , npd ’ s parliamentary group leader holger apfel justified the request by referring to the destruction of the baroque city as a “ bombing holocaust . ”
the rest of the parliament booed the npd ’ s statements and walked out of the chamber .
when apfel referred to the allied attacks on germany as “ mass murder ” and the current policy of the us and britain as organized by “ gangsters , ” his microphone was turned off . a day after the event , the central council of jews in germany responded to the npd ’ s outburst with harsh words .
“ there is no excuse and no justification for such insidious remarks , ” it said in a statement .
the bombing raid on dresden can not be compared to the holocaust .
to do so is a grotesque rewriting of history and belittles the deaths of millions of jews , the council said . the npd is a slap in the face to all established parties and all democrats well beyond saxony , the statement said .
the council said the events in saxony ’ s parliament and the rise in popularity for right-wing parties showed that “ anti-semitism and racial hatred had now become socially acceptable . ” sullying germany ’ s image on saturday , german interior minister otto schily sharply criticized the npd .
“ we can not allow for such statements to go unheeded and expose our youth to racist and unconstitutional ideas , ” he told german public broadcaster ard . the npd “ sullies the image of germany to such a degree that something worse is hardly imaginable , ” the minister exclaimed . claudia roth , co-chair of the greens party referred to the npd outburst as anti-semitic and racist and said such extreme right-wing ideologies needed to be vehemently countered by all democrats in germany .
the npd mocks and offends millions of people , the victims of nazi terror and its racial insanity , she said and called on the federal government to determine whether the npd violated the constitution . new grounds for party ban ? “ the speech by the npd offers new material to bring forth a case to ban the party , ” said peter porsch , fraction leader of the post-communist party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- . in the past the federal government has been unable to succeed in banning the npd on grounds that it undermines the german constitution by maintaining close ties to neo-nazi circles .
the most recent attempt to outlaw the party failed in march 2003 after the federal constitutional court ruled the use of undercover informants created bias in the government 's attempt to ban the npd . the informants - federal intelligence agents - were also unwilling to disclose their identity by appearing in court . since then , berlin has been unable to stop the growth and spread of the party , particularly in the former east , where it has fed on local frustration with unemployment and the reduction of social welfare payments . the party ’ s speech in saxony ’ s parliament will now be examined to determine grounds for new legal action against the npd , the state attorney general in dresden said . the greens and conservative christian democrats have said the statements should be viewed as a call to racial hatred .
karl-heinz gerstenberg , state fraction leader for the greens , said the npd speech reeked of racial insults and extreme right-wing ideology . preaching racial hatred and denying the holocaust are both against the law in germany .
earlier in the week , germany called on the european union to adopt a ban on all nazi symbols . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's far-right parties join forces germany 's far-right groups , the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- , have officially joined forces to fight the 2006 general election as one .

the nappy outreach worker will speak to parents at ante-natal classes , plus meet midwives and health professionals to raise awareness about washable nappies .
the scheme is funded by savings on landfill costs - expected to be £ 23,000 - if 600 people swap from disposable nappies to washable ones .

the rise was the uk 's second largest in 2004 .

halifax chief economist martin ellis said : " affordability has become a serious issue making it very difficult for those looking to get on the housing ladder for the first time .

halifax chief economist martin ellis said : " affordability has become a serious issue making it very difficult for those looking to get on the housing ladder for the first time .
" this is highlighted by the sharp decline in the number of first-time buyers over the past two years to the lowest level since 1981 " .

the situation is expected to improve as earnings growth outstrips house price growth over the next few years making it easier for first time buyers to enter the market .

there are plans to erect a plaque in knighton , in its square which is named after the famous military leader .
research is being carried to see if the admiral actually visited the town in search of welsh oak .
a local historian has confirmed that thousands of the trees from the area went to help construct the world 's largest navy .
members of knighton town forum are due to hold a meeting to discuss the issue and intends to unveil the plaque on the 200th anniversary of trafalgar on 23 october .
horatio nelson saved britain from the threat of invasion by napoleon , but died in battle at trafalgar in 1805 . "
we 're researching the possibility that nelson actually visited the town " roger bright chairman of the town forum , roger bright , said : " we want to use welsh slate and officially recognise nelson square .
many people new to the town do n't know about its link to the famous admiral .
" we 're researching the possibility that nelson actually visited the town , because we know a lot of welsh oak was used from this area to build ships for the royal navy .
" it 's possible that the square was just named after nelson , but we plan to unveil a plaque anyway . "
mr bright , knighton 's former mayor , added : " we plan to unveil the plaque on the 200th anniversary of trafalgar in october . "
but local historian keith parker from nearby presteigne is not convinced nelson visited the town .
" thousands of welsh oaks from powys were used to build ships because other areas had run out .
oaks in other areas had been used to power metal smelting , " mr parker said .
" parts of the old county of radnorshire and the wye valley were untouched .
plus , there was an outpouring of patriotic zeal around nelson 's time and everybody was proud of the man . "
mr parker , the author of two local history books , added : " i ca n't confirm that nelson actually visited knighton . "
nelson , who was the son of a clergyman , joined the navy at the age of 12 , became a captain when he was 20 , and saw service in the west indies , the baltic and canada .
over the period 1794 to 1805 , under nelson 's leadership , the british navy proved its supremacy over the french in a series of battles .

about a thousand operations out of the 178,000 procedures carried out are now rescheduled due to emergencies - about 20 every week .
hospital managers say the number of delayed operations has been reduced due to better planning .
the announcement comes a week after a bed shortage caused routine operations to be postponed for three days .
earliest moment ron calvert , director of operations at the university hospitals of leicester nhs trust said : " your chances of being cancelled on the day of surgery when you 're scheduled to come in are less than half a per cent .
" we could achieve a lower figure than that but it would mean people having to wait longer in the first place .
" what we 're trying to do is maximise the number of people we can give an operation to at the earliest possible moment . "
hospital managers also said they are continuing to work with doctors to plan for and reduce emergency admissions .
