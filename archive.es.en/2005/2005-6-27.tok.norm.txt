but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .

today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .
raised hopes germany has been part of a campaign with brazil , india and japan to get permanent seats on the council though it has withdrawn demands for a veto on resolutions that the five current permanent members get .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , bush take questions in the oval office after their meeting the united states has so far only endorsed japan to join britain , china , france , russia and the united states as a permanent member .
" i was very pleased indeed to hear that there was no opposition , vis-a-vis germany as such , from the president , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters after the meeting .
" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .

watchful eye on iran " as we say in texas , ' this wo n't be his first rodeo ' , " commented bush when asked about the chancellor 's election hopes .
the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .
raised hopes germany has been part of a campaign with brazil , india and japan to get permanent seats on the council though it has withdrawn demands for a veto on resolutions that the five current permanent members get .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , bush take questions in the oval office after their meeting the united states has so far only endorsed japan to join britain , china , france , russia and the united states as a permanent member .
" i was very pleased indeed to hear that there was no opposition , vis-a-vis germany as such , from the president , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters after the meeting .
" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder exits the white house after the meeting the white house meeting added momentum to the washington-berlin thaw after their dispute over iraq .
bush and schröder last met in germany in february .
they will meet again at the g8 industrial powers ' summit in scotland next week .
schröder needs good news as germany will hold a general election in september and schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- trails the conservative christian democrats in opinion polls .
watchful eye on iran " as we say in texas , ' this wo n't be his first rodeo ' , " commented bush when asked about the chancellor 's election hopes .
the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "
the united states has threatened to seek un security council sanctions against iran if the talks with the european states fail . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a -lrb- not so -rrb- fond farewell ?

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .

and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .

since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

" i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .

" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .
" and it 's tough when you 're 1-0 up then the other side gets an equalizer , we had to work hard to hold off argentina .
on top of that we were getting tired . " positive signs for world cup 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the winner against brazil .
lavolpe and mexico head home to prepare for the final push towards qualifying for germany next year with the satisfaction of having beaten japan and brazil in the group stages . but the latter stages of their confed cup campaign was overshadowed by the expulsion of two key players - aaron galindo and salvador carmona - on suspicion of having taken the banned steroid nandrolene . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina in final after penalty drama argentina will face brazil in the 2005 confederations cup final on june 29 after beating mexico 6-5 on penalties on sunday .

this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .

the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .
mexico though replied swiftly and fonseca equalised.the build up to their second goal through schweinsteiger was probably germanys best goal in the klinsmann era and involved some delicate passing .
mexico to their credit fought back and equalised just after half-time through borghetti .
germany suddenly found themselves down to 10 men after maik hanke was sent off for a harsh foul .
robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .
surely this would be the winning goal ... however , there was more to come . mexico won a free-kick on the edge of the german box and up rises borghetti to score his second goal ... 3-3 the score ... kahn beaten for the third time.the match goes into extra time and with both sides going all out to win ... it was michael ballack who got germanys winner from a beautifully executed free-kick .
so , what have germany learned from this competition ?
after conceding 11 goals in these five matches they know that they have to do something about their defence .
jürgen klinsmann though has brought the smiles back to german football .
his new methods , among them american fitness coaches seem to be having a positive effect on the squad indeed , the players look happy ... the fans are happy .
and although third place may not be what the supporters had been hoping for klinnsman's side has shown that they are ready to challenge the giants of world football next year . alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" in my view , we must carry out commitments , even if they are unpopular , " fischer told a meeting of polish diplomats in warsaw , according to reuters .
" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one . " earlier on monday , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the eu should suspend enlargement after letting bulgaria and romania in following the french and dutch voters ' rejection of the eu constitution , in what appeared to be a reference to turkey 's eu entry bid . the polish capital warsaw is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from germany , france britain and poland in an effort to break the deadlock in the aftermath of the failed european union summit earlier this month .
according to polish diplomats , warsaw is keen to play the role of a mediator in the conflict concerning the future of eu reforms and budget . charm offensive at the same time , france and britain this week are launching separate charm offensives among the new eu member states of central and eastern europe to push for their very different visions of the bloc 's future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with fischer french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy and british european affairs minister douglas alexander are both in warsaw bidding to influence the polish position in the budget negotiations of the months ahead . on friday , france 's european affairs minister catherine colonna flies to budapest on the first of a series of visits which a foreign ministry spokesman in paris said are " intended to display our particular attention to the new member states .

alexander and british deputy prime minister john prescott are also planning several visits to the new members , as their country begins its six-month presidency of the european union . the rival diplomatic initiatives are part of the fall-out of the brussels summit , in which britain lost capital among its traditional allies in central and eastern europe by appearing as the prime culprit for the blockage of the post-2007 budget . if london sees it as an urgent priority to smooth over the difficulties by promising early action on the budget under its presidency , france believes it has an opportunity to recover some of its lost standing in the region . capping cap ? the french ministers are likely to lay stress on the shared interest that france and many of the new members have in sustaining the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which has been under attack as exorbitant and outmoded by british prime minister tony blair .
in his visit to poland monday , douste-blazy will have the backing of his german counterpart fischer who will join tripartite talks with polish foreign minister adam rotfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair speaking to meps at the european parliament in brussels it was at poland 's initiative that the 10 new member states suggested at the brussels summit that their eu allocations be reduced if that would make it easier to reach a budget deal .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .
" and it 's tough when you 're 1-0 up then the other side gets an equalizer , we had to work hard to hold off argentina .
on top of that we were getting tired . " positive signs for world cup 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the winner against brazil .

" that was n't one of our best matches , " pekerman conceded after esteban cambiasso knocked in his spot-kick to hand argentina a 6-5 penalty win after the sides were deadlocked 1-1 after extra time .
" but my team has the capacity to produce a good performance against brazil . " shorter preparation time no disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have the luxury of an extra day 's recovery time having seen off germany in the other semi-final on saturday , but pekerman dismissed the notion that fatigue could count against argentina . " okay we 've got one day less before the final but my team are young and ambitious and i 'm sure we 'll be ready for brazil in two days time , " he said . as well as the lack of recovery time , the grey-haired former argentine youth coach will also have to make do without striker javier saviola after the monaco star was sent off after an ill-judged tackle on gonzalo pineda in the 90th minute . young and established stars producing the goods pekerman has used the confed cup to hand valuable international experience to players like goalkeeper german lux , who set up argentina 's win when he saved mexico 's sixth penalty taken by ricardo osorio . " saving that penalty represents an important stage in his career , " pekerman said . bildunterschrift : argentina 's goalkeeper german lux saves from mexico 's ricardo osorio in the penalty shootout argentine defender ricardo zanetti , who was making his 100th international appearance , added : " as expected it was a hard game but at the end we deserved to win . " team spirit carries argentina on pekerman believes that despite his team 's shortcomings there were plenty of positives to take from the game . " it was n't a great performance - there 's always a sense of drama in a game that will take you to the final , " he said .
" but we showed our fighting spirit , especially in the second half , and we kept our faith when we went a goal down .
the players came up with the answers in the end . " " we showed a lot of heart , " argentine captain juan pablo sorin added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2005 opinion : a -lrb- not so -rrb- fond farewell ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's washington summit with george bush could be his last summits are often nothing more than happy handshakes and empty photo ops , but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to the white house monday is likely to be a particularly egregious waste of jet fuel . if us president george bush has his druthers , this will be the last time he has to host gerhard schröder in washington dc .
with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .
schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .

" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .
schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .
-lrb- june 27 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .
raised hopes germany has been part of a campaign with brazil , india and japan to get permanent seats on the council though it has withdrawn demands for a veto on resolutions that the five current permanent members get .

" i was very pleased indeed to hear that there was no opposition , vis-a-vis germany as such , from the president , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters after the meeting .
" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .

watchful eye on iran " as we say in texas , ' this wo n't be his first rodeo ' , " commented bush when asked about the chancellor 's election hopes .
the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .
foreign firms , particularly german ones , hope this territory is home to other " planetary pearls .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .
raised hopes germany has been part of a campaign with brazil , india and japan to get permanent seats on the council though it has withdrawn demands for a veto on resolutions that the five current permanent members get .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , bush take questions in the oval office after their meeting the united states has so far only endorsed japan to join britain , china , france , russia and the united states as a permanent member .
" i was very pleased indeed to hear that there was no opposition , vis-a-vis germany as such , from the president , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters after the meeting .
" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder exits the white house after the meeting the white house meeting added momentum to the washington-berlin thaw after their dispute over iraq .
bush and schröder last met in germany in february .
they will meet again at the g8 industrial powers ' summit in scotland next week .
schröder needs good news as germany will hold a general election in september and schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- trails the conservative christian democrats in opinion polls .
watchful eye on iran " as we say in texas , ' this wo n't be his first rodeo ' , " commented bush when asked about the chancellor 's election hopes .
the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "
the united states has threatened to seek un security council sanctions against iran if the talks with the european states fail . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a -lrb- not so -rrb- fond farewell ?

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .
" we want workers to know that they 'll not be exposed to free falling , concerning their earnings in future . " confidence vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder on his return from washington this week , schröder was to inform the ruling coalition of his plans for a confidence vote friday in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament .
the vote is intended to clear the way for elections a year ahead of schedule . schröder called for new elections in may after the social democrats lost heavily in a regional election in their former stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , as core spd voters were put off by the government 's economic reforms . according to the latest polls , the social democrats are likely to get between 26 and 29 percent in a general election , compared to 45 and 49 percent for the conservative christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian players kaka , left , and ronaldinho , right , jubilate after kaka scored the second goal for brazil the world champions played jose pekermann's side off the park and goals by kaka , ronaldinho , and two by adriano put the issue beyond doubt .
adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .

robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .

adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .
mexico though replied swiftly and fonseca equalised.the build up to their second goal through schweinsteiger was probably germanys best goal in the klinsmann era and involved some delicate passing .
mexico to their credit fought back and equalised just after half-time through borghetti .
germany suddenly found themselves down to 10 men after maik hanke was sent off for a harsh foul .
robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .
surely this would be the winning goal ... however , there was more to come . mexico won a free-kick on the edge of the german box and up rises borghetti to score his second goal ... 3-3 the score ... kahn beaten for the third time.the match goes into extra time and with both sides going all out to win ... it was michael ballack who got germanys winner from a beautifully executed free-kick .
so , what have germany learned from this competition ?
after conceding 11 goals in these five matches they know that they have to do something about their defence .
jürgen klinsmann though has brought the smiles back to german football .
his new methods , among them american fitness coaches seem to be having a positive effect on the squad indeed , the players look happy ... the fans are happy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian players kaka , left , and ronaldinho , right , jubilate after kaka scored the second goal for brazil the world champions played jose pekermann's side off the park and goals by kaka , ronaldinho , and two by adriano put the issue beyond doubt .
adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .
mexico though replied swiftly and fonseca equalised.the build up to their second goal through schweinsteiger was probably germanys best goal in the klinsmann era and involved some delicate passing .
mexico to their credit fought back and equalised just after half-time through borghetti .
germany suddenly found themselves down to 10 men after maik hanke was sent off for a harsh foul .
robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .
surely this would be the winning goal ... however , there was more to come . mexico won a free-kick on the edge of the german box and up rises borghetti to score his second goal ... 3-3 the score ... kahn beaten for the third time.the match goes into extra time and with both sides going all out to win ... it was michael ballack who got germanys winner from a beautifully executed free-kick .
so , what have germany learned from this competition ?
after conceding 11 goals in these five matches they know that they have to do something about their defence .
jürgen klinsmann though has brought the smiles back to german football .
his new methods , among them american fitness coaches seem to be having a positive effect on the squad indeed , the players look happy ... the fans are happy .

then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .

to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .

his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .
herzen had to give up his chef 's job for health reasons , and opted to go back to school in order to open up new opportunities for himself .
twice a week , when school lets out , he goes to work as a supermarket clerk . school , supermarket , bar " in the evenings , i also try to take a couple shifts behind the bar , " herzen said .

" in my view , we must carry out commitments , even if they are unpopular , " fischer told a meeting of polish diplomats in warsaw , according to reuters .
" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one . " earlier on monday , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the eu should suspend enlargement after letting bulgaria and romania in following the french and dutch voters ' rejection of the eu constitution , in what appeared to be a reference to turkey 's eu entry bid . the polish capital warsaw is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from germany , france britain and poland in an effort to break the deadlock in the aftermath of the failed european union summit earlier this month .
according to polish diplomats , warsaw is keen to play the role of a mediator in the conflict concerning the future of eu reforms and budget . charm offensive at the same time , france and britain this week are launching separate charm offensives among the new eu member states of central and eastern europe to push for their very different visions of the bloc 's future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with fischer french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy and british european affairs minister douglas alexander are both in warsaw bidding to influence the polish position in the budget negotiations of the months ahead . on friday , france 's european affairs minister catherine colonna flies to budapest on the first of a series of visits which a foreign ministry spokesman in paris said are " intended to display our particular attention to the new member states . "
alexander and british deputy prime minister john prescott are also planning several visits to the new members , as their country begins its six-month presidency of the european union . the rival diplomatic initiatives are part of the fall-out of the brussels summit , in which britain lost capital among its traditional allies in central and eastern europe by appearing as the prime culprit for the blockage of the post-2007 budget . if london sees it as an urgent priority to smooth over the difficulties by promising early action on the budget under its presidency , france believes it has an opportunity to recover some of its lost standing in the region . capping cap ? the french ministers are likely to lay stress on the shared interest that france and many of the new members have in sustaining the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which has been under attack as exorbitant and outmoded by british prime minister tony blair .
in his visit to poland monday , douste-blazy will have the backing of his german counterpart fischer who will join tripartite talks with polish foreign minister adam rotfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair speaking to meps at the european parliament in brussels it was at poland 's initiative that the 10 new member states suggested at the brussels summit that their eu allocations be reduced if that would make it easier to reach a budget deal .
the idea - described as " moving " by french president jacques chirac - came to nothing , because blair stuck to his position that britain would only discuss its rebate if chirac also agreed to put the cap on the negotiating table . " it is a good opening for us -lrb- with the new members -rrb- .
discussions with them are going to accelerate , " said a french diplomat .
" these countries are used to language from britain that is very pro-enlargement , but when it came to putting hands in wallets they were n't there .
the new members wo n't forget that , " he said . julie smith , analyst at the royal institute of international affairs in london said : " britain 's attitude has not gone down well with these countries .
france now has an opportunity to build up relations with them . " however guillaume durand of the european policy center in brussels warned that the current alignment may be only superficial .
the new members have not forgotten chirac 's contemptuous remarks when they offered support to the us over iraq that they had " missed an opportunity to keep quiet . " " above all they know that the french - who rejected the eu constitution on may 29 - have always been uneasy about enlargement , " he said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .

" the eu must do what it promised to do .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

and as the eu slipped into crisis following the failed referenda in france and the netherlands , he expressed his hope for a strong europe . but beneath the surface of the official courtesy , relations between this us administration and germany 's ruling coalition remain tense .

michael o 'hanlon of the political science research organization , brookings institution said that 's part of the problem . " our military in iraq is on the brink of collapse , " he said .
" france and germany have the capacity to help us if they want to , but we know they wo n't do that .
and president bush wo n't even bother addressing the issue although we could really do with the help . " bad taste lingers washington knows very well that germany is on the brink of a change of government , and members of the white house still clearly remember that schröder went into the last federal elections down on us policy on iraq . " it would have been okay if schröder had simply said , ' the war in iraq is a bad idea , that 's my position and i 'm sticking to it , " ' o 'hanlon said .
" but to make the whole thing a us adventure and to imply that president bush is more of a threat to the world than everyone else was wrong and unproductive , and can not be justified by the current difficulties in iraq .

foreign minister joschka fischer felt the gentle slap of rejection during his recent trip to washington , when us secretary of state condoleezza rice politely told him where berlin could stick its bid .

and as the eu slipped into crisis following the failed referenda in france and the netherlands , he expressed his hope for a strong europe . but beneath the surface of the official courtesy , relations between this us administration and germany 's ruling coalition remain tense .
just one week ago , german defense minister peter struck cancelled a trip to the us because his counterpart in the pentagon , donald rumsfeld , would n't give him enough time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his part , rumsfeld knows that germany wo n't give him the military backup his forces in iraq need .
michael o 'hanlon of the political science research organization , brookings institution said that 's part of the problem . " our military in iraq is on the brink of collapse , " he said .
" france and germany have the capacity to help us if they want to , but we know they wo n't do that .
and president bush wo n't even bother addressing the issue although we could really do with the help . " bad taste lingers washington knows very well that germany is on the brink of a change of government , and members of the white house still clearly remember that schröder went into the last federal elections down on us policy on iraq . " it would have been okay if schröder had simply said , ' the war in iraq is a bad idea , that 's my position and i 'm sticking to it , " ' o 'hanlon said .
" but to make the whole thing a us adventure and to imply that president bush is more of a threat to the world than everyone else was wrong and unproductive , and can not be justified by the current difficulties in iraq . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with rice in washington on june 8 the residue is sticky , and has doubtless contributed to washington 's cool reception to the german bid for a permanent seat in the un security council .
foreign minister joschka fischer felt the gentle slap of rejection during his recent trip to washington , when us secretary of state condoleezza rice politely told him where berlin could stick its bid .
if there is one thing , however , that has emerged unscathed from the rocky spell between berlin and washington , it is economic relations .

during the us-eu summit , us president bush said he wanted the crisis-hit bloc to be a " strong " global partner .

" in my view , we must carry out commitments , even if they are unpopular , " fischer told a meeting of polish diplomats in warsaw , according to reuters .
" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one . " earlier on monday , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the eu should suspend enlargement after letting bulgaria and romania in following the french and dutch voters ' rejection of the eu constitution , in what appeared to be a reference to turkey 's eu entry bid . the polish capital warsaw is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from germany , france britain and poland in an effort to break the deadlock in the aftermath of the failed european union summit earlier this month .
according to polish diplomats , warsaw is keen to play the role of a mediator in the conflict concerning the future of eu reforms and budget . charm offensive at the same time , france and britain this week are launching separate charm offensives among the new eu member states of central and eastern europe to push for their very different visions of the bloc 's future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with fischer french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy and british european affairs minister douglas alexander are both in warsaw bidding to influence the polish position in the budget negotiations of the months ahead . on friday , france 's european affairs minister catherine colonna flies to budapest on the first of a series of visits which a foreign ministry spokesman in paris said are " intended to display our particular attention to the new member states . "
alexander and british deputy prime minister john prescott are also planning several visits to the new members , as their country begins its six-month presidency of the european union . the rival diplomatic initiatives are part of the fall-out of the brussels summit , in which britain lost capital among its traditional allies in central and eastern europe by appearing as the prime culprit for the blockage of the post-2007 budget . if london sees it as an urgent priority to smooth over the difficulties by promising early action on the budget under its presidency , france believes it has an opportunity to recover some of its lost standing in the region . capping cap ? the french ministers are likely to lay stress on the shared interest that france and many of the new members have in sustaining the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which has been under attack as exorbitant and outmoded by british prime minister tony blair .
in his visit to poland monday , douste-blazy will have the backing of his german counterpart fischer who will join tripartite talks with polish foreign minister adam rotfeld . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair speaking to meps at the european parliament in brussels it was at poland 's initiative that the 10 new member states suggested at the brussels summit that their eu allocations be reduced if that would make it easier to reach a budget deal .
the idea - described as " moving " by french president jacques chirac - came to nothing , because blair stuck to his position that britain would only discuss its rebate if chirac also agreed to put the cap on the negotiating table . " it is a good opening for us -lrb- with the new members -rrb- .
discussions with them are going to accelerate , " said a french diplomat .
" these countries are used to language from britain that is very pro-enlargement , but when it came to putting hands in wallets they were n't there .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .

us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .

" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .
statistics from the federal labor office for march 2005 showed 1.75 million people with at least one low-paying side job - and that number is growing .
the estimated number of unreported cases of people working more than one mini-job is extremely high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning new skills in the hope of getting one job that pays a living wage frank herzen from cologne does n't have any children - but he still works an 18-hour day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.06.2005 social democrats call for wealth tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich germans would have to pay 3 percent more in taxes behind in the polls and threatened by a new left-wing party , germany 's ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- will propose a wealth tax as part of its platform for early elections scheduled for this fall . in a turn to the left from its position in the last two elections , spd leader franz müntefering said sunday the party if returned to power will impose a 3 percent additional tax on single people earning more than 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 302,000 -rrb- or married couples earning more than 500,000 euros a year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " the additional money which we 'd gain from the tax hike for the wealthy would be channeled into education , research and innovative technologies , " müntefering told a news conference . he said the party did not intend to call for an increase in the 42 percent rate of income tax imposed on the highest band of earnings , nor would it change the present rates of value added tax , a form of sales tax common throughout the european union . the newsmagazine der spiegel said the social democrats , if re-elected , would increase value-added tax on consumer goods from 16 to 20 percent to slash the budget deficit .
the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .
" and it 's tough when you 're 1-0 up then the other side gets an equalizer , we had to work hard to hold off argentina .
on top of that we were getting tired . " positive signs for world cup 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the winner against brazil .
lavolpe and mexico head home to prepare for the final push towards qualifying for germany next year with the satisfaction of having beaten japan and brazil in the group stages . but the latter stages of their confed cup campaign was overshadowed by the expulsion of two key players - aaron galindo and salvador carmona - on suspicion of having taken the banned steroid nandrolene . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina in final after penalty drama argentina will face brazil in the 2005 confederations cup final on june 29 after beating mexico 6-5 on penalties on sunday .

and as the eu slipped into crisis following the failed referenda in france and the netherlands , he expressed his hope for a strong europe . but beneath the surface of the official courtesy , relations between this us administration and germany 's ruling coalition remain tense .
just one week ago , german defense minister peter struck cancelled a trip to the us because his counterpart in the pentagon , donald rumsfeld , would n't give him enough time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his part , rumsfeld knows that germany wo n't give him the military backup his forces in iraq need .
michael o 'hanlon of the political science research organization , brookings institution said that 's part of the problem . " our military in iraq is on the brink of collapse , " he said .
" france and germany have the capacity to help us if they want to , but we know they wo n't do that .
and president bush wo n't even bother addressing the issue although we could really do with the help . " bad taste lingers washington knows very well that germany is on the brink of a change of government , and members of the white house still clearly remember that schröder went into the last federal elections down on us policy on iraq . " it would have been okay if schröder had simply said , ' the war in iraq is a bad idea , that 's my position and i 'm sticking to it , " ' o 'hanlon said .
" but to make the whole thing a us adventure and to imply that president bush is more of a threat to the world than everyone else was wrong and unproductive , and can not be justified by the current difficulties in iraq . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with rice in washington on june 8 the residue is sticky , and has doubtless contributed to washington 's cool reception to the german bid for a permanent seat in the un security council .
foreign minister joschka fischer felt the gentle slap of rejection during his recent trip to washington , when us secretary of state condoleezza rice politely told him where berlin could stick its bid .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .

" i was very pleased indeed to hear that there was no opposition , vis-a-vis germany as such , from the president , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters after the meeting .
" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .

the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2005 new members shaping debate on eu future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fischer remains committed to eu enlargement german foreign minister joschka fischer said monday european union politicians must continue with further expansion of the bloc even in the face of growing popular opposition to enlargement . " in my view , we must carry out commitments , even if they are unpopular , " fischer told a meeting of polish diplomats in warsaw , according to reuters .
" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one . " earlier on monday , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the eu should suspend enlargement after letting bulgaria and romania in following the french and dutch voters ' rejection of the eu constitution , in what appeared to be a reference to turkey 's eu entry bid . the polish capital warsaw is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from germany , france britain and poland in an effort to break the deadlock in the aftermath of the failed european union summit earlier this month .
according to polish diplomats , warsaw is keen to play the role of a mediator in the conflict concerning the future of eu reforms and budget . charm offensive at the same time , france and britain this week are launching separate charm offensives among the new eu member states of central and eastern europe to push for their very different visions of the bloc 's future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with fischer french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy and british european affairs minister douglas alexander are both in warsaw bidding to influence the polish position in the budget negotiations of the months ahead . on friday , france 's european affairs minister catherine colonna flies to budapest on the first of a series of visits which a foreign ministry spokesman in paris said are " intended to display our particular attention to the new member states .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .

bush and schröder 's meeting on monday highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . reforms to the united nations dominated what us president george w. bush called " frank " talks at the white house between the two leaders , who had been divided over german opposition to the us war in iraq .
" we oppose no country 's bid for the security council , " bush said to the obvious delight of the german leader who faces a re-election test in september .

" we are very much in agreement that this reform is duly and urgently needed .
and it has always been clear that it is first the reform and then the candidacies to potential seats " that must be decided , schröder added .
" if you ask me about whether i see differences , i 'd possibly say there are differences in the timing ; we were pushing to have things happening very quickly , " the chancellor added .
focus on international activity schröder said that he had pleaded germany 's case for a permanent seat to bush by highlighting its contribution to stabilization efforts in afghanistan and the balkans and to reconstruction efforts in iraq .
" since we 're doing all these things internationally , we would very much hope that at some point in time we could also have a right to representation on the security council if there were the space , " he said .

the us administration is also closely watching efforts by germany , britain and france to convince iran against developing nuclear weapons - efforts that will attract even more attention after the election of hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad as iran 's new president .
bush said the united states would maintain its support for the european trio though the message to iran remained blunt .
" my message to the chancellor is that we continue working with great britain , france and germany to send a focused , concerted , unified message that says the development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable and a process which would enable iran to develop a nuclear weapon is unacceptable , " declared the us leader .
asked about the legitimacy of iran 's election , bush went on : " it 's never free and fair when a group of people , unelected people , get to decide who 's on the ballot . "

" in my view , we must carry out commitments , even if they are unpopular , " fischer told a meeting of polish diplomats in warsaw , according to reuters .
" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one . " earlier on monday , french interior minister nicolas sarkozy said the eu should suspend enlargement after letting bulgaria and romania in following the french and dutch voters ' rejection of the eu constitution , in what appeared to be a reference to turkey 's eu entry bid . the polish capital warsaw is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from germany , france britain and poland in an effort to break the deadlock in the aftermath of the failed european union summit earlier this month .
according to polish diplomats , warsaw is keen to play the role of a mediator in the conflict concerning the future of eu reforms and budget . charm offensive at the same time , france and britain this week are launching separate charm offensives among the new eu member states of central and eastern europe to push for their very different visions of the bloc 's future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe douste-blazy with fischer french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy and british european affairs minister douglas alexander are both in warsaw bidding to influence the polish position in the budget negotiations of the months ahead . on friday , france 's european affairs minister catherine colonna flies to budapest on the first of a series of visits which a foreign ministry spokesman in paris said are " intended to display our particular attention to the new member states . "
alexander and british deputy prime minister john prescott are also planning several visits to the new members , as their country begins its six-month presidency of the european union . the rival diplomatic initiatives are part of the fall-out of the brussels summit , in which britain lost capital among its traditional allies in central and eastern europe by appearing as the prime culprit for the blockage of the post-2007 budget . if london sees it as an urgent priority to smooth over the difficulties by promising early action on the budget under its presidency , france believes it has an opportunity to recover some of its lost standing in the region . capping cap ? the french ministers are likely to lay stress on the shared interest that france and many of the new members have in sustaining the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , which has been under attack as exorbitant and outmoded by british prime minister tony blair .

france now has an opportunity to build up relations with them . " however guillaume durand of the european policy center in brussels warned that the current alignment may be only superficial .
the new members have not forgotten chirac 's contemptuous remarks when they offered support to the us over iraq that they had " missed an opportunity to keep quiet .

" the eu must do what it promised to do .
however , if we think we can enlarge without deepening integration and closing ranks , then from this crisis we can tumble into a bigger one .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .
statistics from the federal labor office for march 2005 showed 1.75 million people with at least one low-paying side job - and that number is growing .
the estimated number of unreported cases of people working more than one mini-job is extremely high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning new skills in the hope of getting one job that pays a living wage frank herzen from cologne does n't have any children - but he still works an 18-hour day .
the 33-year-old worked as a chef for many years , but is now concentrating on getting his secondary school diploma .
his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .
herzen had to give up his chef 's job for health reasons , and opted to go back to school in order to open up new opportunities for himself .
twice a week , when school lets out , he goes to work as a supermarket clerk . school , supermarket , bar " in the evenings , i also try to take a couple shifts behind the bar , " herzen said .
" i try not to do those shifts during the week , but sometimes it ca n't be helped .
so sometimes i leave my job at the supermarket and go straight to the bar , where i work until 3 or 4 a.m.
and then i have to get up for school at 8 a.m. " herzen 's supermarket job does n't pay enough to cover his living expenses .
together with the bar job , he 's able to scrape together 1,000 euros a month . but racing from one job to the next is no way to live , says herzen . " when you 're doing three jobs simultaneously , you ca n't really identify with any of the employers , but you also do n't have the time or the peace of mind to work on finding a better solution , " he said . herzen 's goal is to get a fixed contract so that he can concentrate his energies .
" it 's definitely not my plan to spend my whole life as a mini-jobber , " he said . matthias hof -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . -lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- working poor on the rise in germany the number of people in germany holding two or three jobs in order to hold their heads above water has been alarmingly high for years .
now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .
" and it 's tough when you 're 1-0 up then the other side gets an equalizer , we had to work hard to hold off argentina .
on top of that we were getting tired . " positive signs for world cup 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the winner against brazil .
lavolpe and mexico head home to prepare for the final push towards qualifying for germany next year with the satisfaction of having beaten japan and brazil in the group stages . but the latter stages of their confed cup campaign was overshadowed by the expulsion of two key players - aaron galindo and salvador carmona - on suspicion of having taken the banned steroid nandrolene . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina in final after penalty drama argentina will face brazil in the 2005 confederations cup final on june 29 after beating mexico 6-5 on penalties on sunday .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .

" i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team .

" marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .
-lrb- may 17 , 2005 -rrb- a german socialist 's slurpy snogs erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .
" we want workers to know that they 'll not be exposed to free falling , concerning their earnings in future . " confidence vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder on his return from washington this week , schröder was to inform the ruling coalition of his plans for a confidence vote friday in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament .
the vote is intended to clear the way for elections a year ahead of schedule . schröder called for new elections in may after the social democrats lost heavily in a regional election in their former stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , as core spd voters were put off by the government 's economic reforms . according to the latest polls , the social democrats are likely to get between 26 and 29 percent in a general election , compared to 45 and 49 percent for the conservative christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2005 opinion : a -lrb- not so -rrb- fond farewell ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's washington summit with george bush could be his last summits are often nothing more than happy handshakes and empty photo ops , but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to the white house monday is likely to be a particularly egregious waste of jet fuel . if us president george bush has his druthers , this will be the last time he has to host gerhard schröder in washington dc .
with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .
schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .
-lrb- june 27 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .
schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .
-lrb- june 27 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .
statistics from the federal labor office for march 2005 showed 1.75 million people with at least one low-paying side job - and that number is growing .
the estimated number of unreported cases of people working more than one mini-job is extremely high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning new skills in the hope of getting one job that pays a living wage frank herzen from cologne does n't have any children - but he still works an 18-hour day .
the 33-year-old worked as a chef for many years , but is now concentrating on getting his secondary school diploma .
his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .
herzen had to give up his chef 's job for health reasons , and opted to go back to school in order to open up new opportunities for himself .
twice a week , when school lets out , he goes to work as a supermarket clerk . school , supermarket , bar " in the evenings , i also try to take a couple shifts behind the bar , " herzen said .
" i try not to do those shifts during the week , but sometimes it ca n't be helped .
so sometimes i leave my job at the supermarket and go straight to the bar , where i work until 3 or 4 a.m.
and then i have to get up for school at 8 a.m. " herzen 's supermarket job does n't pay enough to cover his living expenses .
together with the bar job , he 's able to scrape together 1,000 euros a month . but racing from one job to the next is no way to live , says herzen . " when you 're doing three jobs simultaneously , you ca n't really identify with any of the employers , but you also do n't have the time or the peace of mind to work on finding a better solution , " he said . herzen 's goal is to get a fixed contract so that he can concentrate his energies .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .
foreign firms , particularly german ones , hope this territory is home to other " planetary pearls .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .

" i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .

" that was n't one of our best matches , " pekerman conceded after esteban cambiasso knocked in his spot-kick to hand argentina a 6-5 penalty win after the sides were deadlocked 1-1 after extra time .
" but my team has the capacity to produce a good performance against brazil . " shorter preparation time no disadvantage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have the luxury of an extra day 's recovery time having seen off germany in the other semi-final on saturday , but pekerman dismissed the notion that fatigue could count against argentina . " okay we 've got one day less before the final but my team are young and ambitious and i 'm sure we 'll be ready for brazil in two days time , " he said . as well as the lack of recovery time , the grey-haired former argentine youth coach will also have to make do without striker javier saviola after the monaco star was sent off after an ill-judged tackle on gonzalo pineda in the 90th minute . young and established stars producing the goods pekerman has used the confed cup to hand valuable international experience to players like goalkeeper german lux , who set up argentina 's win when he saved mexico 's sixth penalty taken by ricardo osorio . " saving that penalty represents an important stage in his career , " pekerman said . bildunterschrift : argentina 's goalkeeper german lux saves from mexico 's ricardo osorio in the penalty shootout argentine defender ricardo zanetti , who was making his 100th international appearance , added : " as expected it was a hard game but at the end we deserved to win . " team spirit carries argentina on pekerman believes that despite his team 's shortcomings there were plenty of positives to take from the game . " it was n't a great performance - there 's always a sense of drama in a game that will take you to the final , " he said .
" but we showed our fighting spirit , especially in the second half , and we kept our faith when we went a goal down .
the players came up with the answers in the end . " " we showed a lot of heart , " argentine captain juan pablo sorin added .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .
" we want workers to know that they 'll not be exposed to free falling , concerning their earnings in future . " confidence vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder on his return from washington this week , schröder was to inform the ruling coalition of his plans for a confidence vote friday in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament .
the vote is intended to clear the way for elections a year ahead of schedule . schröder called for new elections in may after the social democrats lost heavily in a regional election in their former stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , as core spd voters were put off by the government 's economic reforms . according to the latest polls , the social democrats are likely to get between 26 and 29 percent in a general election , compared to 45 and 49 percent for the conservative christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .
" we want workers to know that they 'll not be exposed to free falling , concerning their earnings in future . " confidence vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder on his return from washington this week , schröder was to inform the ruling coalition of his plans for a confidence vote friday in the bundestag , the lower house of parliament .
the vote is intended to clear the way for elections a year ahead of schedule . schröder called for new elections in may after the social democrats lost heavily in a regional election in their former stronghold of north rhine-westphalia , as core spd voters were put off by the government 's economic reforms . according to the latest polls , the social democrats are likely to get between 26 and 29 percent in a general election , compared to 45 and 49 percent for the conservative christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

and as the eu slipped into crisis following the failed referenda in france and the netherlands , he expressed his hope for a strong europe . but beneath the surface of the official courtesy , relations between this us administration and germany 's ruling coalition remain tense .

" france and germany have the capacity to help us if they want to , but we know they wo n't do that .
and president bush wo n't even bother addressing the issue although we could really do with the help . " bad taste lingers washington knows very well that germany is on the brink of a change of government , and members of the white house still clearly remember that schröder went into the last federal elections down on us policy on iraq . " it would have been okay if schröder had simply said , ' the war in iraq is a bad idea , that 's my position and i 'm sticking to it , " ' o 'hanlon said .
" but to make the whole thing a us adventure and to imply that president bush is more of a threat to the world than everyone else was wrong and unproductive , and can not be justified by the current difficulties in iraq .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .

to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .

his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .

and as the eu slipped into crisis following the failed referenda in france and the netherlands , he expressed his hope for a strong europe . but beneath the surface of the official courtesy , relations between this us administration and germany 's ruling coalition remain tense .
just one week ago , german defense minister peter struck cancelled a trip to the us because his counterpart in the pentagon , donald rumsfeld , would n't give him enough time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for his part , rumsfeld knows that germany wo n't give him the military backup his forces in iraq need .
michael o 'hanlon of the political science research organization , brookings institution said that 's part of the problem . " our military in iraq is on the brink of collapse , " he said .
" france and germany have the capacity to help us if they want to , but we know they wo n't do that .
and president bush wo n't even bother addressing the issue although we could really do with the help . " bad taste lingers washington knows very well that germany is on the brink of a change of government , and members of the white house still clearly remember that schröder went into the last federal elections down on us policy on iraq . " it would have been okay if schröder had simply said , ' the war in iraq is a bad idea , that 's my position and i 'm sticking to it , " ' o 'hanlon said .
" but to make the whole thing a us adventure and to imply that president bush is more of a threat to the world than everyone else was wrong and unproductive , and can not be justified by the current difficulties in iraq . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with rice in washington on june 8 the residue is sticky , and has doubtless contributed to washington 's cool reception to the german bid for a permanent seat in the un security council .
foreign minister joschka fischer felt the gentle slap of rejection during his recent trip to washington , when us secretary of state condoleezza rice politely told him where berlin could stick its bid .

adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .
statistics from the federal labor office for march 2005 showed 1.75 million people with at least one low-paying side job - and that number is growing .
the estimated number of unreported cases of people working more than one mini-job is extremely high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning new skills in the hope of getting one job that pays a living wage frank herzen from cologne does n't have any children - but he still works an 18-hour day .
the 33-year-old worked as a chef for many years , but is now concentrating on getting his secondary school diploma .
his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .
herzen had to give up his chef 's job for health reasons , and opted to go back to school in order to open up new opportunities for himself .
twice a week , when school lets out , he goes to work as a supermarket clerk . school , supermarket , bar " in the evenings , i also try to take a couple shifts behind the bar , " herzen said .
" i try not to do those shifts during the week , but sometimes it ca n't be helped .
so sometimes i leave my job at the supermarket and go straight to the bar , where i work until 3 or 4 a.m.
and then i have to get up for school at 8 a.m. " herzen 's supermarket job does n't pay enough to cover his living expenses .
together with the bar job , he 's able to scrape together 1,000 euros a month . but racing from one job to the next is no way to live , says herzen . " when you 're doing three jobs simultaneously , you ca n't really identify with any of the employers , but you also do n't have the time or the peace of mind to work on finding a better solution , " he said . herzen 's goal is to get a fixed contract so that he can concentrate his energies .
" it 's definitely not my plan to spend my whole life as a mini-jobber , " he said . matthias hof -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . -lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- working poor on the rise in germany the number of people in germany holding two or three jobs in order to hold their heads above water has been alarmingly high for years .

erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days . the 61-meter -lrb- 200-foot -rrb- ship was bought by a dubai businessman for somewhere between 700,000 and 1 million euros -lrb- $ 850,000 - $ 1.2 million -rrb- , germany 's bild am sonntag weekly reported .
hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .
-lrb- may 17 , 2005 -rrb- a german socialist 's slurpy snogs erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .
-lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- honecker 's ashes might return to germany a decade after former east german leader erich honecker died of liver cancer in chilean exile on may 29 , 1994 , his ashes could return to germany to be buried in his hometown near the german-french border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.06.2005 opinion : a -lrb- not so -rrb- fond farewell ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's washington summit with george bush could be his last summits are often nothing more than happy handshakes and empty photo ops , but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's visit to the white house monday is likely to be a particularly egregious waste of jet fuel . if us president george bush has his druthers , this will be the last time he has to host gerhard schröder in washington dc .
with an early election looming in germany this fall , many in the american capital have written the chancellor off as a lame duck during his one-day transatlantic trip . it 's no secret that schröder and bush have never been on especially good terms .
bush 's often strident unilateralism and blithe dismissals of issues like global warming never went down well in germany and after staunchly opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq , schröder was long considered a persona non grata for the texan . after a few rocky years , icy relations between washington and berlin have thawed .
however , ties between the two leaders could n't exactly be described as chummy .
they work together because they have to , as key nato allies and as representatives of two of the world 's largest economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still , these two guys could n't be more different and looking at their backgrounds you would n't really expect them to be pals : schröder is the secular social democrat from humble beginnings and bush is a born-again christian conservative with a patrician background . with schröder unpopular in his own party and way behind germany 's conservative opposition in opinion polls , his re-election at this point is highly unlikely .
and that 's a cause for celebration in many quarters of washington .
you can almost see members of bush 's team rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of schröder being booted from office in less than three months . unloved in dc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of unidentified protestors hold a sign reading in german and english welcome -lrb- german chancellor gerhard -rrb- schroeder , not war , during a demonstration in arrecife on lanzarote island tuesday feb .
11 , 2003 where spain and germany are to hold a summit .
since schröder banked his last election campaign in 2002 on directly opposing bush 's foreign policy , few administration officials would weep at his departure this september .
us neoconservatives , already brimming with contempt for the german leader , now see even less reason to support berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council . accordingly , the chancellor is likely to get the no-frills treatment during monday 's summit .
bush , happy to wait and see if conservative christian democrat leader angela merkel takes over in berlin , certainly has no reason to offer schröder anything of substance .
a handshake , a photo op and the chancellor can expect nothing more for his trouble . and schröder probably knows it .
with the early election to be set in motion by a confidence vote in parliament this friday , he undoubtedly realizes his time would be better spent on his rather more pressing domestic problems .
despite the largely pointless exercise of the us summit , he could n't call it off entirely , instead choosing to lop off an extra few days to san francisco . however , foregoing a last visit with his " good friend george " might have been the smarter move .
as it stands now , coming home empty handed from the atlantic outing is only likely to underline the impression with german voters that schröder is on his way out . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's dossier on the upcoming election in germany .
schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .
-lrb- june 27 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian players kaka , left , and ronaldinho , right , jubilate after kaka scored the second goal for brazil the world champions played jose pekermann's side off the park and goals by kaka , ronaldinho , and two by adriano put the issue beyond doubt .
adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .
mexico though replied swiftly and fonseca equalised.the build up to their second goal through schweinsteiger was probably germanys best goal in the klinsmann era and involved some delicate passing .
mexico to their credit fought back and equalised just after half-time through borghetti .
germany suddenly found themselves down to 10 men after maik hanke was sent off for a harsh foul .
robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .
surely this would be the winning goal ... however , there was more to come . mexico won a free-kick on the edge of the german box and up rises borghetti to score his second goal ... 3-3 the score ... kahn beaten for the third time.the match goes into extra time and with both sides going all out to win ... it was michael ballack who got germanys winner from a beautifully executed free-kick .
so , what have germany learned from this competition ?
after conceding 11 goals in these five matches they know that they have to do something about their defence .
jürgen klinsmann though has brought the smiles back to german football .
his new methods , among them american fitness coaches seem to be having a positive effect on the squad indeed , the players look happy ... the fans are happy .
and although third place may not be what the supporters had been hoping for klinnsman's side has shown that they are ready to challenge the giants of world football next year . alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto .

the decision to impose the wealth tax was taken at a meeting of the party leadership , which is in the process of drawing up a campaign manifesto . whichever party wins the election will have to reign in germany 's budget deficit , which has exceeded the three percent of gdp ceiling imposed on all countries within the 12-nation european single currency zone . spd support crumbing confronted with mounting criticism that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government has let the more affluent off the hook while implementing painful social and economic reforms , spd leaders hope a turn to the left can stabilize the party 's crumbling support . opposition leaders are calling the spd 's wealth tax drive populist , as it only represents a helpless effort to keep potential voters from backing a new leftist alliance which according to latest surveys already stands to garner some 9 percent of the likely vote in september . according to kurt beck , premier of the german state of rhineland-palatinate , the spd leadership also agreed to raise the welfare and unemployment benefits for people in eastern germany to the same level of that in the west of the country .
the difference is only a slight one due to regional differences in the cost of living , but the measure would be popular with eastern voters . the social democrats could also likely make the fight for a minimum wage a central theme in its election manifesto . " we need a minimum wage solution which will ensure that people will be able to actually live on what they take home , " müntefering said .
" we want workers to know that they 'll not be exposed to free falling , concerning their earnings in future .

in particular he questioned the italian 's decision not to red card argentina 's fabricio coloccini after a horror tackle on ramon morales in the 70th minute .
morales had to be stretchered off in agony and following the incident boos rang round the stadium every time coloccini touched the ball . " at this level of competition above football there is finance and the thinking that the final must be disputed by certain teams , " lavolpe said .
" colocchini should have been sent off for a terrible foul , that 's beyond dispute , because he was obviously playing the man . " soccer superpowers more equal than others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's esteban cambiasso celebrates his winning penalty kick .
" the superpowers are always at an advantage in this sort of situation , whilst the sport would like everyone to be treated equally , " added the argentina-born coach after seeing mexico 's 22-match unbeaten run was stopped by the south americans . argentina coach jose pekerman was understandably taking an opposing view of rossetti 's performance . " i do n't want to go into this but as far as i 'm concerned the referee performed to the rules and i trust the decisions he took on the pitch , " he told the post-match press conference . lavolpe 's frustration was tempered by what he saw as a positive display by his concacaf champions with carlos salcido handing them the lead in the 14th minute of extra time only for luciano figueroa to level , with argentina going on to win 6-5 on penalties . " we showed good ball control , " lavolpe said .
" the difference was in the individual argentine players , as we were better as a team . " marquez loss cost mexico dearly , says lavolpe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael marquez in the dying moments of normal time both teams were reduced to ten men with first argentina striker javier saviola red carded for an injudicious tackle on gonzalo pineda , followed by influential defender rafael marquez ' expulsion for a second yellow card . " marquez 's sending off hurt us badly , with him off the pitch our defense found it hard to withstand argentina , " lavolpe said .
" and it 's tough when you 're 1-0 up then the other side gets an equalizer , we had to work hard to hold off argentina .
on top of that we were getting tired . " positive signs for world cup 2006 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti celebrates after scoring the winner against brazil .
lavolpe and mexico head home to prepare for the final push towards qualifying for germany next year with the satisfaction of having beaten japan and brazil in the group stages . but the latter stages of their confed cup campaign was overshadowed by the expulsion of two key players - aaron galindo and salvador carmona - on suspicion of having taken the banned steroid nandrolene . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina in final after penalty drama argentina will face brazil in the 2005 confederations cup final on june 29 after beating mexico 6-5 on penalties on sunday .

hamburg yacht broker jan bültmann said the buyer " was n't the least bit interested " in the boat 's colored past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker dubbed by honecker " ostseeland , " or baltic sea country , the boat hosted prominent guests like cuban leader fidel castro during its tour of duty as east germany 's state yacht .
originally fitted to clear mines , it was rebuilt for the communist boss in 1971 .
but since he was prone to seasickness , honecker seldom went on outings with his luxurious ship . the yacht already changed hands once since the demise of the gdr , shedding its name on the way .
now " aniara , " as it 's been dubbed , is currently anchored in istanbul awaiting a fresh overhaul for its new owner .
there was no word as to whether the surveillance system installed in each of the ship 's 16 cabins has been retained , nor whether the new owner has sturdier sea legs than his east german predecessor . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ' honecker 's yacht ' for sale a luxury yacht used by the former east german leader erich honecker and which played host to fidel castro is for sale for 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 632,000 -rrb- on a german internet site .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .

thirty years ago , the world 's biggest gas field was discovered here .
called the " pearl of the planet " in soviet propaganda , a whole town has sprung up around it . in winter , the temperature can drop to -60 degrees celsius -lrb- -140 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- and for five months , inhabitants never see the sun . it is here , however , at novi urengoi , a four-hour flight from moscow , that 15 engineers from wintershall , a subsidiary of germany 's chemical giant , basf , have been living since recently . extreme conditions other colleagues should soon be joining them , ready to face the snow storms in winter and the hordes of mosquitoes which invade the town in summer when temperatures occasionally rise to 40 degrees celsius . the german teams work in three-week shifts , immersed in a different world .
here , the flag of the world 's first gas producer , gazprom , flutters over the town hall ; the children attend gazprom nurseries and later when they are old enough , gazprom schools . here too , every morning , their parents leave their apartment blocks , painted pink and light blue , and take the dead straight road to the north , to the gasfields . despite the harsh living conditions , foreign gas firms are falling over themselves to come here . russia boasts nearly a quarter of the world 's gas reserves and getting the gas to market is easier than from countries such as iran , algeria or qatar because the pipes can be laid over land . germany is particularly interested because 35 percent of its gas comes from russia . fierce competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and russian president vladimir putin exchange contracts after their opening tour at the world 's largest industrial fair in hanover , northern germany , on monday , april 11 , 2005 .
germany 's basf ag and russia 's natural gas company gazprom have signed a deal to expand joint oil and gas exploration , a sign of growing economic links highlighted at a meeting of the two countries ' leaders .
in april in the northern german city of hanover , with a great deal of pomp , basf and gazprom signed an agreement in the presence of german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin to develop the key yuzhno-russkoye gas field . " the whole of germany is delighted by this cooperation , " declared the chancellor , speaking about the historic deal .
all perhaps except another german firm , eon ruhrgas , which had already signed a precontract when it was pipped to the post because gazprom preferred the basf subsidiary . no " german-russian " gas will flow for several years .
the german engineers at novi urengoi , who are experts in prospecting in very difficult conditions , are only cooperating with the russians in a small joint venture . however , " a success would facilitate other projects , " says frank tauchnitz , one of the german directors of the project . the potential for many more projects is huge .
behind novi urengoi , there is a lot more of siberia waiting to be explored .
foreign firms , particularly german ones , hope this territory is home to other " planetary pearls .

but a growing number of germans are now among the nation 's new working poor . iris otten from the town of mönchengladbach wakes each morning at 6 a.m. to face an 18-hour day .
the 48-year-old has been a single mother for nine years .
her first task is to make sure her daughter and two sons - aged 15 , 16 and 19 - eat breakfast and get off to school .
then she makes the beds and does a bit of housework until 9 a.m. , when her first customer arrives . otten gives pedicures in a converted room in her basement , earning around 150 euros -lrb- $ 180 -rrb- in addition to what she gets from the state in the form of unemployment benefit and family allowance .
it 's never enough .
though otten is able to cover her fixed costs , there are always additional expenses - gas , clothing , school supplies for her kids . for that reason , otten completed a three-year course to become a non-medical practitioner .
she set up a small practice in the same room where she gives pedicures .
her relatives gave her an interest-free loan to get the business started , but visits from clients are still erratic .
her goal ?
to earn a living , independent from state support . working longer to scrape by in march , almost 6.6 million people in germany were working so-called " mini-jobs " for minimal wages .
since the money is often not enough to get by , many of these people hold several jobs .
statistics from the federal labor office for march 2005 showed 1.75 million people with at least one low-paying side job - and that number is growing .
the estimated number of unreported cases of people working more than one mini-job is extremely high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning new skills in the hope of getting one job that pays a living wage frank herzen from cologne does n't have any children - but he still works an 18-hour day .
the 33-year-old worked as a chef for many years , but is now concentrating on getting his secondary school diploma .
his lessons begin at 8 a.m.
today , he has to give a presentation in biology , which he prepared in between completing assignments for other courses and working the two jobs he needs to finance his studies .
herzen had to give up his chef 's job for health reasons , and opted to go back to school in order to open up new opportunities for himself .
twice a week , when school lets out , he goes to work as a supermarket clerk . school , supermarket , bar " in the evenings , i also try to take a couple shifts behind the bar , " herzen said .
" i try not to do those shifts during the week , but sometimes it ca n't be helped .
so sometimes i leave my job at the supermarket and go straight to the bar , where i work until 3 or 4 a.m.
and then i have to get up for school at 8 a.m. " herzen 's supermarket job does n't pay enough to cover his living expenses .
together with the bar job , he 's able to scrape together 1,000 euros a month . but racing from one job to the next is no way to live , says herzen . " when you 're doing three jobs simultaneously , you ca n't really identify with any of the employers , but you also do n't have the time or the peace of mind to work on finding a better solution , " he said . herzen 's goal is to get a fixed contract so that he can concentrate his energies .
" it 's definitely not my plan to spend my whole life as a mini-jobber , " he said . matthias hof -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slaves to globalization against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . -lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- working poor on the rise in germany the number of people in germany holding two or three jobs in order to hold their heads above water has been alarmingly high for years .

adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian players kaka , left , and ronaldinho , right , jubilate after kaka scored the second goal for brazil the world champions played jose pekermann's side off the park and goals by kaka , ronaldinho , and two by adriano put the issue beyond doubt .
adriano's double made him the competition's top scorer with 5 goals .
argentina's only reply came when aimar scored with a torpedo header .
this was brazil's second confederations cup title and the wet conditions in frankfurt did nothing to dampen brazil's mood as they send out a warning ahead of their world cup defence in germany next year .
the german team finished the tournament on a high note as they took third place after beating mexico 4-3 in leipzig.this turned out to be arguably the best match in the competition .
lukas podolski , germanys exciting new striker put the hosts ahead with a superb left foot shot after sebastian schweinsteiger played a clever back heel to him .
mexico though replied swiftly and fonseca equalised.the build up to their second goal through schweinsteiger was probably germanys best goal in the klinsmann era and involved some delicate passing .
mexico to their credit fought back and equalised just after half-time through borghetti .

robert huth , germany's giant defender has had his fair share of criticism during the tournament but a fairy-tale ending looked on the cards for huth when he hammered in germany's third goal .
surely this would be the winning goal ... however , there was more to come . mexico won a free-kick on the edge of the german box and up rises borghetti to score his second goal ... 3-3 the score ... kahn beaten for the third time.the match goes into extra time and with both sides going all out to win ... it was michael ballack who got germanys winner from a beautifully executed free-kick .
so , what have germany learned from this competition ?
after conceding 11 goals in these five matches they know that they have to do something about their defence .
jürgen klinsmann though has brought the smiles back to german football .
his new methods , among them american fitness coaches seem to be having a positive effect on the squad indeed , the players look happy ... the fans are happy .
and although third place may not be what the supporters had been hoping for klinnsman's side has shown that they are ready to challenge the giants of world football next year . alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live politik direkt - das politikmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

lord elis-thomas welcomed proposals to give the assembly more of a law-making role , but raised several concerns .
the plaid cymru am attacked plans for a new committee to create standing orders as " an insult to all of us as ams " .
he forecast fellow peers would oppose a ban on candidates standing in both constituencies and on regional lists .
lord elis-thomas , a former plaid president , has held the equivalent of the house of commons speaker role since the assembly was founded six years ago .
in a speech at the university of wales , aberystwyth , at monday lunchtime , he gave his views on a white paper outlined two weeks ago by welsh secretary peter hain . "
if ordinary clubs and societies are allowed to write their own rules , then surely the national assembly should take full responsibility for its own standing orders ? "
lord elis-thomas during his address , he said a " proper parliamentary body " would represent a major challenge to members and officials .
he added that " long before 2007 " the public would see a substantial change in the way the assembly operated .
the bill would give the assembly more powers to shape laws for wales in areas like health and education , and streamline the role of westminster .
but it falls short of other parties ' demands to give ams in cardiff bay full law-making powers .
however , lord elis-thomas said labour " now believes , as set out in the white paper , that the national assembly should be established as a proper parliamentary body " .
' talking shop ' he said when ams moved into their new debating chamber this autumn they would be " acting like a parliament " .
he also predicted a more effective committee system with the possible abolition of regional committees , which were currently a " talking shop " .
but while he said that he welcomed the white paper , he also raised " three areas of concern " .
" firstly , the suggestion of creating an advisory committee answerable to the secretary of state to draft standing orders is an insult to all of us as assembly members , " he said .
" if ordinary clubs and societies are allowed to write their own rules , then surely the national assembly should take full responsibility for its own standing orders ?
" i also oppose the proposal to bar candidates from standing both in constituencies and on regional lists .
" this seems to me to be unnecessary and undemocratic , and quite possibly an infringement of candidates ' human rights , and i am sure the house of lords will take a cool view of this proposal . "
he is also critical of the term welsh assembly government to describe first minister rhodri morgan and his ministers .
lord elis-thomas argues that calling it the " government of wales " as set out in the original act setting up the assembly , would " provide greater democratic clarity . "
but he added : " even with these weaknesses , i believe the white paper represents a major step forward in the creation of a proper parliament for wales . "
he predicted that the assembly would be able to go further than england and bring in a total ban on smoking in public places as a result .
mr morgan has said the proposals would help the assembly " deliver yet more effectively for the people of wales " and show " devolution keeping pace with what is needed to do the job effectively " .

lord elis-thomas welcomed proposals to give the assembly more of a law-making role , but raised several concerns .
the plaid cymru am attacked plans for a new committee to create standing orders as " an insult to all of us as ams " .
he forecast fellow peers would oppose a ban on candidates standing in both constituencies and on regional lists .
lord elis-thomas , a former plaid president , has held the equivalent of the house of commons speaker role since the assembly was founded six years ago .
in a speech at the university of wales , aberystwyth , at monday lunchtime , he gave his views on a white paper outlined two weeks ago by welsh secretary peter hain .
if ordinary clubs and societies are allowed to write their own rules , then surely the national assembly should take full responsibility for its own standing orders ?
lord elis-thomas during his address , he said a " proper parliamentary body " would represent a major challenge to members and officials .
he added that " long before 2007 " the public would see a substantial change in the way the assembly operated .
the bill would give the assembly more powers to shape laws for wales in areas like health and education , and streamline the role of westminster .
but it falls short of other parties ' demands to give ams in cardiff bay full law-making powers .
however , lord elis-thomas said labour " now believes , as set out in the white paper , that the national assembly should be established as a proper parliamentary body " .
' talking shop ' he said when ams moved into their new debating chamber this autumn they would be " acting like a parliament " .
he also predicted a more effective committee system with the possible abolition of regional committees , which were currently a " talking shop " .
but while he said that he welcomed the white paper , he also raised " three areas of concern " .
rhodri morgan said more law-making could be undertaken by the assembly " firstly , the suggestion of creating an advisory committee answerable to the secretary of state to draft standing orders is an insult to all of us as assembly members , " he said .
" if ordinary clubs and societies are allowed to write their own rules , then surely the national assembly should take full responsibility for its own standing orders ?
" i also oppose the proposal to bar candidates from standing both in constituencies and on regional lists .
" this seems to me to be unnecessary and undemocratic , and quite possibly an infringement of candidates ' human rights , and i am sure the house of lords will take a cool view of this proposal . "
he is also critical of the term welsh assembly government to describe first minister rhodri morgan and his ministers .
lord elis-thomas argues that calling it the " government of wales " as set out in the original act setting up the assembly , would " provide greater democratic clarity . "
but he added : " even with these weaknesses , i believe the white paper represents a major step forward in the creation of a proper parliament for wales . "
he predicted that the assembly would be able to go further than england and bring in a total ban on smoking in public places as a result .
mr morgan has said the proposals would help the assembly " deliver yet more effectively for the people of wales " and show " devolution keeping pace with what is needed to do the job effectively " .

the site , which dates from the first century ad , was first found at dinefwr park , near llandeilo , in 2003 .
experts said the south wales discovery could rewrite our understanding of the roman conquest in the area .
recent surveys confirmed the site , which is invisible from the surface , is much larger than first thought and is made up of two overlapping forts .
emma plunkett dillon , archaeologist for the national trust in wales , said their teams would be digging nine trenches across the site .
" it is lifting the lid off selected areas of part of the site , to determine the character of what is buried beneath the soil because there is nothing to see on the surface , " she said .
excavation will provide the critical dating evidence from items such as coins and pottery gwilym hughes , cambria archaeology " we are all very excited about what we have discovered , and we look forward to taking the investigation a bit further .
" in work in 2003 , we discovered a small fort , with sides about 100m in length - and we found just a small section - a tantalising hint - of a much bigger structure which appeared to be beneath this smallish fort . "
ms plunkett dillon said they think the larger fort , which underlies the smaller one , is around 3.9 hectares in size .
she said that , as well as the forts , the site also contained a civilian settlement , two roads , a possible bath house and " other enigmatic structures which we have yet to explain " .
' unique opportunity ' she added that the site could mean that the roman conquest could be " a much more complicated story than has hitherto been understood " .
" the discovery of this much larger structure really makes us all very excited , and makes us think we have discovered a different chapter , or a different interpretation into the invasion of south west wales , " she said .
gwilym hughes of cambria archaeology , which is undertaking the archaeological work in partnership with the national trust , said the excavation was " a unique opportunity " .
" excavation will provide the critical dating evidence from items such as coins and pottery that may confirm when the forts were built and abandoned , " he said .
there will be two open days at the site on 9 july and 16 july .

the king 's fund report said the problem was set to worsen over the next 20 years unless urgent action was taken .
its year-long investigation found poor access to care and support and wrangles over who should pay - and warns problems are not confined to london .
the department of health said it was currently drawing up proposals for reform of adult social care .
if we got it right more older people could lead independent lives and exercise the choice and control we all desire niall dickson , king 's fund the report also identifies problems with untrained staff being put in charge of elderly people 's care , and a lack of choice about what kind of services they receive .
the elderly are often in a vulnerable position , and are unsure about what is available , so do not challenge what they are offered , the report added .
people ' missing out ' the king 's fund said the complexities of the care system were at the root of the problems they identified .
its report made 30 recommendations for action to improve care services immediately , and in the future .
julia unwin , who chaired the inquiry , said : " care and support services for older people in london are in a sorry state .
" many older people simply are n't getting what they need and steps to improve the situation are being hampered on several fronts .
" at the root of this is a poorly developed care market that is failing older people and their carers . "
she added : " the government is increasingly looking to empower older people through the use of direct payments and individual budgets , but this will not be successful unless there are sufficient services of the right kind that people want to buy . "
ms unwin said the government must urgently review its decision not to increase funding for adult social care and older people in the short term .
she added : " with services for older people currently high on the political agenda , the time is now right to take concerted action . "
green paper king 's fund chief executive niall dickson said : " this substantial inquiry has relevance nationally - many of these findings are not peculiar to london .
" this is a story of a market that is failing and needs to be improved in many ways .
" it is the story of a neglected area of our national life with muddled policy and what looks like inadequate resources .
" if we got it right more older people could lead independent lives and exercise the choice and control we all desire . "
the kings fund has commissioned sir derek wanless to carry out a review of social care needs for the elderly to evaluate the likely costs over the next twenty years .
a department of health spokesperson said : " this report is a valuable contribution to the debate about future models of care for older people .
it is particularly helpful , as it is time to begin a new debate about what it will take to deliver dignity for life .
" we are currently considering the responses from the consultation on the green paper on adult social care and will shortly be deciding on the shape of the follow up to the green paper .
" we will look at the concerns raised in this report as part of that process , alongside a host of other decisions over the months to come . "
shadow health minister simon burns said : " this report is a damning indictment of the problems with long term care in london , which are also reflected elsewhere in the country . "
sandra gidley , liberal democrat spokeswoman for older people , said : " a measure of a civilised society is how it treats its older people .
this report demonstrates that our society is failing . "

the presentation will take place at the national museum of scotland , following a civic reception and a public debate on international writing awards .
kadare said he felt " deeply honoured " to receive the biennial £ 60,000 prize .
other contenders for the award included gabriel garcia marquez , margaret atwood and britain 's ian mcewan .
the presentation of the award will follow a day of events in the scottish capital , unesco 's first city of literature .
asylum kadare was banned by the former communist authorities in albania , and his french publishers had to smuggle his books out of the country .
he was granted political asylum in france in 1990 and has lived there ever since .
" dictatorship and authentic literature are incompatible , " he once said .
kadare 's novels and poems have been translated in more than 40 countries .
his debut work , the general of the dead army , written in 1963 , remains his best-known novel .
professor john carey , chairman of the judges , described kadare as " a universal writer in a tradition of storytelling that goes back to homer " .
the international booker is awarded every two years to a living author writing in english , or translated into the english language .

the study by the national charity sense was the largest ever asking the views of deafblind people .
almost half of those surveyed who use assistive technology were experiencing difficulty .
the devices causing most concern were everyday items like remote controls , cookers , mobile phones and washing machines .
size matters sense commissioned the survey among deafblind people and their families to mark the start of deafblind awareness week and to celebrate its 50th anniversary .
although many of the uk 's 23,000 deafblind people rely on technology for communication , access to information and achieving independence , the survey reveals a high level of dissatisfaction .
among the most commonly cited problems , respondents mentioned : a lack of help when buying items information not being available in alternative formats such as audio , large print or braille the trend for mobile phones to get smaller the print size in instruction manuals being too small " the respondents form a unique group , " say the report 's authors , lucy drescher and nick southern .
" as they have both sight and hearing impairments , technology that works well for them will also work well for millions of people with either hearing or sight impairments . "
the report finds a complete range of views .
one person said that they would be " completely lost " without technology .
cookers can be dangerous especially if controls are confusing but another woman , who relies on a ventilator to breathe , accidentally turned off her own air supply when she pressed the button that she thought would summon assistance .
by the time her carer came to check on her , she was unconscious .
sense says that had the controls been made more accessible she could have avoided a potentially life-threatening situation .
another potentially fatal incident arose from a lack of consistency in the controls on a gas cooker .
a man who had just bought a new cooker was unaware that the knobs for the two back rings turned clockwise to increase the heat , while the two front rings operated in the reverse direction .
he put some oil in a frying pan on what he thought was a low setting and , while chopping an onion , the pan caught fire because he had in fact turned up the ring to the highest setting .
helpful advice sense says that if products were designed inclusively manufacturers could open up new markets because the technology that works well for people with sight and hearing loss can also be of benefit to anyone with either a sight or a hearing impairment .
as the population ages this is a group that will increase in size .
it says companies can improve their designs by : getting advice from deafblind people at the design stage using tactile devices like large raised buttons on phones and keyboards using large text of colour that contrasts well with the background on buttons and keys fitting large screens to devices like mobile phones and allowing the user to customise the text size ensuring consistency so that similar types of controls are operated in the same way making sure that instruction manuals are written in plain english with large illustrations and in a variety of formats the charity is also urging the government to take a lead , and to intervene when specialised equipment has a very small market .
and it wants the government to work at european level to ensure that deafblind people are able to buy accessible manufactured goods .

the study by the national charity sense was the largest ever asking the views of deafblind people .
almost half of those surveyed who use assistive technology were experiencing difficulty .
the devices causing most concern were everyday items like remote controls , cookers , mobile phones and washing machines .
size matters sense commissioned the survey among deafblind people and their families to mark the start of deafblind awareness week and to celebrate its 50th anniversary .
although many of the uk 's 23,000 deafblind people rely on technology for communication , access to information and achieving independence , the survey reveals a high level of dissatisfaction .
among the most commonly cited problems , respondents mentioned : a lack of help when buying items information not being available in alternative formats such as audio , large print or braille the trend for mobile phones to get smaller the print size in instruction manuals being too small " the respondents form a unique group , " say the report 's authors , lucy drescher and nick southern .
" as they have both sight and hearing impairments , technology that works well for them will also work well for millions of people with either hearing or sight impairments . "
the report finds a complete range of views .
one person said that they would be " completely lost " without technology .
but another woman , who relies on a ventilator to breathe , accidentally turned off her own air supply when she pressed the button that she thought would summon assistance .
by the time her carer came to check on her , she was unconscious .
sense says that had the controls been made more accessible she could have avoided a potentially life-threatening situation .
another potentially fatal incident arose from a lack of consistency in the controls on a gas cooker .
a man who had just bought a new cooker was unaware that the knobs for the two back rings turned clockwise to increase the heat , while the two front rings operated in the reverse direction .
he put some oil in a frying pan on what he thought was a low setting and , while chopping an onion , the pan caught fire because he had in fact turned up the ring to the highest setting .

bbc news entertainment reporter ian youngs was among the crowds and has been filing regular updates on events at the festival .
monday 27 june : 0850 bst three days ago , i waded along the banks of the overflowing whitelake river to fetch wellies from my car .
today the same path has returned to being dry and firm and the river has gone back to being a steady , low stream .
fans begin trek home this will be remembered as the flooded glastonbury .
the deluge was dramatic at the time and disastrous for those whose tents were overwhelmed .
but after the severe but brief downpours , most fans soon got back to the business of having a good time with remarkable ease .
in many ways , it was better to have had all the rain in one short , sharp burst .
constant light rain would have been more depressing , and the authorities were able to deal with much of the mud by the end of the weekend .
glastonbury always looks like a bit of a war zone on a monday morning at the best of times , and the clean-up operation has already begun .
litter-pickers are out in force , the stages are being dismantled and green patches are reappearing on the fields as tents are packed up .
and it is quiet - which , for glastonbury , is very eerie .
the exodus of refugees is under way , with everyone on a massive comedown as a return to reality looms after a weekend to remember .
monday 27 june : 0035 bst this was supposed to be kylie 's night , but in the end basement jaxx proved to be worthy replacements .
they really know how to put on a show .
the music is pumped-up feel-good pop and the flamboyant singers turned in a great performance .
there were constant costume changes - cart-wheeling on to stage in a cheerleader 's outfit at one point , wearing a chain of bullets for another song , and later dancing in stilettos .
they were not kylie - she would have been something special - but they ended the festival with a bang .
sunday 26 june : 1445 bst it may be the last day and it may be sunny , but the battle with the mud continues .
mechanical diggers are scraping out some quagmires , and hay is being laid down in more watery areas .
meanwhile , fresh farm milk is being sold from trailers with the cry : " keep your pecker up all night , boys , with milk . "
sunday 26 june : 1345 bst george galloway , pictured on saturday at the festival who should come strolling through the backstage area , wearing a pink shirt and clutching a cigar , but george galloway mp ?
he was speaking yesterday and again today in the green futures field about " capitalism , poverty , war , and how to beat it " , he tells me .
the respect mp said he thought the festival was " terrific " .
" i 'm really enjoying it , i 'm looking forward to seeing van morrison this afternoon , " he added .
sunday 26 june : 1250 bst my hay fever has come back with a vengeance , which can only mean one thing - the sun has come back .
the heat has returned for the festival 's final day , the mood is appropriately sunny and the mud is starting to dry out .
i am thinking about venturing out without my wellies for the first time since friday morning - which hopefully will not be tempting fate .
sunday 26 june : 0200 bst chris martin is rapidly becoming one of britain 's great eccentrics at the age of 28 .
coldplay win over fans in coldplay 's saturday headline slot at glastonbury , he thanked the festival 's founder by writing michael on his right knee and eavis on his left .
then there were his armpits .
his long-sleeved black shirt had slits in the armpits .
there were no tufts of hair poking through , but still , it was rather odd .
a few other touches confirmed his ease with such a big stage .
he took some photos of the crowds before throwing his camera into the audience .
he changed his lyrics off the cuff , running out of things to sing at one point , while he showed his sense for the surreal when dedicating one song .
" this is for johnny cash , " he began solemnly .
" and my dad also .
and for gay dad , who played here some years ago .
and for my two dads - remember my two dads ? "
overall , it was a triumph .
i just wish i had not been standing next to a woman who spent half the set pestering me to put the little britain catchphrase " ooh , you 're gorgeous " into my copy .
there it is , you nutter , wherever you are .
saturday 25 june : 1645 bst the glastonbury moments are coming thick and fast .
over at the acoustic stage the tent was packed for chas & dave .
i could see just enough to make out that every pair of arms in the tent was swaying in the air .
time for a comeback ?
saturday 25 june : 1615 bst geldof rallies glastonbury bob geldof is one of the few people who can make tens of thousands of people in a field shut up and listen .
when michael eavis gave him an emotional introduction on the pyramid stage , for the " make poverty history moment " , the crowd gave them both heroes ' welcomes .
with the threat of cynicism creeping into the public 's perception of bob geldof , there was a chance of a dodgy reception .
but that did not happen .
he told fans they did n't have to join hands for the show of support , but everybody i saw did , and without too much awkwardness .
he swept them up with the power of his personality .
when he finished there were a few tears and hugs , before everyone got back to the rock action .
saturday 25 june : 1535 bst a civilised way to catch the bands as well as the cath kidston tents , the other must-have accessory for this year 's discerning festival-goer appears to be a folding camping chair .
there are ranks of them on the pyramid field .
it reminds me of seaside towns where ageing folk sit in rows of deckchairs in front of a bandstand .
some may say they 're not very glastonbury , but at least they are a good way to sit down without getting muddy .
saturday 25 june : 0945 bst some enjoy the mud more than others the person who said mud was glorious was having a laugh .
i think i now have at least a bit of mud on just about everything i own , and there are still two days to go .
even the shortest trip to the toilet requires yanking wellies on and off and clumping through loads of the sticky stuff .
it is overcast here now and looks like it could either brighten up or go rapidly downhill again .
the forecast says there will be sunny intervals .
i just hope it is right .
saturday 25 june : 0100 bst keeping the noise down the silent disco is slightly bizarre .
with the headphones on , you are enveloped in sound and it would be easy to get lost in the music in your own little world - an insular rather than communal experience .
with the headphones off , it is a bunch of people dancing to nothing , which is equally strange .
but by taking the headphones off , at least you can actually hear other people speak , unlike most clubs .
i just wish the disco near my tent was silent .
friday 24 june : 1645 bst ian youngs - with wellies on the rain has stopped and the sun is trying its best to come out .
what was a farm with several new rivers flowing through it this morning is now a site that still has quite a few large swamps .
mostly , though , it 's just shallow mud .
the bands are in full swing after a two-hour delay .
it seems that the crowds have all but forgotten about this morning 's traumas .
friday 24 june : 1305 bst the strangest sight so far at glastonbury was 20-year-old stuart chappell from somerset swimming to his tent .
literally , doing the front crawl .
this festival-goer swam to his tent in a hunt for car keys in pictures he was hoping to retrieve his car keys , but he did n't find them .
his tent was in the most unfortunate part of the site , where dozens found their tents almost completely submerged .
mr chappell retrieved a few bags from his tent and that of a friend before wading back - up to his neck - to shore .
friday 24 june : 1115 bst i 've seen mud at glastonbury before , but not this much water .
it was not the best idea to leave my wellies in the car .
when i went to retrieve them , i had to cross the rivers that have suddenly sprung up on site .
i had to take off my shoes and wade through them barefoot .
the unlucky ones have pitched their tents on spaces that are now in those rivers .
the whole site is just very , very wet .
but people are not letting it wash their spirits away - yet .
friday 24 june : 0925 bst i know they said storms were on the cards but this is ridiculous .
wish you were here ?
the sound of the rain is so loud that from inside , the press tent sounds like it is in the middle of a raging torrent , not a farm in somerset in midsummer .
yesterday , michael eavis said thunderstorms were due to arrive at 0500 bst and he was pretty much spot on .
the thunder and lightning seem so close that i would not be surprised if the glastonbury tor gets a few direct hits .
running from my tent to the press area , lots of the ground was already waterlogged and churning up .
i dread to think what the rest of the site is going to look like - i just wish i had not left my wellies in my car .
friday 24 june : 0100 bst one of the highlights of the festival is always a trip up to the sacred space on the thursday night , while there is no music to distract you .
revellers lit lanterns and candles at the sacred space the sacred space , where a stone circle is located , is on a hill leading up to the highest point of the site .
people congregate there all day , but especially at night and at sunrise - and at midnight tonight they were there in their thousands , many with huge candles stuck into the ground , looking great in the dark .
it is a place to escape some of the hectic and noisy parts of the festival , and also to look down on the site , which appears like an otherworldly city with its bonfires and strings of lights in the distance .
and tonight , cheers swept the space as small , lantern-like hot air balloons , powered by small flames , rose into the sky .
thursday 23 june : 1725 bst floral dance : designer owners risk stumbling into each other 's tents the most visible brand is not one of the sponsors .
it 's cath kidston - the modern laura ashley .
her floral designs , which have become the adopted by the posh ladies of london 's notting hill , are a common sight across the fields .
they may not be associated with the traditional glastonbury crowd , but kidston-designed tents are everywhere .
it may have had a reputation as an exclusive luxury brand , but the distinctive floral tents have captured the hearts of a section of glastonbury festival-goers .
i saw 20 within an hour of walking around the site , then gave up counting .
thursday 23 june : 1400 bst the crowds are descending on rural somerset for another year , and michael eavis ' farm is filling up before the music starts tomorrow .
a steady stream of bodies is trundling across the pyramid stage field with rucksacks and tents to find a spot to call home for the next four days .
festival-goers are preparing for all weathers the site is not too crowded yet - but by this time tomorrow , double the number will be here and the campsites , like the toilets , will be overflowing .
with no bands to watch today , i am watching the skies instead , because the good weather is not expected to last .
the heat has its problems , but i would prefer constant sun to constant rain , which is much harder work .
there could be storms and downpours from tonight , so i have packed for all eventualities .
sandals and wellies , sun cream and rain coat , shorts and waterproof trousers , i hope i am set for what could be four seasons in one weekend .

bbc news entertainment reporter ian youngs was among the crowds and has been filing regular updates on events at the festival .
monday 27 june : 0850 bst three days ago , i waded along the banks of the overflowing whitelake river to fetch wellies from my car .
today the same path has returned to being dry and firm and the river has gone back to being a steady , low stream .
fans begin trek home this will be remembered as the flooded glastonbury .
the deluge was dramatic at the time and disastrous for those whose tents were overwhelmed .
but after the severe but brief downpours , most fans soon got back to the business of having a good time with remarkable ease .
in many ways , it was better to have had all the rain in one short , sharp burst .
constant light rain would have been more depressing , and the authorities were able to deal with much of the mud by the end of the weekend .
glastonbury always looks like a bit of a war zone on a monday morning at the best of times , and the clean-up operation has already begun .
litter-pickers are out in force , the stages are being dismantled and green patches are reappearing on the fields as tents are packed up .
and it is quiet - which , for glastonbury , is very eerie .
the exodus of refugees is under way , with everyone on a massive comedown as a return to reality looms after a weekend to remember .
monday 27 june : 0035 bst this was supposed to be kylie 's night , but in the end basement jaxx proved to be worthy replacements .
they really know how to put on a show .
the music is pumped-up feel-good pop and the flamboyant singers turned in a great performance .
there were constant costume changes - cart-wheeling on to stage in a cheerleader 's outfit at one point , wearing a chain of bullets for another song , and later dancing in stilettos .
they were not kylie - she would have been something special - but they ended the festival with a bang .
sunday 26 june : 1445 bst it may be the last day and it may be sunny , but the battle with the mud continues .
mechanical diggers are scraping out some quagmires , and hay is being laid down in more watery areas .
meanwhile , fresh farm milk is being sold from trailers with the cry : " keep your pecker up all night , boys , with milk . "
sunday 26 june : 1345 bst george galloway , pictured on saturday at the festival who should come strolling through the backstage area , wearing a pink shirt and clutching a cigar , but george galloway mp ?
he was speaking yesterday and again today in the green futures field about " capitalism , poverty , war , and how to beat it " , he tells me .
the respect mp said he thought the festival was " terrific " .
" i 'm really enjoying it , i 'm looking forward to seeing van morrison this afternoon , " he added .
sunday 26 june : 1250 bst my hay fever has come back with a vengeance , which can only mean one thing - the sun has come back .
the heat has returned for the festival 's final day , the mood is appropriately sunny and the mud is starting to dry out .
i am thinking about venturing out without my wellies for the first time since friday morning - which hopefully will not be tempting fate .
sunday 26 june : 0200 bst chris martin is rapidly becoming one of britain 's great eccentrics at the age of 28 .
coldplay win over fans in coldplay 's saturday headline slot at glastonbury , he thanked the festival 's founder by writing michael on his right knee and eavis on his left .
then there were his armpits .
his long-sleeved black shirt had slits in the armpits .
there were no tufts of hair poking through , but still , it was rather odd .
a few other touches confirmed his ease with such a big stage .
he took some photos of the crowds before throwing his camera into the audience .
he changed his lyrics off the cuff , running out of things to sing at one point , while he showed his sense for the surreal when dedicating one song .
" this is for johnny cash , " he began solemnly .
" and my dad also .
and for gay dad , who played here some years ago .
and for my two dads - remember my two dads ? "
overall , it was a triumph .
i just wish i had not been standing next to a woman who spent half the set pestering me to put the little britain catchphrase " ooh , you 're gorgeous " into my copy .
there it is , you nutter , wherever you are .
saturday 25 june : 1645 bst the glastonbury moments are coming thick and fast .
over at the acoustic stage the tent was packed for chas & dave .
i could see just enough to make out that every pair of arms in the tent was swaying in the air .
time for a comeback ?
saturday 25 june : 1615 bst geldof rallies glastonbury bob geldof is one of the few people who can make tens of thousands of people in a field shut up and listen .
when michael eavis gave him an emotional introduction on the pyramid stage , for the " make poverty history moment " , the crowd gave them both heroes ' welcomes .
with the threat of cynicism creeping into the public 's perception of bob geldof , there was a chance of a dodgy reception .
but that did not happen .
he told fans they did n't have to join hands for the show of support , but everybody i saw did , and without too much awkwardness .
he swept them up with the power of his personality .
when he finished there were a few tears and hugs , before everyone got back to the rock action .
saturday 25 june : 1535 bst a civilised way to catch the bands as well as the cath kidston tents , the other must-have accessory for this year 's discerning festival-goer appears to be a folding camping chair .
there are ranks of them on the pyramid field .
it reminds me of seaside towns where ageing folk sit in rows of deckchairs in front of a bandstand .
some may say they 're not very glastonbury , but at least they are a good way to sit down without getting muddy .
saturday 25 june : 0945 bst some enjoy the mud more than others the person who said mud was glorious was having a laugh .
i think i now have at least a bit of mud on just about everything i own , and there are still two days to go .
even the shortest trip to the toilet requires yanking wellies on and off and clumping through loads of the sticky stuff .
it is overcast here now and looks like it could either brighten up or go rapidly downhill again .
the forecast says there will be sunny intervals .
i just hope it is right .
saturday 25 june : 0100 bst keeping the noise down the silent disco is slightly bizarre .
with the headphones on , you are enveloped in sound and it would be easy to get lost in the music in your own little world - an insular rather than communal experience .
with the headphones off , it is a bunch of people dancing to nothing , which is equally strange .

in him terms like conservative or progressive lose their meaning .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's ocean

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .

unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .

there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

watch talking point is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england the cultural argument is bogus axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk let 's focus on tourism and whale watching jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk whales are just like any other food source bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england some compromise is needed alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

is it acceptable to hunt whales ?
a bid to resume commercial whaling has been rejected by the international whaling commission .
the main whaling nations - norway , iceland and japan - argue that hunting some species is now sustainable .
the current international agreement permits some whales to be killed for scientific research and isolated arctic communities are allowed to catch a small number of whales for their subsistence needs .
do you agree with the iwc decision ?
should the whaling ban should be lifted ?
do whales deserve special conservation measures ?
we discussed whaling in our global phone-in talking point on sunday 26 june .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : since whales have been on the planet longer than us , the way i see it is they have more of a right to be here than we do .
keep the ban in place or we may find that future generations will be asking their parents and teachers what a whale was .
michelle , peterborough , uk i would have no problem with the japanese taking whales for research , so long as they signed on the dotted line that not one of them would end up being eaten .
this only proves that they are not really serious about the science .
ross walker , melbourne australia i 'm 100 % against the hunting of whales .
whales have the right to live on this planet exactly as we do .
that 's why , it 's our responsibility to protect those animals which complete an important chain in the biological system we are living in .
firas al-kabbani , dubai , uae " norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way " joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands small island states depend on fish for their economy and food .
what happens if the small fish around south pole , australia and new zealand are in short supply ?
the obvious thing is for these big animals to migrate to the equator and start competing with human beings .
by the time we realise it all our small fish will be gone .
islands in the pacific do not have the ability to keep the whale population from its small fish stocks .
so norway , iceland and japan are helping us in a positive way .
joses sanga , honiara , solomon islands ca n't we just leave these beautiful creatures in peace ?
hunting nations argue that ' hunting some species is sustainable ' .
famous last story !
live and let live i say .
nicola courtney , the hague , the netherlands there never should have been a complete ban on commercial whaling .
a scaling back , yes , but as the whaling population recovers , the ban should be lifted .
too many so-called environmentalists believe that these bans should last " forever " - nonsense !
tom coffey , hartford , usa before we criticise the japanese we should ensure the eu stops killing dolphins with its fishing methods .
ian baldwin , buntingford , england " the cultural argument is bogus " axel , charlotte , usa for one thing , the cultural argument is bogus ; japan is quite a modern country , especially in food culture , and younger japanese that i have met never tasted whale meat .
with the introduction of whale burger , maybe they will try for the " cool " of it .
axel , charlotte , usa it 's unfortunate that sea life and mammals in general are hunted .
i wish all forms of sport hunting were banned .
why do we feel less if a deer is shot by a hunter , but , if a whale is killed , that is wrong , and protested ?
we still have not clearly made the distinctions that killing for pleasure is wrong ?
to sustain life is one thing , done humanely as all life is important , but to kill for sport and fun , no thanks !
robyn , usa i notice a lot of people mention farm animals when they talk about how it 's okay to kill whales .
i am of the opinion that an animal that is being husbanded and kept in special surroundings where it is safe from all other predators is in a different category than whales which are at the mercy of the elements and other natural killers .
i also think that scientific research would be much more useful done on living animals rather than dead ones .
how can we know how an animal lives if we kill it first ?
jessie , toronto , canada leave the whales to the inuit on a controlled basis .
allow these magnificent whales the opportunity to flourish so all mankind may enjoy their beauty and splendid grace .
j. baillon , phoenix , az , usa the whaling ban should be strengthened !
global warming and the effect of massive pollution of the oceans are just beginning to show their effects .
whale populations must be allowed to grow as much as possible since the effects of climate change are just starting .
steve slater , haiku , hi , usa whales seem to be surviving at current levels .
ban should continue as they are , or if not be doubled .
seas are polluted in many ways ; whales may be just surviving , not thriving .
populations should be monitored for at least another decade before lifting whaling bans .
lucy boyce , port matilda , pa u.s.a. "
i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate " chris pook , plymouth as a marine biologist who has studied the arguments for and against whaling i think the ban should be lifted .
nations who have a historic association with whaling for survival should be allowed to retain such a large part of their culture .
as for the arguments regarding ethics i do n't hear many people complaining about the way halal or kosher butchers operate .
in addition the moratorium on whaling is deeply flawed as it concentrates protection on a handful of well known species whilst other smaller cetacean species are vulnerable to continued fishing effort without any protection ; a situation which has driven many species to the brink of extinction , such as dall 's porpoise .
management programs should be based on sound science and nothing else .
chris pook , plymouth , uk ban or no ban , whaling continues .
on my last trip to norway -lrb- as on most of my trips to norway -rrb- i ate whale meat .
i like it .
as someone else pointed out , pigs are also intelligent , yet few people are demanding a ban on killing pigs , and many food animals are far more beautiful as well .
so , if you do n't want to eat whale meat , then do n't , but please do n't tell me or anyone else what we are allowed to eat .
tom o 'hara , lugano , switzerland " caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban " john byrd , durango , colorado the pro-whaling group seems to argue that there is a level of whaling that could occur today that would maintain populations at their current level .
but that assumes that current whale populations are appropriate .
given the impact of whaling up to the ban in 1986 it is hard to believe that whale populations are anywhere near what the eco-system can support or what is ideal for the indefinite survival of whales .
until we know a lot about whale reproduction , growth and susceptibility to natural events , a sustainable harvest target can not be developed without putting whale populations at risk .
since an error in setting a ' sustainable ' harvest target could do irreversible harm -lrb- i.e. , extinction -rrb- caution argues for maintaining or even strengthening the ban .
john byrd , durango , colorado , usa i ca n't understand why some people are saying that inuits should have the right to hunt whale , but no-one else .
i am undecided on the issue , but surely there should be one rule for everyone ?
tom , japan many japanese citizens actually do n't know about this issue .
it 's never covered in the tv news or in japan newspapers .
i 'm so disappointed with the japanese government .
i hope in the future there will be no catching whales .
we do n't need that old style , we can remember old culture without practising it .
please make your voices louder because the japanese government is a little bit deaf .
kana ohsako , tokyo , japan people should focus on scientific discussion about sustainability , not on emotional and subjective claims about whales ' beauty or on fishy myths concerning their intelligence .
it is incomprehensible that people who strongly condemn whaling do not seem to be particularly opposed to hunting and sports fishing , which are about killing animals just for fun and provide animals with much longer pain than whaling does .
jun , tokyo , japan " whaling as a tradition " is no reason to resume it .
through modern life so many traditions have been given up .
when there are no more whales left , the tradition dies anyway .
better give it up now .
rolf lattmann , mombasa , kenya " the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures " t joensen , faroe islands the whaling ban must be lifted .
whales do indeed belong to all peoples of the world , not just australia , new zealand or the other countries that oppose whaling .
let 's face it , the anti-whaling nations do not see the whale as a food source .
therein lies the real problem .
the iwc meeting in south korea is a clash of ' food ' cultures .
t joensen , faroe islands i am fed up with individuals and nations hiding behind their " culture " as an excuse for the barbaric , unnecessary killing of sentient creatures .
at some point we must all look beyond ourselves and our selfish desires in order to protect this planet and its inhabitants -lrb- and i include my own country in this admonishment -rrb- .
whaling should unquestionably be banned permanently .
m nichol , ft lauderdale , fl , usa to hunt a creature so near to dying out completely for no reason other than bogus " scientific purposes " is a huge step backwards for both whales as well as mankind .
no matter what their scientific findings are , we can never truly evolve if we keep reaching backwards into unnecessary barbarism .
rana , new york , usa the ban should definitely not be lifted - ' scientific research ' , it 's just a ruse to eat them .
if it was so called research then they must have found out all there ever could be about them !
our world would definitely be a worse place without whales and ' tradition ' will never justify any killing .
alison sinclair , uk " we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo " kathleen hodgson , australia there are only 4000 humpbacks left .
how can anyone think that if 50 were hunted a year , their numbers would be sustainable ?
all whale hunting should be stopped .
we do n't want the whales to go the way of the dodo .
kathleen hodgson , australia the best way to decide the fate of whales is to go and see them in the wild .
i 'll be doing that this weekend .
a whale surfacing in front of a boat or kayak , will give the viewer a clear answer to what our roles with whales should be , and that is for once leave something alone .
terry dillon , north vancouver , bc whaling is an unacceptable and useless form of commerce .
the oceans have long been treated as an inexhaustible food supply , but quite simply we ca n't just keep taking .
whale populations are fragile , and it is up to humans to make sure that their kind do not go extinct .
those who claim extinction is ' natural ' and that humans are merely acting as tools of nature do n't seem to notice that animals being dragged from the oceans by the dozen and killed , cleaned and cooked by a factory ship are n't experiencing anything " natural " .
if we do n't stop commercial whaling , the entire ecosystem that whales exist in will fall out of balance , and quite simply , humans have done enough damage to the oceans as it is .
monique collins , ma , us " whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans - all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner " vernon , naashville lots of interesting comments , mostly from people who romanticize these beasts .
i wonder how many of them have ever tasted whale ?
it 's awful !
but , whales are no different from tuna , trees or soybeans .
all of which are harvested in a sustainable manner .
vernon , naashville , usa absolutely not , its disgusting , hunting whale - is a crime against nature .
the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- must keep the ban on whale hunting .
emil , baku azerbaijan how can you say that hunting , and killing a whale , or any living creature is for the sake of science ?
that makes about as much sense as cosmetic testing on animals .
the only way it will serve any purpose for scientific research is if the animal is kept alive , but clearly that is not what happens here .
christian seith , sandy spring , maryland , usa everything comes down to economics at the end .
if anti-whaling europeans and americans feel strongly enough , simply stop buying any japanese products , electronics , cars , motorbikes etc and see how long it takes the japanese government to have a re-think on the necessity of whaling .
even a 1 % drop in global consumer spending on japanese products would probably do the job !
andrew lynch , geneva " those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling " akira tsutsumi , japan i think many of us -lrb- japanese -rrb- keep quiet on this issue .
because we think those who do n't eat whale meat do n't understand why we want to resume commercial whaling .
and we are fed up with the no-whaling nations who do not try to understand the different culture and have a " we are always right " attitude .
akira tsutsumi , nara , japan whales should never be hunted .
they , like elephants care for there young and care for one another .
only the inuit should be allowed to hunt whale .
whale hunting for profit should be banned forever .
keenan phelps , silver spring , md usa keenan phelps : if the inuit can hunt whales based on tradition why ca n't the japanese ?
japanese whaling is just as much as a tradition as inuit whaling .
if the world is to have a whaling ban then it needs to be a total ban without exception .
anon , usa sustainability is the key .
anyone who thinks whales and tuna or cod are the same issue needs to think a little more before declaring their ignorance to the nation on a message board such as this .
lee hambly , uk it is not logical to hunt a species to extinction .
once commercial whaling is resumed , numbers would rapidly begin to decline .
john , honolulu , us " humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason " sheelah dunn dooley , canada the whaling ban should not be lifted .
with the exception of indigenous peoples of the north , such as inuit , -lrb- not nation states as in norway and iceland -rrb- , humans neither have the need , nor the right to kill whales for any reason .
sheelah dunn dooley , ontario , canada despite my feeling that whales are truly impressive , it is still reasonable to ask why it would matter if they became extinct .
that is both natural and normal for every species , and most are pushed out by new comers - humans are not the only species that destroy others , merely the most efficient to date , and we wo n't be around forever either .
peter filicietti , bangkok , thailand until the anti whaling crowd drop the sentimentalised view of whales as cuddly -lrb- killer whales are anything but -rrb- and highly intelligent -lrb- so are pigs -rrb- and engage on the basis of managing and protecting the species of whales which are endangered -lrb- several are not , including minke whales -rrb- they risk losing the debate to the whalers .
tom , london , england my heart tells me to protect whales , but i am not sure of the answer to the question , why is it acceptable to eat cod , tuna etc , but not whale ?
rob greaves , cheshire , uk " let 's focus on tourism and whale watching " jana , austin , usa just like the overfishing and destruction of all animals on this planet , the whales too will once again be endangered if the ban is lifted .
let 's focus on tourism and whale watching - not the senseless destruction of life .
jana , austin , usa i personally do n't agree with whaling but i am dumbfounded by the attitude of people who wish to deny that humans are at the top of the food chain .
hunting is a natural instinct , without which we would not have survived and an animal that lives free and is hunted has a far better quality of life -lrb- and death -rrb- than a factory farmed chicken .
sally , sheffield , uk everyone knows that this " research " stuff is just a joke .
whales are beautiful sensitive living beings , not something to be " harvested " .
humans may realise one day that killing is n't the solution .
robert ellis , brescia , italy it is a huge step backward for the evolution of humankind to allow the unnecessary killing of one of the earth 's oldest and greatest creatures kim tomlin , wanaka , new zealand i am so tired of hearing the argument that things should be the way they were in the past .
nothing stays the same nor has it ever .
we must adapt to changes such as the drastic decrease in whale numbers .
we must live in the present .
the value of feeding our families is a good one but no-one has to kill whales to eat .
more tofu ... less whale !
mindy gelder , iwakuni , japan -lrb- us citizen -rrb- whaling should be banned indefinitely .
whales have a naturally high mortality rate as it is .
just another example of how the human race is the only species that has failed to adapt to its environment .
angela cruickshank , medicine hat , alberta i personally believe that whales should be protected indefinitely .
it is a matter of conservation of an endangered species rather than just a case of preferential treatment towards certain animals .
however , even if you take the obvious emotive element out of the subject , and you are still left with the scientific fact - whales were very nearly hunted out of existence and the current populations simply can not withstand a return to hunting .
david redfearn , worksop " eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west " rachel , leicester eating whale in japan is no more or no less barbaric than eating tuna in the west .
the only concern anyone should have is whether the hunting is done in a sustainable manner to ensure that these and other animals that humans feast on do n't become extinct .
rachel , leicester , uk we have over-fished and over-hunted every species that we have come across .
the results are beginning to appear horrendous , whether it be turtles or marlin or cod ; we are endangering every species .
the only way forward for future generations is good management , which will impose fair and sustainable harvesting .
the crisis is truly global , and no one country can claim that it has special " needs " .
and we all know that the japanese claim of harvesting for " research " is bogus .
the whaling issue is just like everything else that seems intuitive - subject to total political corruption .
time for a global parliament ?
ian , bethel , ct , usa i strongly feel the global ban on whaling should be continued in perpetuity .
the problem , however , is that whale populations are dying from immune disorder diseases before their reproductive age , from the effects of pollution -lrb- pcbs -rrb- .
result : very few whales are being born ; too few to maintain a stable population .
titus meissner , napa , california , usa why not .
we hunt other animals .
we raise animals in cages , kill them and eat them , so what 's the difference ?
we eat steak , chicken , lamb , for food and we use their skins and bodies for clothing , textiles etc .
why is one animal excluded while others are not ?
is it because they are " smart " .
or is it because the killing of other animals for food and clothing occurs behind closed doors where we do n't need face the reality of the slaughter .
only hypocrites say no to one and yes to another .
michael s nowak , indiana , pa , usa " it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good " derek hunter , lyndhurst the whales are a natural resource that belongs to the world to leave as a legacy for future generations to enjoy .
it is time for the world to stand up with the courage to ban the practice for good .
if we can do it for poverty in africa lets do it for the whales .
derek hunter , lyndhurst , hampshire i 've always had a problem with consuming the meat of an animal that is possibly more intelligent than my own species .
it may sound strange , but that 's how i feel .
i now live in the arctic where the inuvialuit annually hunt beluga whales and hold not only the bounty but the experience as a sacred part of their culture .
however , these western arctic people never take more than can be used in a season and use nearly every bit of the animal .
commercial operations are an entirely different kettle of fish and need to be strictly monitored .
sure the japanese , norwegians and icelandic whaling operations will contend that the ' food source ' is sustainable but i 'm sceptical at best .
jason unrau , inuvik , canada there just is no good reason for any nation to hunt whales in modern times .
sustainable or not .
i 'm really surprised at norway , japan and iceland insisting on this .
all countries very respected by the world community , with highly educated population and considered culturally advanced .
for me this " cultural " attitude towards whaling is disturbing .
peter curtis , tamarac , fl , usa those who try to apologise for whaling as being part of a country 's culture should remember that slavery and killing " witches " were part of our culture until people realised that what they were doing was so very wrong .
andrew , london , uk " the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's no " ryan nielson , ireland the simple fact is , whaling was once sustainable - now it 's not .
post war over-fishing has depleted stock levels to the extent that the industry , and the jobs it offered , have been lost .
if companies wish to whale , let them start private pods , but hunting wild pods is no longer a realistic option .
ryan nielson , ireland there has always been a whiff of cultural imperialism about the whaling debate .
perhaps we should stop killing cows and instead admire them for their grace and beauty .
john kearney , canada the ban should not be lifted .
the whaling nations should put their efforts into establishing whale-watching tourist ventures .
new zealand and australia have found this far more profitable than the whaling nations have from the sale of whale meat for human consumption .
andrew clark , dunedin , new zealand japan , norway , iceland and the other whaling nations should have the right to hunt whales as much as they like . inside their own waters .
any further than the 12 mile national limit and their whaling boats should be arrested and impounded .
they do n't own the world 's whales and do n't have the right to destroy them .
john r smith , uk " it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice " andy white , usa it is disgusting that whaling , in the 21st century , is even being discussed .
pray tell , japan et al . , just what ' scientific ' gains you are making by culling one of the planet 's most intelligent and graceful mammals .
it is nothing more than a barbaric and backward practice .
andy white , va , usa it 's sick that they are even thinking about lifting the ban , how can you kill such a magnificent animal ?
there is just no good reason why it should be done and lifting the ban should n't even be considered .
hannah , cardiff , wales the killing of apes is considered abhorrent because they are intelligent creatures very closely related to ourselves .
of course it helps that they resemble humans .
why should whales get any lesser consideration just because they 're adapted to the oceans rather than the land ?
whaling has no place in the 21st century .
andrew , cardiff , uk " whales are just like any other food source " bob , us whales are just like any other food source .
as long as the population can be sustained there is absolutely no reason not to hunt them .
bob , us well , well .
is n't it remarkable how quickly people forget ... have we forgotten the campaigning of so many people and organisations who initially pressured the international community to stop whaling altogether .
have we failed to recall the documentaries on our televisions describing whales and their behaviour as arguably more civilised than our own , never mind their intelligence .
these people who worked so hard did so from a scientific and academic point of view , not emotional .
the whaling companies will be interested in competing for profit , not sustainable management ... if you do not believe this then just look at the situation in our own domestic fishing industry .
this decision will send us backwards and is a retrograde barbarism of our developing civilised society .
we must learn to respect other species even if we can not do so with each other ... for our own long term survival .
r baldwin , high witcombe , uk whale stocks have not recovered sufficiently for truly " sustainable whaling " to be an option .
whaling is not important economically for any of the nations that want to pursue it .
peter kaufmann , annandale , usa whaling is only necessary to the survival of a few indigenous people in rural communities .
whaling for fun or for money is unacceptable .
the ocean belongs to sea life and is shared by all .
whitney , roswell , usa the anti-whaling nations should turn the tables on japan in the iwc .
pack the iwc with anti-whaling countries .
the iwc website says that " membership of the iwc is open to any country in the world that formally adheres to the 1946 convention . " ... cool .
pay these countries ' membership fees -lrb- should be pretty small i guess -rrb- and own their vote !
rajesh , bangalore , india it 's pretty obvious this issue is coming to a crisis : where one stands depends on how one sees whales .
fairly obviously , the numbers of at least some species have recovered to the point where they could survive regulated hunting .
this leaves the question : is it moral to hunt whales at all ?
are they like men , whom of course would be off limits regardless of their numbers , or like giant sea-going pigs , a resource which may be exploited with a perfectly clear conscience by most ?
those who tend towards the former view will continue to vehemently oppose whaling almost regardless of the numbers they reach , while those who tend towards the latter will of course favour an increase in hunting quotas as the stocks continue to increase .
colin wright , richmond , ca , usa to say that non-whaling nations have no right to get involved in whaling nations ' business and that whaling nations should be free to hunt whales within their national borders or on the high seas totally misses the point .
just how will whaling nations take steps to protect diminishing whale populations ?
this is contrary to political will and commercial interests .
whales are a unique and delicate part of our natural heritage , which should be enjoyed and protected by the world community and its descendants .
protection of that heritage transcends national and commercial interests .
robert morgan , port douglas , australia whaling is a very cruel practice to intelligent and already environmentally impacted creatures , no land animal would ever be treated this way !
karl fuller , auckland new zealand all reasonable efforts should be made to avoid the extermination of any life form .
in the case of whales , the " reasonable " effort is to simply not hunt them .
japan and norway are rich countries that have no " scientific " arguments to continue the hunt .
michael , calif , usa to say that only whaling nations should have a say in conservation issues is ludicrous .
whales are endangered just as many african , asian and american species .
should european nations then stand aside and let be what be ?
all conservation of flora and fauna is for the benefit of all , not just for those who are to make money off it .
andy campbell , london , uk i do n't think that we should get involved in what japan is doing and how many whales it kills .
their laws do n't apply to us so why should we worry ?
we make up our laws and they make up theirs , it 's not our business .
alex young , grantham , lincolnshire if this is about economics and japan protecting their whaling industry then i say do n't buy japanese products .
if enough people took this action then we 'd soon see a change of stance .
graham martin , brighton , uk " current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago " kathleen harrison , new mills what do norway and japan learn from the whales that they currently catch for ' scientific proposes ' ?
i have yet to see any studies published on the knowledge that has been gained from the continued hunting .
while some may say that it is fine to hunt whales if they are within national waters , who are we to say a mammal should die because it strays too close to one country , when its environment is the whole ocean ?
current whale population levels are nowhere near what they were hundreds of years ago and to claim that the growing whale population is to blame for fish stock depletion is ridiculous .
kathleen harrison , new mills , england we do n't know enough to say levels of ' whales ' are sustainable .
continued over fishing by humans will cause whale numbers to drop .
until we have an efficient system for monitoring all marine life , it will be best for all sides concerned -lrb- commercial and otherwise -rrb- to err on the side of caution .
dr j taylor , london , england why is this even being considered ?
japan should be made to explain how whales caught for scientific purposes are ending up as food for the japanese .
where are the scientific findings produced from these captured whales ?
why is there no accountability ?
beth , kentwood , michigan , usa if these countries insist on hunting whales , they should be forced to investigate a way of either encouraging whale numbers , or be able to farm them successfully .
if not , they should not be allowed to kill a species we already know is on the decline .
ns , dorset , england " some compromise is needed " alan brown , london i have tasted whale meat and it is delicious , possibly the best meat i have eaten .
i understand the whaling nations love of the meat , which is part of their culture .
whale numbers are rising , and sustainable whaling , properly enforced , would enable millions of people to enjoy this wonderful source of food .
the green activists would never be placated anyway , so some compromise is needed .
alan brown , london no , it 's cruel , nasty and it puts the animals through terrible pain .
no the ban should stay .
brendan chilton , great britain the countries shouting most loudly about whaling are themselves responsible for hunting less glamorous species like cod to near-extinction .
it 's totally hypocritical that they should try to impose controls on japan and iceland without accepting limits on their own industries .
julia hayward , st neots , uk i 'm from new zealand , and as such see no logic or right for northern hemisphere countries to be hunting in the southern oceans of the world .
if they want to catch whales then they should conduct hunting in their own areas .
if they do n't have the whale populations in their areas then maybe this is a message to them that they are over-harvesting them .
scott brundell , new zealand how can japan say that the capture of whales is for scientific reasons if they can not produce any scientific data ?
whales should not be caught unless they prove a danger to humans and i ca n't remember hearing of any whales trying to hunt humans .
bruce eyre , amesbury , england hunting whales is never acceptable .
many are endangered , they migrate widely across the world 's oceans , so do n't " belong " to any country .
not to mention that they are intelligent mammals .
let 's just admire them for their grace and beauty .
paul f , houston , usa " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
john jones , london what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ?
if whale numbers are getting too small then it is for whaling nations to take the right steps to safeguard the future of their industries .
john jones , london , uk in the first place , john jones , whales are n't an " industry " but a living thing .
in the second , if you think countries will " safeguard their future " for profit and because it 's obviously the sensible thing to do , then you are naive .
they will do just as humans always do , namely exploit the " resource " in question as fast as they can until it is exhausted .
s burns , wales john jones of london asks , " what business is it of non-whaling nations to get involved in whaling nations business ? "
the implication of this question seems to be that somehow a wrong is less wrong if carried out by some other country .
i do n't subscribe to that argument .
i will always reserve the right to speak out against cruelty wherever it happens as in this case .
it is my right and my duty .
patrick , orpington kent japan should n't have the freedom to hunt whales within their own waters .
whales are migratory animals not only confined to japan 's waters - it is an international decision that should be made .
mason , london , england if the killing of whales is indeed for purely scientific purposes then surely whaling nations will have no issue with banning the consumption of whale meat .
dan , auckland , nz let 's not forget that there is no humane method of killing these animals and that death is a drawn out and cruel affair .
for a country like japan whose general population are ambivalent about eating whale -lrb- and it is already freely available here on supermarket shelves under the dishonest guise of scientific whaling -rrb- this really has to be taken into account in any discussion .
amp , okinawa , japan " whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation " adrian phillips , evesham whales migrate across the world 's oceans so they do not ' belong ' to any one nation .
this is one reason why the killing of them by the japanese , norwegians and icelanders is unacceptable .
as most nations oppose the resumption of whaling , the whaling nations have no right to impose their values on the rest of us .
adrian phillips , evesham , uk i think this issue should be discussed purely from the viewpoint of whether hunting whales would be sustainable or not , just like any other marine resources .
some opinions seem to be from the viewpoint of abhorring consumption of whale meat , but eating whales has a long history among many cultures .
at least i do n't think eating whales is comparable to eating chimps or gorillas .
akira nagasaki , tokyo , japan as long as the whales are hunted in a sustainable way then i see no problem with it .
i 'm sure a lot of the people who speak out against whaling are just acting on emotion rather than looking at the scientific realities .
james , uk the whales have to be preserved rather than hunted .
marine life and whales are already under enough pressure from pollution and climate changes as well as loss of breeding grounds etc .
jed burdon , bolton uk " as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted " richard t ketchum as the whale population rises the fish stocks are being depleted .
has anyone stopped to think these may be connected ?
richard t. ketchum , usa to richard t ketchum , usa : no being on this earth is another 's property .
a country 's self governing / regulation has never worked .
anywhere .
unless your are eating plankton do n't worry about what the whales are eating .
for the whales that do eat fish , fish and whales have existed for millions of years together .
the drop in numbers has not happened until man started getting involved .
we are the problem , not them .
we have other choices of food , they do not .
scott thomas , wisconsin , usa it always amuses me when people talk about whales and / or seals decimating fish stocks .
whales have existed for millions of years , fish for far longer .
there did n't seem to be much of a fish shortage until relatively modern times , when large-scale fishing by humans began .
john , edmonton , canada while some whale populations have increased following the international ban on commercial whaling , it is not clear that any have recovered sufficiently for the resumption of commercial whaling .
japan 's use of captured whales for " scientific purposes " is and always has been highly questionable .
iceland and norway have better claims to whaling as a traditional industry .
however , until or unless studies of whale populations indicate that some " harvest " is possible without risking extinction of species , all whaling should be severely limited .
dave woods , cleveland , usa absolutely not , except for research purposes .
if the whale species have recovered enough in some places mother nature will take care of that .
who are we to decide that some whales need to be killed because they are in abundance .
rupak thapaliya , minnesota , usa the moratorium on commercial whaling should only be lifted when sustainable commercial hunting is regulated and quotas enforced under international agreement .
eddie espie , cookstown , northern ireland " japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders " jay yes , japan should have the freedom to hunt whatever they like within their borders , like any other country .
jay do they really want to catch them for scientific purposes or is it for consumption under the pretext of science ?
nima , college park , usa if it was n't for the ban the whaling nations would never have stopped the slaughter and these wonderful , harmless creatures would have been extinct .
there is no justification , under any circumstances , for a return to whaling .
david , sussex , england the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- should not lift the ban .
instead , the iwc should tighten the restrictions on killing the whales because the 3 countries may continue to kill more whales , claiming that it is for scientific research when some or most of them end up on the dining table .

the un has estimated that 200,000 people are homeless as a result of the zimbabwe government 's action , and it has been reported that two children were crushed to death when the illegal structures they were in were demolished .
president robert mugabe says that the crackdown , currently in its fourth week , is needed to " restore sanity " to the urban areas , which he says have become overrun with criminals .
the african union has rejected calls from the us and the uk to put pressure on zimbabwe saying it had many more serious problems to consider than zimbabwe .
what do you think about the crackdown , known as operation murambatsvina -lsb- drive out rubbish -rsb- ?
is the african union right to reject becoming involved ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : mugabe 's biggest error was destroying the best run agricultural sector in africa , just so he could hold power a little longer .
this lead to poverty and starvation , which in turn , drove the country populace toward the cities , leading to the slums being created in the first place .
if the african union will not get involved , we should end our involvement in aid etc to any african union nation .
any cry of hypocrisy can simply be answered by this : if they ca n't be bothered to get their own house in order , why should we fund them ?
curtis , uk all we hear is cancel the debt , make poverty history , yet while we are supposed to clear the debts mugabe is clearing away homes and businesses , and the african union -lrb- wanting debts cleared -rrb- will not condemn him .
no human rights for africans no debt relief .
a.warner , bristol uk nepad was touted as africa providing good governance and encouraging investment and the west providing investment and aid .
if africa is unwilling to criticise and chastise mugabe , then the west should be unwilling to provide aid .
mike , worcester , uk the au says it had many more serious problems to consider than zimbabwe .
i think zimbabwe has already become a serious problem that will only be solved when the tyranny of robert mugabe finishes .
daniel fernandes , alverca , portugal the reason the africans are reluctant to do much is because they are suspicious that this noise by britain and the uk is another excuse to throw hot coals at the man who grabbed land from their friends .
a man who is not afraid to challenge the two superpowers .
princess , gaborone , botswana they are in effect saying corruption and murder is acceptable rod , uk i had family which had to leave zimbabwe due to the violence and problems .
i would have thought that after five years of seeing what is going on the au would have had some balls and acted .
by refusing to condemn mugabe they are in effect saying corruption and murder is acceptable .
as a result i for one will be campaigning -lrb- in any way i can -rrb- for aid , debt relief or fair trade to most african countries to be halted .
until they clean up their act they deserve no help .
rod , uk murderers like mugabe and his thugs have done far worse than this to our african brothers and sisters and gotten away with it while fools parrot the excuse he is somehow " standing up to western powers " .
god curse all africans for letting this happen - we never , ever learn .
until we can put aside tribal rivalries we will always be a little people .
julias gajani , uk -lrb- ex-ivory coast -rrb- i note that a spokesperson for the african union believes that these are the actions of an elected government , the implication being that the elections were fair .
i 'm not sure how many people actually believe that 's true .
but even if it is , there is no justification for the manner in which this is being carried out and the world should hang it 's head in shame for standing by and watching .
maybe it 's the beginning of the end for mr mugabe and zanu pf , but what a human price to pay for non-intervention .
mike widdop , weston super mare , england this is a bunch of hypocritical nonsense !
daniel , birmingham , al , usa this is a bunch of hypocritical nonsense !
it took months to get even the slightest bit of outcry about the darfur situation and there still has n't been anything said about other problems all over the continent but somehow this is different and a bunch of westerners have decided to complain .
what are you whining about ?
this goes on all over africa and all over the world and no one has so much has lifted a finger to stop it .
i think this is pre-g8 rhetorical rubbish .
daniel , birmingham , al , usa the uk and usa want a change in leadership in zimbabwe .
that 's why everything which zimbabwe did is bad for them .
in this case , they want to influence african leaders to be involved in a crackdown on zimbabwe .
michael henry magesa it really makes me smile when i read how outraged everyone is .
why ?
is this just not par for the course for this madman ?
this is happening all over africa today in varying degrees but nobody really cares because it 's black on black violence .
we here in south africa just watch all the leaders in africa float in and out of our country on their way to one or the other " summit " " meeting " or whatever that is going on at the moment .
african leaders love doing that - having " indabas " - get togethers to talk about aids or hiv or whatever .
they stay in 5 star hotels and shop until they drop - thinking that nobody notices anything .
and at the end of it all , they all face the west and say " gimme " " gimme " " gimme " .
if it was n't so tragic it would be laughable .
you think someone is going to care about stopping that insane , cruel man mr mugabe ?
naaah maybe when he has turned zimbabwe into ethiopia - maybe then .
but until the g8 start making africa accountable until they stop writing off debt and then just giving them more - nothing is going to change .
nadia strydom , cape town - south africa the south african government should use its influence to moderate mugabe 's paranoia nicolas canal , bogota , colombia that mugabe is a brutal dictator like hussein and kim jong il is something we already know .
what really strikes me is the attitude of south africa .
the south african government as the power broker in the region should use its influence to moderate mugabe 's paranoia .
instead , mbeki and the rest of the au sit and watch while yet another huge-scale human tragedy takes place in africa .
nicolas canal , bogota , colombia debt cancellation and aid only prop up these evil regimes .
p , south africa i am appalled both by the situation in zimbabwe and the reluctance of the other african nations to help put a stop to it .
we all too often hear that africa should be left to sort out its own problems without interference from ' colonial powers ' .
that would be fine if africa helped itself , but it never seems to .
jonny , uk it is sad that zimbabwe seemingly has gone to the dogs .
however , i agree with the au that africa has more serious problems that need to be tackled .
where is the uk and us when the au asks for more funds for the darfur crisis ?
what about congo ?
it seems that the uk and us only are doing what they are always good at - adopting a ' humanitarian ' policy only when it suits their interests .
kiazin , usa how can any leader justify what mugabe has done ?
simon , leicester , england this is another example that shows president mbeki is not competent enough to use his position of power to full effect .
his ignorance of mugabe ranks as high as his health departments ignorance of aids .
how can any leader justify what mugabe has done ?
whilst his people have become poorer with mass starvation , homelessness , unemployment , and poor health care , mugabe and his cronies have benefited by spending the much needed money on their own needs .
simon , leicester , england while the current demolitions are indeed very tragic , these types of demolitions occur all over the world to shanty town residents with little or no outcry from the international press .
even in the us we see public housing projects torn down for middle class condo 's while the poor have no place to go .
khalil tian shahyd , new orleans , louisiana the comments from the au makes my blood boil .
i see the people of zimbabwe toiling under great difficulty .
it 's high time the politicians of africa step up to the challenges of their wonderful continent .
they seem confused - blaming the west for interference on one hand , wanting handouts the next .
stop whinging and take some responsibility for the state of your countries .
richard , bath what is most frustrating as an african is seeing and hearing the so-called ' new generation ' of leaders making the same tired excuses for ignoring the outrageous behaviour of their peers .
africa needs strong leaders who understand the difference between right and wrong - treating people with humanity and without discrimination is right - treating them like they are less than human is a crime against every human in the world .
obe ownoko , london england is making a noise about nothing and it knows it .
can one just build a house in england without a permit or without paying for the land ?
let 's be realistic people .
bhinya , harare it 's a waste of time and effort calling on the clean-up operation to stop nhema , harare , zimbabwe the fact that the au and south africa have clearly told the west , led by britain and usa that they will not intervene in zimbabwe 's internal affairs should send signals to those powers that gone are the days when they dictated what africa should do .
it 's a waste of time and effort calling on the clean-up operation to stop since it is not going to stop .
instead the west should be offering solutions to the problem of lack of proper houses in the country if they really care as they purport .
nhema , harare , zimbabwe as expected the au still has its head in the sand .
as a regular contributor to the likes of comic relief -lrb- and i was at wembley 20 years ago -rrb- , i am sorry to have to say that i will not be giving any more of my cash to prop up a palpably inept and corrupt continent .
africa - heal thyself .
chris , manchester , uk maybe the african nations should stop blaming their own problems on 100 year old colonialism , stop foreign aid corruption that means the money gets spent on weapons to kill each other and start thinking about providing a decent standard of living for their own people .
scott , uk all of these calls for the us and uk to intervene , yet the african union -lrb- who along with the un , should have this responsibility -rrb- has decided that they wo n't get involved .
as a us soldier for over 20 years , i 'm sick and tired of being sent away from my family to " rescue " the rest of the world .
time for someone else to step up .
why do n't they give kofi annan or jacque chirac a call ?
stop calling tony and george .
mary , virginia , usa when will people stop playing the " there 's no oil in zimbabwe so no-one will help " card ?
it is churlish and lazy that people tout this phrase without any understanding of the workings of the zimbabwean economy .
the farming conditions in zimbabwe are -lrb- or rather were -rrb- second to none .
the country has had every opportunity as the most educated in africa , to relieve itself of this regime yet has stagnated due to inaction and lack of cohesion .
how about this ?
all those lucky enough to be given land in the reform , actually work together and farm it again .
properly ?
cole whitelaw , uk -lrb- formerly zimbabwe -rrb- these organisations do n't do anything .
the un will never come to the rescue of poor african countries f , mutare reading all the comments makes people like me laugh .
some are saying that the un or african union should do something .
the only thing they can do nowadays is make noise that they want debt cancellation to all developing countries .
look at what happened in sudan , rwanda and ivory coast .
these organisations do n't do anything .
the un will never come to the rescue of poor african countries .
rwanda is a good example of that .
zimbabweans have to die in millions before the world starts reacting .
f , mutare in the last two days the bbc ran a comparison between ghana and malaysia , and the differences were obvious , among them the street vendors and shack dwellings of ghana .
zimbabwe is not yet at that stage but was coming up fast .
question is , does the west take pride in reporting on unending seas of filth and disease in africa ?
is it wrong to set some standards of life ?
please stop this hypocrisy ?
compare what 's happening in zimbabwe and that in darfur , and the hypocrites stand out like a sore thump .
masimba , accra , ghana if you stayed in zimbabwe and had seen the way a lot of some those shacks had mushroomed , how the town had become filthy and unnecessarily crowded , you would understand tatts , harare i stay in harare so i am writing about what i know and see daily .
what is happening is both good and bad .
it is bad in the way and timing it has been executed .
if you stayed in zimbabwe and had seen the way a lot of some those shacks had mushroomed , how the town had become filthy and unnecessarily crowded , you would understand a thing or two before you opened your mouth to complain !
most of the people are complaining about what they do n't know about .
you go by what some reporter has written to sell his article .
right now the town is looking clean , you can move around without 10 people trying to sell you a watch you do n't need .
you can visit the shop of your choice without having to dodge three shacks just to get to the door !
people are being forced to renovate and make their buildings more presentable .
the two mistakes that i believe the government made on the housing demolitions was that they : did not give the people enough time to evacuate .
they should have at least told people a few months in advance !
and they did n't give the people a ready alternative .
the government talks of new housing schemes now .
they should have put the housing schemes in place first and then moved the people !
for your own information i have several close friends that have been affected and am praying and believing in god that i wo n't be asked to leave my place when they reach my area in a few days time .
but i still believe it was a necessary action but very bad timing and execution .
if nations are genuinely concerned let them help to build decent shelters and provide food rather than other pointless political suggestions !
tatts , harare i think the neighbouring countries and foreign groups should act immediately .
it is this operation and mr president that should driven away .
the world should act , as soon as possible as words are not solutions .
amanuel teka , asmara , eritrea i am deeply concerned with this situation as i am one of the victims .
i am now seeking refugee status in one of the neighbouring countries and i have left my family behind .
jasper masamba how much chaos and garbage is strewn all over in london and washington .
people argue that the displaced were earning a living ; from what ; were they adding any value to anything .
the situation as it was , was perpetuated poverty .
if the west wants to help they should resume the aid package to zimbabwe .
a recent unicef survey showed donors were giving the zimbabwean child 10 % of what every other child was getting in sadc .
zhara takarima , masvingo do n't you always hear them saying no interference in internal matters of other states ?
kapinga ntumba , harare why ca n't we be realistic ?
how can condoleezza and straw expect to see the so-called african leaders take strong action against the regime in zimbabwe when they are also doing the same thing to their people but in other forms ?
do n't you always hear them saying no interference in internal matters of other states ?
that 's how they cover up themselves .
the operation on its own was not too bad , if well planned .
the same way they jumped into the agrarian reform without taking precautionary measures that 's how they 've also done with this operation .
i am personally grateful to the human groups that are sympathetic the plight of the people of zimbabwe .
kapinga ntumba , harare , zimbabwe it is actually inhuman for the zimbabwe government to destroy hundreds of houses although i do recognise that most of them are illegal structures .
instead a solution should have been found , such us compensating them and allocating new plots , so that they can build decent houses .
wycliff mulenga , lusaka , zambia it is this culture of ' you support me , i reward you ' that is a great threat to our democracy in africa cecilia chisale , malawi it is very inhuman for mugabe 's administration to be saying these demolitions are restoring sanity .
it is this culture of ' you support me , i reward you ' that is a great threat to our democracy in africa .
i feel mugabe wants to make those who did not vote for him in the urban areas suffer the consequences .
this is somehow similar to events happening to malawi at present where the president is suffering because of this culture .
typical of africa .
i feel the foreign groups should intervene in zimbabwe .
cecilia chisale , malawi the city does need a clean up ... yes .
however about 80 % of the people that are suffering are innocent .
not all structures are found in squatter camps .
most are decent liveable structures which are helping to alleviate homelessness .
in a country with a high rate on unemployment who can afford to build better homes .
not only are they destroying the structures but a person 's belongings in the structure .
please zimbabwe needs your help and intervention !
we live each day never knowing if we 'll be next .
we have no where else to go .
lyke , zimbabwe this crackdown is a clear shot at the opposition with a veiled attempt at calling it operation clean up rubbish .
why has the government resorted to making people homeless during its darkest economic hour ?
no logic is evident and it is of great concern that south africa continues to keep the country functioning without any voice on the humanitarian crisis that has precipitated .
malcolm , georgetown , guyana forget all your favourite shows on tv ; just watch the african union for comedy .
apparently they have " more important things to deal with than zimbabwe " .
possibly - darfur and drc .
maybe i 'm missing something , but the au is n't doing anything about either of those .
they simply have meetings and discuss .
and do nothing .
they stated a few years that they wish to build an african union just like the europeans built the eu .
-lrb- refer to my previous comment about comedy . -rrb-
the west should stop all funding to this wasteful , pointless , corrupt organisation .
if the au continues the way it seems to be going , it will soon be as relevant as the un .
ds , london , uk look at the hypocrisy .
many houses are being demolished in iraq by the superpowers everyday .
no-one cries foul .
zimbabwe destroys illegal houses , no bombs dropped and the western powers cry foul .
am i missing something here ?
why are the parts not adding up ?
mubangi abel , uk i find it incredibly annoying how people who are n't zimbabwean are saying how what is happening is good but just being done in the wrong way .
unless one has been there one will not know the extent to which this problem is .
the situation is beyond terrible with most of country homeless and starving .
un intervention is required !
why is it that international agencies only go in when situations become detrimental ?
the international world needs to go into zimbabwe and make a change , this country is in desperate need of help , with everyone turning a blind eye !
tafadzwa , london everybody is making noise simply because it is mugabe again akouwa , lome let us for once stop this hypocrisy .
everybody is making noise simply because it is mugabe again .
worse things than these are happening in togo where people are being kidnapped at night and killed secretly .
the whole world pretends not to know this .
children like the one who by accident was killed during the demolition in zimbabwe die everyday in iraq .
in nigeria many years ago maroko was demolished and a lot of people died .
nobody said a thing and the area was divided among high ranking army officials and their acolytes .
even recently in ghana there were such demolitions of illegal structures as well as in abuja and all the major cities in nigeria .
america and europe should get off mugabe 's back and stop their hypocrisies .
akouwa , lome , togo zesa -lrb- zimbabwe electricity supply authority -rrb- holdings , an electricity distribution parastatal , had anticipated a huge shortfall of electricity supplies during this winter and had actually warned of load-shedding of up to three hours per day during peak hours .
now that these illegal dwellings have demolished such plans have been shelved because the limited electricity supply is now adequate .
it proves that these demolished shacks had been drawing electricity illegally without paying .
jack straw does not live here .
we do and we are seeing the benefits .
shupai darare , harare , zimbabwe how is this talking at the g8 going to help the thousands homeless in winter in zimbabwe tonight ?
peter ross , harare what use is aid or writing off african debts when leaders like president mugabe demolish homes and businesses and farms .
the g8 should help sort zimbabwe out first before talking about africa .
how is this talking at the g8 going to help the thousands homeless in winter in zimbabwe tonight ?
even aid agencies are banned in zimbabwe not to mention the foreign press .
it 's time mr blair and mr bush started tackling dictators first even if they do n't have oil .
if you give a man a fishing rod he can feed his family but if the president breaks it they have nothing .
if no-one stops that president are they not permitting or tolerating that behaviour ?
peter ross , harare , zimbabwe what we see is the beginning of the end of the regime of mugabe and his cohorts .
the suffering ordinary people will go through will depend on the degree and speed of international intervention .
south africa should take the lead and act now .
gerhard , suva , fiji it 's a global disgrace that the world has allowed mugabe to do what he has done to the people of zimbabwe in the last week or so .
the world 's leaders should stand condemned .
julie keast , newcastle , australia intervention is a must right now because 200,000 people are homeless thanks to mugabe 's " restoring sanity " campaign .
external pressure from everyone including the un , african union , his neighbours and his few allies is greatly needed .
if mugabe wants to " restore sanity " in the urban areas , he should provide a plot of land for these people to build new homes and lives .
the people are helpless and fearful to rise against mugabe because he has installed a sense of fear amongst the zimbabweans and yet the world is just watching from afar .
firdaus , singapore it is truly unfortunate , not to mention tragic , that in his waning days , president mugabe would unleash the wrath of his dying regime on the poor and disenfranchise people of zimbabwe .
even wholesale condemnation of these heinous acts by a regime in the throes of death by the international community will not suffice .
want it or not , the international community should take decisive action , including military intervention , to stem the tide of the suffering unfolding in zimbabwe .
phlson victor , stroudsburg , pa , usa the timing of this could n't be more relevant to the g8 meeting andrew , thailand -lrb- ex zim -rrb- the timing of this could n't be more relevant to the g8 meeting this week in which further discussions to cancel debt to african nations is taking place .
here is a leader who has single-handedly bankrupted one of africa 's most prosperous countries in less than five years and when more than 80 % are unemployed and desperately seeking income from the informal sector he 's busy making life even more miserable for them .
this is the real reason why africa is poor .
with people like this in charge of african countries no amount of aid or debt relief is going to significantly change their futures .
yes , for the sake of humanity , outsiders should intervene .
the g8 countries would do better to impose harsh conditions on the african union to encourage them to pursue justice among their own .
andrew , thailand -lrb- ex zim -rrb- what a shame that the so-called leaders of other african countries are silent .
les wilson , london the time has come for the international community to refer zimbabwe to the un security council for action .
time is up for this african tyrant .
patrick tum , prague , czech republic those whose comments here suggest that it 's perfectly normal for this operation ' drive out the rubbish ' to take place , and that the uk or us would n't tolerate ' illegal ' structures either , are completely naive to the real africa .
africa is poor , there are n't enough jobs , people flock to the cities , there is n't enough housing , millions of africans live in squatter camps and illegal settlements all over the continent .
this is normal .
they are resourceful survivors , they join the informal sector and set up as street side vendors , they probably have to bribe the police to do this , but they find a way because their governments can offer them little .
in zimbabwe 's case they are there simply trying to feed themselves and there is a thriving black market because of systematic mis-management and ill-doctrine from the zimbabwe government .
when people are living on the breadline and then you take this away from them simply to ' clean things up ' you are committing a grave human rights violation .
the uk and us would provide social relief before evicting anyone .
jane , zimbabwean in uk why has it taken 25 years to pull down these illegal structures ?
rossco , auckland this man has split families and as long as the rest of the world watches he will carry on doing as he pleases .
one question comes to mind " why has it taken 25 years to pull down these illegal structures ?
when i was living in bulawayo and harare theses structures where there and did n't seem to bother any one .
i believe this man wants the people to riot so that he can then impose martial law so as to have a free reign to do what he wants when he wants .
rossco , auckland new zealand what on earth is quiet diplomacy ?
it should be called what it really is - fear of conflict , lack of excellence , or just pure slackness .
part or the course in africa .
god forbid that i should raise my children by " quiet diplomacy " - they 'd be in prison before they made it to university ...
george eastland , auckland , nz i fail to understand why people are blaming mugabe for his evident madness .
this is a tragedy purely of mbeki 's making ; he could have brought this tyrant 's reign to an end long before now if he was minded to do so .
and yet what do we see ?
the red carpet at yet another g8 summit !
who says the west is not complicit in our misery ?
ue , kent , uk / nigeria to ue of kent : you accuse mbeki , excuse mugabe and then somehow the west is responsible .
african brothers and sisters wake - " when plantain don rot , make una no pretend say e de ripe .
wetin no good , no good ; talk am clear , talk am loud " .
african leaders have shirked their responsibility and have the blood of the dead from the cleanup on their hands .
mbeki , obasanjo , speak up , citizens of africa ...
speak up .
adesina olugbenga , london / nigeria mugabe is doing the right thing but in the traditionally brutal african way .
the campaign is doing just what it says : driving out the rubbish , the open-sewage , and garbage-strewn squatters ' camps which are schools and havens for criminals .
these people all came from the country to make an easy buck any way they can and have turned these cities into trash .
i wish brazil would do the same in sao paulo and rio de janeiro .
jeremy , atlanta , usa they should intervene by providing huge sums of money to help these people build decent homes with water , electricity and toilets gerald mwaanga , chicago yes , they should intervene by providing huge sums of money to help these people build decent homes with water , electricity and toilets .
i am a little surprised or is it confused by all the brouhaha , obviously , these people have lived in shacks for a number of years , why is it that the international groups did not help then ?
which neighbouring country would have the resources to help ?
zambia ?
south africa or is it botswana ?
unless by intervention you mean bombing harare to a pulp , in which case , britain , as the country with the best knowledge of the terrain and state of the art firing power should take the lead .
after the tsunami in south east asia the bbc did not take polls like this , asking people whether they wish to help .
you simply directed people where to send money .
to me they both look like humanitarian issues .
am i missing something here ?
gerald mwaanga , chicago , usa a lot of hand wringing here but when someone actually did something to stop saddam hussein and his gang of baathist thugs , half the world went ballistic .
remember saddam hussein ?
most of this outcry is just for show .
the majority of complainers do n't really want anything done or they would be down at the un marching and begging donald rumsfeld to spare a division or two for a few weeks to put this guy out of business .
mark , usa why do n't bush and blair think of a regime change in zimbabwe ?
is it because there is no oil to exploit ?
is preaching of democracy and freedom only for middle east ?
sh moulana , colombo , sri lanka this operation is an outrage .
the international community should get involved and do whatever it can to stop this and make reparations to the victims .
brenda erickson , st paul , usa us should stop preaching about human rights etc when they themselves are just as guilty .
they have lost respect in this world .
double standards by western nations is not going to do any good .
what is needed is a solid intervention by non-western governments , mainly developing countries which are far more influential and respected , in dealing with zimbabwe .
also then it will mean that mugabe can not point a finger at western interference .
kay , uk we , zimbabweans will keep on suffering in the hand of mugabe , people will continue to starve and lose their homes .
who would want to intervene anyway ?
zimbabwe does not have the riches the world so called desires for example oil .
this has been going on for a very long time and nobody has intervened .
and yes i am very much affected by these demolitions - who is going to house and feed our people now ?
who will and would intervene - nobody .
this is insane .
paula , uk this is insanity !
when a government makes a decision about its own country it has the right to do so !
he is not killing people say like the us and britain are in iraq .
these two countries have no place in the moral high ground game .
i thank african leaders for not bowing to imperialist pressure !
yonathan , los angeles , ca , united states it is another interesting test of the relevance of the un and its ability to get things done .
who are the men and women that run the un ?
where do these ineffectual politicians come from ?
maybe bush should cook up another spurious reason for regime change and go for mugabe .
duncan , reading , uk these people that the west is so concerned about were living in plastic anyway munya , usa -lrb- zimbabwean -rrb- these people that the west is so concerned about were living in plastic anyway .
they were living in unauthorized areas which would not be permissible in the west .
if the west is so concerned about these people , why have they not helped similar people living in shanty towns all over africa ?
how would you feel if ten of these people came and built their houses outside and just next to your well built house ?
for whatever reason , mugabe is doing a great job to rid the cities of criminal activities .
munya , st louis , usa -lrb- zimbabwean -rrb- why should they ?
does the eu intervene every time the british government makes the gypsies or travellers move ?
mutongwinjo muchamama , slough , uk zimbabweans have suffered enough with no respite .
where is the international community ?
as for mbeki , zimbabweans will certainly not ever forget him .
ndabezinhle moyo , london if neighbouring countries had intervened earlier , the destruction of people 's homes and lives would have been avoided .
it is so sad that it has taken this long for them to realise how cruel mugabe and his police have become .
keith farquharson , london this is complete insanity .
leaving these people homeless is almost putting them to death .
then preventing them from growing food ?
the world is asleep .
