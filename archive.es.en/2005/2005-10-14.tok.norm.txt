not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .
a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .

in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .

to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision .

but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said .

" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .

many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .

franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .
schäuble , wheelchair-bound after an attempt on his life in 1990 , is well-respected and would be a trusted hand in a government short on experience at national level . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court . " we plan to fight back with all the legal and journalistic means at our disposal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister faces questions on magazine raid germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court . " we plan to fight back with all the legal and journalistic means at our disposal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister faces questions on magazine raid germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .

a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .

many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .

franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .

in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .

to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .

but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said .

many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .
rumors abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber is set to take over the economy ministry günther öttinger , the state premier of baden-württemberg , said : " some ministries are still in the air , others are foreseeable .

franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .
the organization confirmed it was not changing its alert level for a pandemic . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2005 germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , ströbele has a cult following with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s . after announcing he 'd be retiring to the back-benches after the recent elections , incumbent foreign minister joschka fischer gave an interview declaring he was the last rock ' n ' roller in german politics .
many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .

" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .

in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .

to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .

their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .

to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .

-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it .

their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .

" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .

" schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

" schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court .

many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .
rumors abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber is set to take over the economy ministry günther öttinger , the state premier of baden-württemberg , said : " some ministries are still in the air , others are foreseeable .

franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .

" the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .

the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .

he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .

" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .
the organization confirmed it was not changing its alert level for a pandemic . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .

in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .

it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision .

" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .

he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .

" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2005 merkel seeks strong allies for cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel faces tough times without strong support in the cabinet germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel huddled with party leaders on friday seeking big-hitting conservative ministers able to hold their own against coalition partners loyal to gerhard schröder . the deal which saw merkel land the job of chancellor and oust schröder came at the price of handing eight ministries , including key roles , to the outgoing chancellor 's social democrats . the names of the new social democratic ministers were announced on thursday , including a powerful former state premier , peer steinbrück , at the finance ministry and a trusted schröder lieutenant , frank-walter steinmeier , as foreign minister . the conservatives are expected on monday , ahead of the start of negotiations to hammer out the government 's program , to announce who will fill their six cabinet posts : at economy , interior , defense , agriculture , education and family , as well as the speaker 's chair .
many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .
rumors abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber is set to take over the economy ministry günther öttinger , the state premier of baden-württemberg , said : " some ministries are still in the air , others are foreseeable . " the only job announced so far is the economy minister , with the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , taking the job . other names tipped to take the conservatives ' big jobs are lesser known outside germany .
franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .
schäuble , wheelchair-bound after an attempt on his life in 1990 , is well-respected and would be a trusted hand in a government short on experience at national level . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles .

many posts would only be decided until the party 's leadership had completed discussions set to stretch into the weekend , officials said .
rumors abound bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber is set to take over the economy ministry günther öttinger , the state premier of baden-württemberg , said : " some ministries are still in the air , others are foreseeable . " the only job announced so far is the economy minister , with the conservative leader of the powerful state of bavaria , edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , taking the job . other names tipped to take the conservatives ' big jobs are lesser known outside germany .
franz josef jung , a leading member of the christian democratic government in the state of hesse , which includes germany 's financial hub of frankfurt , is rumored to be in line for the job as defense minister .
jung is considered to be a versatile politician but , like steinmeier , has little international profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble the interior ministry however looks destined for the familiar face of wolfgang schäuble , a confidant of conservative former chancellor helmut kohl and who previously held the job from 1989 to 1991 .
schäuble , wheelchair-bound after an attempt on his life in 1990 , is well-respected and would be a trusted hand in a government short on experience at national level . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .
the organization confirmed it was not changing its alert level for a pandemic . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .
the organization confirmed it was not changing its alert level for a pandemic . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court .

pharmacies have reported that the demand for tamiflu , in particular , the prescription-only medicine recommended by the who and the european union to treat eventual infections , has surged . " the demand was extremely high in recent weeks , " christiane eckert-lill of german national pharmacy association abda said on thursday .
in august alone , 79,000 packages of tamiflu were sold .
the same time last year only around 900 packages had been sold , she said . swiss pharmaceutical company roche , which makes tamiflu , has seen its share price rise to an all-time high as the news broke that avian flu had been detected in romania . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a veterinary expert disinfects the area where slaughtered chickens were buried in the village of kiziksa , western turkey germany 's farmers ' association have accused the government of not taking the threat of bird flu seriously enough since the virus was detected in poultry in turkey and romania .
the farmers say poultry owners should be required to keep their birds in stalls to prevent the virus from infecting wild fowl .
policing the country 's borders and points of entry , which the national task force decided thursday , was not enough , they said .
assuaging fears but interim consumer affairs and agriculture minister jürgen trittin said the risk is " low to moderate " that migratory birds will carry the virus to germany , since at this time of year they are flying south for the winter .
he said that illegal animal transports and travelers posed the greatest danger , which was why the government has singled out more intensive border controls , at airports too , to prevent the spread .
trittin was backed up by the national research institute for animal health , the friedrich loeffler institute , which said on friday that there was still no need to confine poultry to stalls , even if the romanian cases were confirmed to have been infected with the more aggressive h5n1 strain of the virus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german poultry farmers have no stalls to confine their animals if they are required to do so the european commission is expected to announce on saturday whether the birds in romania were infected by the h5n1 strain or a weaker one .
on thursday the eu confirmed that h5n1 had been found in the turkish samples . germany 's robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- warned that people should not dramatize the situation .
" we mus n't be afraid , " rki chief reinhard kurth said thursday on public television station ard .
though the more the virus spreads , the greater the risk that the aggressive h5n1 strain could mutate into a virus more dangerous to humans , it remains so far a disease restricted to animals , he explained .
" that 's why we should remain relatively relaxed , which does not mean inattentive . " who alarm level stable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farmers are on the alert the world health organization also tired to assure people .
" we are not in the presence of a human pandemic and the fact that the h5n1 virus has arrived at europe 's doors does not mean that we need a change in strategy , " roberto bertollini , head of the european branch of the world health organization , said in a press conference in rome on thursday . in geneva , the who issued a statement on the spread of the virus to turkey and romania , noting that , " all evidence to date indicates that the h5n1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans . "
it added that people who have fallen ill after possible contact with infected birds should be monitored , but that because the initial symptoms of the avian flu virus were similar to those of the common flu , false alarms were likely .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court . " we plan to fight back with all the legal and journalistic means at our disposal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister faces questions on magazine raid germany 's interior minister has been asked to explain why police searched a journalist 's home and his magazine 's office in raids .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .
schily insisted the state had a right to defend itself against breaches of state secrecy . a former radical lawyer for the raf terrorists in the 1970s who once argued that violence against the west german state was justifiable " resistance against the auschwitz generation , " schily managed to appease his critics thursday , admitting he had adopted the wrong tone in the matter and stressing that he had never personally ordered the search , pointing out the order did not come from his ministry but from potsdam 's public prosecution . he told the committee that his involvement had been " indirect , " and all he did was approve an investigation - a " formal procedure " required of his office in cases of suspected breaches of state secrecy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer observers say that with his appearance before the committee , schily has managed to avert further controversy .
but cicero 's editor-in-chief wolfram weimer says the affair is far from over , announcing thursday that the magazine may yet be turning to germany 's constitutional court .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- president werner hackmann said friday they have requested an urgent meeting with klinsmann when he returns to germany in ten days ' time .
this follows the failure to set up a meeting after germany 's international friendly win against china in hamburg midweek , as it did not suit some top flight coaches .
schalke 04 manager rudi assauer complained : " someone absolutely has to talk with jürgen klinsmann .
there are a lot of grumbles in the bundesliga .
instead of taking the time to see how each -lrb- club -rrb- coach is working , he has already flown back to the united states . "
officials from both schalke 04 and bayern munich can not understand why klinsmann did not wait until sunday to observe several internationals in action when the teams play each other at gelsenkirchen .
germany is hosting the world cup finals next june , and some feel that klinsmann 's insistence on living in california while working as the national coach is damaging their chances of success . dw-world.de jeers not cheers as germany beat china world cup hosts germany defeated china 1-0 in a friendly match in front of a stadium full of disgruntled fans in hamburg on wednesday .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

not much is known about the " silent star in schröder 's team , " who largely acted behind the scenes . for someone who has preferred a low profile to the political spotlight , frank-walter steinmeier will have to get used to playing one of the most visible roles in german politics . the 49-year-old , who is a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder and his chief of staff since 1999 , was nominated this week to fill the key foreign ministry post in the new power-sharing cabinet of the social democrats and the conservatives . the reaction to steinmeier 's nomination , expected by few , has caused some bewilderment in germany . " who actually is steinmeier ? " ran a headline on friday 's handelsblatt daily , reflecting the fact that the white-haired steinmeier is a relative unknown to those outside of political circles . " dr flawless " steinmeier is rumored to be friendly yet firm and a smooth behind-the-scenes operator .
the newspaper die woche once described him as a " silent star of the schröder team . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , extreme right , during a meeting of schröder 's cabinet indeed , he 's been an indispensable aide to schröder during the last seven years , both regarding foreign policy and domestic issues .
he has earned a reputation as an efficient manager and tireless worker . he was also valued as a reliable mediator in schröder 's cabinet when it came to sticky political issues , able to defuse spats and personal tensions . that led the respected german weekly die zeit to dub steinmeier " dr. flawless " and others to call him " chancellor whisperer " in a reference to steinmeier 's familiar presence to schröder 's left at high-ranking meetings and conferences , passing him slips of paper or murmuring words of advice into his ear . steinmeier 's squeaky-clean record has also reputedly left the opposition at a loss to find anything negative about him . " i find him really efficient and i think he 's perfect for every post , " michael glos , a top politician of the conservative christian social union , told deutsche welle . continuing schröder 's course ? the son of a carpenter , steinmeier was born in the western german town of detmold on jan .
5 , 1946 .
he 's married and has an eight-year-old daughter . the law graduate has been a member of the social democratic party for the last 29 years and at schröder 's side since the chancellor 's days as premier of the state of lower saxony in the 1990s . head of the federal chancellery since july 1999 , he has been closely involved in coordination with intelligence services .
steinmeier is said to be particularly interested in the middle east as well as the international fight against terrorism . he took part in daily briefings with schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer in the aftermath of the sept .
11 attacks and is said to have been schröder 's closest advisor in the run-up to his famous refusal to participate in the us-led war against iraq . though steinmeier is largely considered to have little direct foreign policy experience , his one memorable speech on foreign affairs does indicate that he might largely continue the course taken by schröder . at a meeting held at berlin 's science and politics foundation last month , where he filled in for schröder , steinmeier championed the policy of seeking a more active role for germany on the international stage , gradually taking on more responsibility after the reticence that followed world war two . tough act to follow however , the job of being germany 's face abroad wo n't be an easy one for steinmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing foreign minister joschka fischer the expectations will be high as he attempts to fill in the large shoes of his predecessor , the highly popular and charismatic joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- . and steinmeier will also need plenty of diplomatic finesse and artful negotiation skills in handling ties with washington .

according to blatter , a number of clubs increasingly operate what he called a form of " wild west capitalism , " an approach he said undermined the essence of soccer and resulted in a glaring discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots .
" many clubs are obliged to fight tooth and nail for their livelihoods while other luckier ones can afford nuclear warheads they 're so well-off , " he said .

the silver lining in press tampering case report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis current affairs -pipe- 14.10.2005 schily on the defensive in cicero affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after his committee appearance , schily feels he 's silenced his critics outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff . in the two-hour hearing on thursday , schily angrily rejected the criticism he " behaved in a totalitarian manner , " an accusation he said was based on " misquoted statements . " schily unleashed the wrath of german publishing houses as well as parliamentarians across the political spectrum when he approved raids on cicero 's offices and the home of a member of its staff in response to an article quoting federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- documents meant only for internal purposes and classified as " secret . " press freedom no excuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cicero 's summer edition ever since the september raids took place , schily has maintained they were in keeping with correct procedure and that freedom of the press in the country " does not justify breaking the law . "
publishers , meanwhile , described the raids as press harassment . schily reiterated his belief thursday that press freedom and the fight on terror were no excuse for a journalist to breach the law by publishing classified documents . " the principle of source protection does not hold for criminals , " he said . " freedom of the press is not questioned when investigative journalism unearths scandals , " said schily recently .
" but that does not mean that every classified state document should be made available to journalists . " " the majority of the committee made it clear that they take a different view of this matter to otto schily , " said one committee member . bka suspect leak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al-zarqawi the offending article by bruno scirra about the jordanian terrorist abu musab-al-sarkawi -lrb- photo -rrb- had prompted police to search cicero 's offices and schirra 's home , copying his hard drive and confiscating 15 boxes of documents , in a move believed to have been ordered by schily himself schirra had used a leaked bka document as one of his sources for the story , and critics say the office masterminded the cicero raid in order to identify who was responsible for the leak , believing the guilty party to be someone from its own ranks .
in fact , its official reason for the raids was to establish whether schirra was an accessory to betrayal of state secrets . appeasing the critics however , the raid inevitably unearthed documents with no bearing on the case , and press and politicians alike were quick to protest .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said . " but it was a revolutionary movement that set out to bridge the gap between rich and poor and demolish the power of the banks and corporations , " he explained .
" clearly , it failed in this mission , but what it did do was transform germany 's entire value system .
it might have failed in its main objectives , but the changes it swept along with it have become part and parcel of german life . " optimistic even though today 's younger generation is broadly dismissed as empty-headed and apolitical , ströbele has faith they still have a social conscience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations against the iraq war " even in 1968 , the students who took to the streets were only ever a minority , " he said .
" when i talk to young people today i recognize a lot of the same basic criticisms against society and the world order that we had back then .
and compare the demonstrations against the vietnam war with the protests against the us-led strike on iraq in 2003 - there were ten times as many people this time round .
there 's a different approach these days , people are political in different ways , they 're less theoretical and less radical . but to say that people have become depoliticized is to misrepresent history . " and as for those who accuse the 68ers of triggering social destitution with their anti-authoritarian child-rearing , free love , communes and drug-taking - ströbele 's having none of it . " without a doubt , the neo-conservatives have contributed far more to a decline in values and the fact that a lot of young people think life is about consumer consumption and having fun , " he insisted .
" the 68ers took their political and social responsibilities very seriously , unlike many conservatives .

many believe that particular distinction actually belongs to another green party stalwart , hans-christian ströbele .
both popular with younger voters , they 've also both long vyed for the role of green party 's moral backbone . but ströbele plays down the rivalry .
" i feel that the contrast to joschka fischer was just an idea pushed by the media , " he said .
" the people who vote for me do tend to be very young .
my support base includes over 50 percent of the under-25s .
they vote for me because i represent integrity and i never make promises i ca n't keep . "
bildunterschrift : joschka fischer 's streetfighting days he was also considerably further on the margins of mainstream germany than fischer ever was , despite his famous street-fighting past -lrb- photo -rrb- . in the early 1970s ströbele was among the lawyers set to defend the baader-meinhof terrorist group at the stammheim trial in stuttgart , only to be excluded from the courtroom in 1975 , accused of complicity with the terrorists .
in 1977 he was one of the founding members of berlin 's left-wing daily tageszeitung , and today , he 's a member of the bundestag - and a fervent champion of 1968-style idealism .
in 2002 , he was the first green party politician to be directly elected to parliament , and successfully defended his seat on sept .
18 this year , despite the sharp drop in the green party 's popularity across germany .
a missed opportunity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr troops in afghanistan he has mixed feelings about the end of schröder 's government .
to the green party 's more fundamentalist base , it never quite went the distance .
it might have negotiated phasing out nuclear energy and pushing up tax on petrol , but the much-touted reform of the citizenship laws , for example , ended up seriously diluted - while ströbele was one of the only politicians to insist germany remain staunchly pacifist in regard to international conflicts . " the red-green coalition definitely made some progress , but there was a limit to what it was willing to do , " he said .
" personally i was very disappointed , i had very different expectations .
but basically it was n't a coalition of 68ers , it was a coalition between the greens and the social democrats , and the latter in particular have principles that are very far removed from the 68er vision . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele " i always looked for the people in government and parliament who supposedly belonged to the 68er generation , " he went on .
" gerd schröder was never a 68er , even though the media was always trying to attach that label to him .
-lrb- interior minister -rrb- otto schily was maybe a marginal figure , but he definitely was n't one of the demonstrators out on the streets .
these people did n't really belong to that scene , but they were heavily influenced by it . " the 68er legacy disappointing it may have been to an avowed leftist , but germany 's government over the last 7 years was probably the first and last time the 68er generation had an opportunity to effect lasting change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : student riots in 1968 thirty years after students took to the streets in protests across europe , the former firebrands are now slowly reaching retirement age .
their chance to make a difference is almost over .
but according to ströbele , their influence ca n't be underestimated . " it 's not that society is moving away from the values of the 68er generation , but the people who upheld them are slowly leaving the public stage , " he said .
" the values remain , and these days , they 've infiltrated all corners of society . back then , people fought very hard to achieve a lot of things that are now taken for granted . " confronting the nazi past and liberalizing a country steeped in 1950s conservatism was no mean feat .
" back then , germany was basically still run by former nazis , even if people never said so out loud , " explained ströbele .
" my teachers were all nazis .
and when young people realized this , it led to a radical rejection of the society of their parents . " the more extreme objectives of the 68er rebellion were never achieved , and ströbele admits mistakes were made .
" our idea that we could usher in a revolution in germany by dispensing with parliamentary democracy and introducing a completely different social order - we favored a soviet-style republic or grass-roots democracy - proved to be an illusion , " he said .

the acclaimed film director has agreed to develop three original games with ea 's los angeles studios .
work has already started on the first of the three projects , which ea says will be a next generation game which appeals to a broad audience .
the deal is a further sign of how hollywood and the games industry are moving closer together .
earlier this month , another oscar-winning director , peter jackson , signed up to work on movie version of the best-selling sci-fi shooter halo .
jackson , whose latest project is king kong , has also been closely involved in the game version of the giant ape film .
creative force spielberg , 58 , has made blockbuster movies such as et , close encounters of the third kind and raiders of the lost ark .
the oscar-winning director is said to be a passionate and avid gamer .
you can expect it to be something that appeals to a broad audience neil young , ea los angeles studios for his work with ea , spielberg will have an office at the company 's la studios to work side-by-side with the game developers .
spielberg 's role will be similar to that of an executive producer on a film .
the aim of the deal is to create three original games , rather than a title based on a movie .
" having watched the game industry grow from a niche into a major creative force in entertainment , i have a great deal of respect for ea 's understanding of the interactive format , " said spielberg .
the games under development will take advantage of new technology in upcoming gaming consoles , which offer powerful processing power and more realistic graphics .
" no one is more at the centre of understanding gameplay and great storytelling than steven spielberg , " the head of ea 's la studios , neil young , told the bbc news website .
" being able to draw from steven spielberg 's experience in crafting incredible stories and combine that with our view of interactivity means you will have richer fiction , deeper characters and better sense of immersion . "
work has already started on the first of the three games .
electronic arts has not released details of the project , but young suggested it would take a couple of years to finish the game .
" you can expect it to be something that appeals to a broad audience , " he said .
ea will own the intellectual properties on the games and will develop , publish and distribute them worldwide .
spielberg 's dreamworks had produced games for a time under its dreamworks interactive division , but ea bought it in 2000 .

former prime minister baroness thatcher is celebrating her 80th birthday .
the queen and duke of edinburgh , as well as prime minister tony blair , will be among 650 guests attending a party in london .
as britain 's longest serving conservative prime minister , margaret thatcher 's influence can still be felt in politics and society .
what are your thoughts as baroness thatcher celebrates her 80th birthday .
how has she influenced politics in the uk ?
this debate is now closed .
please read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by les , morpeth , northumberland , uk will you be wishing margaret thatcher a happy birthday ?
what are your memories of her time as prime minister ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates thatcher 's rule was like the curate 's egg ' good in parts ' .
while necessary reforms to both the economic and social spheres of britain were carried out by her administration in the 80s , she stayed too long and her autocratic style eventually led to her downfall .
it is necessary to have a consensus approach to government for it to work and her confrontational style , brokering no criticism of her decisions , led to deep divisions , not only in the country as a whole but in the conservative party itself .
personally , i think she was all style without much lasting substance .
colin cumner , adelaide , south australia the greatest political leader in europe with churchill and de gaulle .
france is today a declining country as was uk in the 70s .
we need a thatcher today ...
with admiration from paris cheers jean-pierre dumas , france ironically mrs. thatcher 's complete destruction of old labour has made the conservatives unelectable as new labour have stolen all their policies .
jonathan michaud , baltimore , md , usa -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- she was a political visionary and a stoical leader , the best post-war leader of them all .
in 1979 , she took power of a broken , strike-ridden and bankrupt country .
i was only 8 but i remember doing homework by candlelight !
she was opposed at every turn by the very politicians now in power and they are imitating her policies .
her vision was spot-on , thanks to the destruction of socialism , we have a vibrant economy and we are better off .
sure , the medicine did n't taste good but the sick man of europe is very much fit again and envied in europe .
happy birthday mrs. t and many more .
mike , london , uk scotland 's north sea oil , not thatcher , is what injected wealth into the uk economy after the ' 70s , not to mention all the states assets that were sold of to benefit the few , and frittered away .
now the oil is running out and we have nothing to show for it .
thanks a lot thatcher !
michael , glasgow , scotland her most impressive achievement was to totally destroy old labour , their policies and politics .
for that we owe her a great debt .
ian , whitwick , england she was definitely influential - a short list of her influences would include ; selling off council houses which has contributed to the housing shortage and the rocketing prices of the past 20 years .
selling off public services , this led to a dangerous and bankrupt railway , dirty hospital and unhealthy school meals .
selling off bt , which created a private monopoly , still largely intact .
the great shareholding , home owning was a mirage .
matt munro , bristol , uk maggie was the greatest ruler of my time .
if it were n't for her then our country would be stuck in the union lead era of discontent .
happy birthday maggie !
james , bristol whilst implementing overdue union reform , she threw the poor in this country to the wolves , unleashed an era of greed epitomised by former ministers ending up on the boards of utilities they helped privatise , broke records for unemployment , doubled vat destroyed the coal-mining towns and brought in the poll tax .
the only time she cried in public was the day she finally left number 10 downing street .
her true legacy is the tories are still unelectable today .
t , london maggie is a great woman .
she brought the uk up from the gutter and made it into a credible country .
i 'm fascinated by all the prattle about public transport and the like on this forum .
do those contributors forget that labour have had many years to do something about it all but have failed miserably ?
giuseppe , barnsley , uk her legacy is tony blair simon barb , paris her legacy is tony blair and three - probably four and maybe five or more labour victories at the general election .
it may indeed be that the conservative party -lrb- as she knew it -rrb- never again takes office in its own right .
many of her actions at the time were " right " - but the damage she did to the uk 's international standing - particularly with regard to europe - was terrible .
her economic record is mixed - presiding over horrific interest rates , massive unemployment , woeful underinvestment in public services and terrible social disharmony .
simon barb , paris , france thatcher is without question one of the greatest prime ministers of recent times .
after the debacle created by labour that was the ' 70s she courageously took the drastically necessary steps to restore britain to fore on the world stage - both economically , politically and socially .
she is a remarkable woman - whether you like or dislike her - we today enjoy the benefits of her courageous leadership of this country .
she is to be thanked for what she did for britain .
chris j , london when she was in power the rich got richer and the poor got poorer .
her privatisation policies had disastrous consequences for public transport and many other key services that should never have been sold off to make a quick buck .
her many disillusioned fans will probably always be too short sighted to see the damage she did to this country when she was in power .
peter h , edinburgh , scotland margaret thatcher has changed the way as a nation we think of ourselves christopher , basingstoke margaret thatcher has changed the way as a nation we think of ourselves , through such historical moments as the falkland conflict , the miners ' strike , etc .
her legacy is one that saw britain transformed from the sick man of europe with nurses , doctors , teachers , firemen , bakers , etc on strike .
christopher , basingstoke brilliant leader .
such a shame that the selfish few can not see that certain industries are not sustainable , especially when we do not have any comparative advantage in the global economy that exists .
the country was in ruins and we have her to thank for the economic situation we now reside in .
how quick people forget the turmoil the country was in before she took over .
we have gone from third world to first thanks to thatcher .
have a great birthday !
raj , hull we can thank baroness thatcher for inflicting the current political madness , as grandmother of the neocons she has a lot to answer for in regards to today 's situation .
as for growing up under her iron fisted rule , she stole the milk , introduced the poll tax and privatised the nation 's assets .
gavin hewitson , alnwick , northumberland , england she was a thoughtless , disastrous leader , who devastated the north of england and showed no understanding of , or care for , those in poverty .
the unemployment rate was so high in my northern town during her leadership that some people committed suicide .
people in my family were unemployed for seven years .
during that time , the quality of public healthcare , education and services dropped ; thoroughly dismantling some of britain 's greatest achievements .
i wo n't be celebrating her birthday .
mark , syracuse , ny , usa margaret thatcher can be held accountable for a lot of things but the general disintegration of our society is not one of them john fitzgerald , boston margaret thatcher can be held accountable for a lot of things but the general disintegration of our society is not one of them .
she can not influence the " do n't care " parents and can not be blamed for the behaviour of their loutish offspring .
she can be held accountable for the destruction of this country 's industrial base which , with the demise of rover , has now gone forever .
however i feel we owe her a vote of thanks for the control she exerted over the unions who were far too political .
if the industrial relations laws her government created are so bad why has n't blair repealed them like his unions friends want him to ?
john fitzgerald , boston , england mrs thatcher was an outstanding politician who believed in individualism .
she and her government were set an enormous task to lead britain back to economic recovery .
almost single-handedly she achieved this .
but the truth is that in doing so , she left the impression that she was feelingless .
how great that was .
at least we saw the true woman and she was not afraid to face her public .
what a shame we never see the true side of our current politicians .
perhaps , unlike maggie , they are all scared to be judged .
richard , faringdon , oxon thatcher was a prime minister with a clear vision for britain .
unlike the obsession of today 's politicians , with opinion polls and focus groups , she took a long term view of what was necessary for britain to succeed , whatever the short term unpopularity .
her success can be viewed in comparing the strong performance of the british economy in the last 20 years with the stagnation and high unemployment of france and germany .
she can take enormous pride in this success as she celebrates her birthday .
philip cunningham , dublin , ireland thatcher 's legacy : there is no such thing as a society .
let us leave her and that sentiment where they rightfully belong - in the 20th century ; the century in which selfishness , greed and apathy towards the weak , the poor and the downtrodden became our masters .
david hamilton , karlsruhe , germany i graduated as thatcher was starting on her reforms .
like many i went to work abroad , as there were better opportunities , especially for young people .
now the young of europe come to the uk because of the better opportunities .
having lived in and out of britain since , i would say she has done more good than bad , but it is a more selfish society than it was 25 years ago -lrb- but maybe the whole world is too -rrb- iain , spain she snatched my milk , i shall never forgive her !
-lrb- oh , ok , it was a while ago .
happy birthday mrs t. -rrb-
seriously , i do blame her for the rise in greed and selfishness she generated in this country , but i have to admit she did leave it , on the whole , in a much better state than she found it .
sarah d , norwich , uk baroness thatcher was a great leader .
she turned the country around after years of ill though out socialist policies and her foresight means that we are now one of the most productive and economically healthy countries in europe .
she will always be a hate figure to those who have a nature of dependency and think that the government should solve all of their problems , but to those who make their own luck in this world and are always striding to better themselves , she is rightly revered .
david , uk lady thatcher was detested by the lazy , the unproductive and the scroungers .
she told us that there is no such thing as a free lunch .
she created a climate in which those who wished to work hard could prosper and those who expected hand-outs would not have it so easy .
simon grindrod , cape town , rsa the thatcher legacy definately has two sides .
yes the country was in deep economic trouble when she came to power and she did turn that around .
but the flip side was social disintegration , alienation and , ironically , the total collapse of the " britishness " in our society .
the culture of greed and complete selfishness which has come back to haunt us is as a direct result of the imposition of thatcherism .
there was a choice between poor , just and friendly , or , wealthy , mean and selfish - fairly obvious which one we got .
graeme , england a lot of the people deriding mrs thatcher have probably forgotten the ruinous state britain was in back in 1979 .
top income tax was 99p in the pound !
many people suffered under her time in office , but that was not her doing .
she merely called time on grossly inefficient industries that had been run down since the end of the war .
d. walters , london , uk mrs thatcher 's apologists have created the myth of britain in the 70s as a country on its knees damon cummings , worcester , uk mrs thatcher 's apologists have created the myth of britain in the 70s as a country on its knees .
there may have been problems , but the country i remember was a tolerant place with a sense of community , and where the working person had a bit of dignity .
mrs thatcher 's government destroyed those values and replaced them with the law of the jungle .
it will take time for those values to reassert themselves .
damon cummings , worcester , uk i grew up knowing only mrs t. what a woman !
she knew how to run a country phil , birmingham a lot of people seem to think maggie invented greed .
thatcherite economics -lrb- and capitalism in general -rrb- work because people are greedy , but they do not cause greed , it has always been with us .
there is little doubt that thatcher 's free market reforms are what turned us from being the " sick man of europe " in the seventies to one of the most successful and dynamic economies in europe today .
jeremy , london , uk i was in school and college during the thatcher 's years in government , but what a boost this lady gave to us women and allowed us to aim as high as we wished to go and made me and many of my friends to aim as high as we wished .
thank you for that boost the to female equal opportunities gillian , swansea , wales gladstone formed a government when he was 83 , so there 's hope for us yet russell oaten , bournemouth baroness thatcher was the turning point of the modern british era .
she turned this country around by modernising the economy and kicking the idle off their sofas .
her critics should take a look out of their back yard and see the ailing powers of france and germany still clinging to their traditional industries .
happy birthday , mrs t. jack , london , u.k baroness thatcher created a britain where money was king , and the selfish accumulation of it was a worthy occupation .
she created a culture of selfish , materialistic , ultimately unhappy citizens , having decimated values that money can not buy , like a strong , sense of community , and all the wonderful human characteristics that came with it .
james molloy , glasgow probably started off with the best of intentions but soon unleashed a ghastly torrent of right-wing reforms on a country which is not ideally suited to them .
her policies were a cause of the dreadful " me , me , me " society which characterised the 1980s .
thankfully , her influence is now well and truly behind us so it 's time for the iron lady to ' rust ' in peace .
shaun crowther , barnoldswick , uk she dragged the country kicking and screaming into the 20th century by destroying the unions ' power richard johnson , coventry , uk she dragged the country kicking and screaming into the 20th century by destroying the unions ' power after they 'd crippled the country .
she also had incredible foresight ... if we were still predominantly a manufacturing nation , we 'd be bankrupt by now given the cheaper alternatives abroad .
a job well done .
richard johnson , coventry , uk margaret thatcher and the tories ruined the country , she helped to create mass unemployment , privatised the gas , electricity , water , railways , steel works , shut down the collieries etc and much more .
in total under thatcher & john major we had 18 years of mismanagement .
ian , neath , south wales obviously , a hero and a saint to some ; but certainly a very divisive figure both at home and abroad .
ue , uk / nigeria a wonderful prime minister .
a strong woman .
it is a pity that some liberals in the uk can not see the positive things she did .
in my opinion the current problems are a result of too much labour party in power for far too long since the time of baroness thatcher .
happy birthday to her !
beth , bristow , va usa without thatcher there would be no blair .
not sure that 's a good thing , but undoubtedly she moved the consensus away from government control over the economy so completely that even labour were forced to embrace the market economy .
james , london , uk thatcher put economics and money ahead of people , the old establishment ahead of the trade union power ; she created a policy of greed that has left the uk with a large underclass .
labour has for the most part continued her polices .
the poor get poorer and the rich get richer so that the old establishment and division of power is maintained .
patrick cunningham , yorkshire , uk she stripped the uk of its assets and sold them off to dubious recipients .
only now are we beginning to see the problems this will cause as we realise the country has been bankrupted .
rob , london , uk i used to hate thatcher as i teenager .
she decimated the steel industry my family and friends worked in , created unheard of unemployment so when i left school i was one of 5 million looking for a job .
however , as time passes i see the positives .
we are now the fourth largest economy in the world and chasing germany for third place .
trade unions still have influence but are less likely to ruin the nation to get a point across .
the thatcher years were full of highs and lows but it is undeniable that the basis for britain 's current prosperity is due largely to her leadership in the 80s .
love her or hate her , she was honest and straight and put the country first .
alan lazenby , uk i wish there was a youth pill she could take and come back to lead the party again .
she was brilliant even allowing for her poll tax mistake .
david ball , wokingham , uk unfortunately as a result of her policies we still are suffering from poor policing , health service .
and her policies also instilled greed which is still evident now .
some legacy !
r griffin , romford she destroyed tens of thousands of lives , hundreds of communities , and created a selfish , greedy society .
lee , hebburn , england baroness thatcher was simply one of the greatest prime ministers this country has ever had .
in my opinion she is second only to winston churchill in terms of her achievements .
in particular , her great reforming government of 1979 to 1983 has enabled britain to enjoy the unprecedented levels of prosperity we see today .
her vision of small government , low taxes and freedom of choice are the reason why we have both a vibrant economy and state , unlike our neighbours across the channel .
a jerram , chesterfield , england i quite agree with jim from birmingham , but the price we are still paying is an increase in the rich-poor divide , social disharmony , and the dominance of " me , me , me " selfishness .
as someone on the " rich " side of the divide , i still say that whatever she gave us has n't been worth it .
jon g , huddersfield uk while the economy is stronger , her ultimate legacy is the selfish , ' me-me-me ' society we have today jonathan wright , essex , uk margaret thatcher was a very strong ruler and , after the winter of discontent , it was inevitable that the conservatives would get into power .
she turned britain around , but , while the economy is stronger , her ultimate legacy is the selfish , ' me-me-me ' society we have today .
the " i should have as much money as i want because i 'm worth it " and " the value you have to society is directly proportional to the money and material possessions you have " ethics which pervade society today .
in brief , britain may have a lot of material wealth , but its moral wealth is decreasing rapidly day to day .
jonathan wright , essex , uk elements of " thatcherism " were almost inevitably stolen by labour , and this is her most significant legacy .
throughout history , labour governments were never " socialist " in any meaningful sense , but it is doubtful if " new labour " would ever have come into being had it not been for baroness thatcher .
a sellar , edinburgh , uk our greatest leader ever .
the only politician in the modern era to have any honesty and integrity .
on top of that she made us prosperous instead of robbing us blind with taxes .
keith , uk baroness thatcher 's influence at the time was to put the country back on its feet after it was devastated by the unions .
if you doubt this , look at how thatcherite the present government is .
jim , birmingham , uk margaret thatcher was exactly what britain needed in the late 1970s johann , london , uk margaret thatcher was exactly what britain needed in the late 1970s when the country was crippled by industrial action .
she was on the whole a very successful prime minister .
however she remained in office too long , and her political instincts started to fail her during her last two years as pm .
this caused tremendous turmoil , resentment and rifts within her party .
in fact , the conservatives are still to this day feeling the long hangover her legacy has left .
johann , london , uk baroness thatcher has been , quite simply , the only politician with whom the public has connected with .
her name summons an immediate reaction , good or bad .
but whatever your view , one can not deny that mrs thatcher gave this country a strong grounding to step proudly into the 21st century .
she is also a leader of true social policy - a subject many of her enemies choose to blindly ignore - having been the first prime minister to allow thousands of people dependent on the state for housing , to afford their own homes .
if that 's not helping to ' spread the wealth ' then i do n't know what is !
ben bailey , eastbourne , england look around you now ; depleted public transport , disaffected & alienated youths , endemic corporate avarice , the well qualified working in call centres , all borne from the policies of this demi-despot .
sure , south england prospers but the rest , especially the working classes , are adrift in a sea of survival .
peter , wales maggie was great .
she sorted out the complete mess that labour had left in the 70s and turned britain 's economic fortunes around .
i 'd vote for her now if she stood - i 'm fed up with tax and spend .
douglas , milton keynes , uk thatcher , " there 's no such thing as society " , will be remembered with hatred and dread by the millions of british people whose lives she wrecked .
mark blackman , london she devastated primarily the north of britain with vindictive and oppressive policies .
she made a few people very prosperous and caused untold hardship for many decent working people -lrb- even if some of them were part of a union -rrb- .
was the architect of the demise of uk manufacturing .
nothing like our greatest ever leader at all .
ian , lanarkshire she is a role model to all women with sanity .
she is a mother , house wife , business woman and politician .
she proved to the world that handling various chores at the same time was just a cup of tea .
i must admit that running affairs of learned british folk is not all that bed of roses , but she did and made it .
she was more than ten women and if science and technology made cloning so easy and cheap , we could request for a thousand iron ladies .
she is like my own mother who stood for liberty , justice and fair play in all her dealings .
these are the sort of women i leave space for in this millennium .
she has not only influenced politics in the uk .
the whole world holds her in the very highest esteem .
shuttie f.n.libuta , kitwe / zambia / central africa i feel sure that in the future history will show what a disaster thatcherism actually was for this country .
in my opinion a lot of the problem in this country today can have their origins traced back to her reign .
mike , eastleigh what a lady .
she fought for britain with every breath .
we should not forget that she brought the americans and russians together to end the cold war .
her only mistake was to think the majority of britain would accept to pay their equal share of local services .
happy birthday mrs thatcher , i for one will always be grateful for what you did for our country .
ian , london , england without the period of thatcherism we would now be a third world country alan preddy , epsom without the period of thatcherism we would now be a third world country , totally ruled by europe bankrupted by bailing out unwanted coal mines , steel works etc .
rubbish would be piling up on the streets and the socialist government would be living off what remained of the fat of the land and ignoring the real problems of the day .
thank you maggie for saving us and this country .
alan preddy , epsom her influence was immense .
the first woman leader of a political party , the first woman prime minister .
she embraced capitalism and encouraged everyone to achieve their best .
she rejoiced in success and drove others to be entrepreneurial and saw business as the primary driver behind economic prosperity .
her greatest quote - " there is no such thing as society ; there are individuals and there are families " was true then and is true today .
if only her successors and her opposition could grasp the greatness of the fundamental ideology that we are responsible for ourselves and not to rely on government - and hence the earnings of others - to pay for our lifestyle , this country would be a better place .
she made mistakes and in the later years she appeared really quite strange and dangerous .
but essentially , she was brilliant because she possessed that which is completely lacking from today 's political scene : a belief system .
tom franklin , london , uk people in seem to have forgotten that the uk was bankrupt and under imf supervision when she became leader .
she returned this country to greatness and created the economic boom that labour is so keen to claim as its own .
mark , london baroness thatcher did a great service to this nation ; she nurtured her pompous and egotistic party until it believed its own myth .
the tories have no noblesse oblige in british politics and until they learn humility and that it is the people 's choice who rules britain and not theirs then they will never have power again in this country .
jamie taylor , soho , london she saved this country from total ruin as a result of bullying unions and a labour government bent on tax and spend .
it was painful at times but it had to be done - remember that labour had reduced us to the status of a banana republic a few years before when they had to call in the imf to bail us out .
unfortunately memories fade and people forget that one of the architects of labour 79 was one gordon brown .
i wonder who is going to save us this time when brown has finished wrecking the country .
thank you maggie for all the hope and prosperity that you gave to the real hard working people of this country .
neil , liverpool uk oh - and worthless pension schemes !
the more i think the more i realise what a mess she left this country in .
i 'd rather not think about her at all !
