the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .
-lrb- nov .
18 , 2005 -rrb- india might be unable to commit after 2012 according to one of the un 's top climate experts , india will be unable to commit to greenhouse gas emission targets when the first phase of the kyoto treaty , designed to combat global warming , ends in 2012 .

reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .

frank ficker of freiburg must have thought he had it all : successful wife , nice home , and a mistress on the side .
but the family parrot , a pro at imitating frank , blew the lid on his cheating ways . frank ficker 's wife , once described her husband , who she met through a personal ad , as " so affectionate . "
it 's likely she has a few other adjectives for him now , ever since she found out he was fooling around with a woman name uta . the affair that frank , 50 , was having might have gone undiscovered had his wife , we 'll call her petra , also aged 50 , not owned a grey parrot name hugo . hugo , like many of his species , was something akin to a living tape recorder , and especially good at imitating frank . " hugo always liked to mimic frank and he could do his voice perfectly , " said petra .
that included perfect renditions of frank asking who was at the door or yelling at his nephews .
but one day petra heard the bird repeating something she 'd never hard before . " i heard him doing frank 's voice , but saying ' uta , uta , " ' she said . since petra did n't know an uta , nor had she ever heard frank mention her , her suspicions were raised .
a search around the house turned up two plane tickets to paris , one for frank , another for uta , who was , evidently , the other woman .
it turns out that hugo was often within earshot when frank would make secret phone calls to his lover . " i kicked him straight out , " she said .

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status .

the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .
the physicians ' union has been in negotiations with the association of communal employers -lrb- vka -rrb- for weeks regarding the working conditions at 700 communal hospitals across the country .

" german health minister ulla schmidt said in an interview on sunday evening that she was hoping for a " realistic resolution " of the negotiations , but warned that the wage increase of 30 percent was excessive and an unnecessary burden for the negotiations . ehl , on the other hand , rebuffed schmidt 's comments as " meddling " and " populist statements .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management .

he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status . " we must get rid of overtime hours , also in the sense of patient protection , " said albrecht . long hours , small pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : largest university hospital in europe : charite in berlin according to charite medical workers , the employees put in 85,000 overtime work hours each month , mostly without receiving any monetary compensation .
furthermore , the doctors ' wages fell by 7.5 percent in the period from 1993 to 2002 .
the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .
the physicians ' union has been in negotiations with the association of communal employers -lrb- vka -rrb- for weeks regarding the working conditions at 700 communal hospitals across the country .
the union request for a 30 percent increase in wages has been rejected by vka as " excessive . " consequently , the marburger bund announced it was planning a series of pinpoint strikes across the country on dec .

" german health minister ulla schmidt said in an interview on sunday evening that she was hoping for a " realistic resolution " of the negotiations , but warned that the wage increase of 30 percent was excessive and an unnecessary burden for the negotiations . ehl , on the other hand , rebuffed schmidt 's comments as " meddling " and " populist statements . " no open confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting rid of overtime hours should help patients get better service the management of the charite hospital would like to avoid an open confrontation with the doctors . " i am not happy that the doctors have gone on strike , but i assume that this has been a difficult decision for them as well , " said hospital director behrend behrends . according to behrends , the current situation is not an internal hospital matter , but rather a result of federal policies . president of the german chamber of physicians jörg-dietrich hoppe defended the strike and the request for wage increase as justifiable . " more work for less money is not fair , " said hoppe . the medical school and university hospital of berlin 's humboldt university , charite is the largest university hospital in europe with 2,037 beds in 49 clinics .

the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .
-lrb- nov .
18 , 2005 -rrb- india might be unable to commit after 2012 according to one of the un 's top climate experts , india will be unable to commit to greenhouse gas emission targets when the first phase of the kyoto treaty , designed to combat global warming , ends in 2012 .
german minister 's katrina remarks irk us as the us grapples to contain the devastation wreaked by katrina , germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin is experiencing a storm of outrage following his suggestion that the us brought the catastrophe on itself .

frank ficker of freiburg must have thought he had it all : successful wife , nice home , and a mistress on the side .
but the family parrot , a pro at imitating frank , blew the lid on his cheating ways . frank ficker 's wife , once described her husband , who she met through a personal ad , as " so affectionate . "
it 's likely she has a few other adjectives for him now , ever since she found out he was fooling around with a woman name uta . the affair that frank , 50 , was having might have gone undiscovered had his wife , we 'll call her petra , also aged 50 , not owned a grey parrot name hugo . hugo , like many of his species , was something akin to a living tape recorder , and especially good at imitating frank . " hugo always liked to mimic frank and he could do his voice perfectly , " said petra .
that included perfect renditions of frank asking who was at the door or yelling at his nephews .
but one day petra heard the bird repeating something she 'd never hard before . " i heard him doing frank 's voice , but saying ' uta , uta , " ' she said . since petra did n't know an uta , nor had she ever heard frank mention her , her suspicions were raised .
a search around the house turned up two plane tickets to paris , one for frank , another for uta , who was , evidently , the other woman .
it turns out that hugo was often within earshot when frank would make secret phone calls to his lover . " i kicked him straight out , " she said .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management . " the board of directors of dofasco unanimously recommends that its shareholders accept the offer , " it said . an important step for thyssenkrupp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp wants to expand its market presence in north america the offer price represented a 40 percent premium over dofasco 's closing share price on the toronto stock exchange on nov .
22 , 2005 , the day prior to the announcement of the hostile takeover bid by european steel giant arcelor at a price of 56.00 canadian dollars per share . " it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds . " the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2006 . investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp shares took a plunge after the takeover announcement investors were not impressed by the announcement .
thyssenkrupp shares , trading higher earlier in the session , plummeted to an intraday low of 16.92 euros , down 0.64 euros or 3.6 percent on the day in a generally firmer market . arcelor , a european company with headquarters in luxembourg , declined to comment on the announcement by thyssenkrupp , while shares in the company fell 1.22 percent to 20.22 euros on the paris stock exchange . arcelor had explained last week that the acquisition of dofasco would accomplish the joint strategic objectives of gaining a presence in north america and expanding its production of steel for the auto sector . an analyst of the steel sector , who asked not to be identified , said that arcelor risked losing a good acquisition opportunity at a reasonable price .
he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues .

there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "
cosy with condi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier said he was looking forward to talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , whom he met on several occasions while serving as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff . " she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .
he will meet rice , deputy secretary of state robert zoellick and the white house national security adviser , stephen hadley , in washington tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister concerned about reported cia flights new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said he is concerned about reports that cia aircraft have used german airports while transporting prisoners to alleged secret prison camps .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "
cosy with condi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier said he was looking forward to talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , whom he met on several occasions while serving as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff . " she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2005 climate meeting to look beyond kyoto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher temperatures have affected arctic sea ice canada is hosting the first climate-change conference since the kyoto protocol was put into effect last february , and forecasters are calling for hot debate . around 10,000 delegates from nearly 190 countries are in montreal for what is expected to be an intense debate on climate change .
the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "
cosy with condi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier said he was looking forward to talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , whom he met on several occasions while serving as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff . " she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .
he will meet rice , deputy secretary of state robert zoellick and the white house national security adviser , stephen hadley , in washington tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister concerned about reported cia flights new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said he is concerned about reports that cia aircraft have used german airports while transporting prisoners to alleged secret prison camps .

the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "

" she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status . " we must get rid of overtime hours , also in the sense of patient protection , " said albrecht . long hours , small pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : largest university hospital in europe : charite in berlin according to charite medical workers , the employees put in 85,000 overtime work hours each month , mostly without receiving any monetary compensation .
furthermore , the doctors ' wages fell by 7.5 percent in the period from 1993 to 2002 .
the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .
the physicians ' union has been in negotiations with the association of communal employers -lrb- vka -rrb- for weeks regarding the working conditions at 700 communal hospitals across the country .
the union request for a 30 percent increase in wages has been rejected by vka as " excessive . " consequently , the marburger bund announced it was planning a series of pinpoint strikes across the country on dec .

" german health minister ulla schmidt said in an interview on sunday evening that she was hoping for a " realistic resolution " of the negotiations , but warned that the wage increase of 30 percent was excessive and an unnecessary burden for the negotiations . ehl , on the other hand , rebuffed schmidt 's comments as " meddling " and " populist statements . " no open confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting rid of overtime hours should help patients get better service the management of the charite hospital would like to avoid an open confrontation with the doctors . " i am not happy that the doctors have gone on strike , but i assume that this has been a difficult decision for them as well , " said hospital director behrend behrends . according to behrends , the current situation is not an internal hospital matter , but rather a result of federal policies . president of the german chamber of physicians jörg-dietrich hoppe defended the strike and the request for wage increase as justifiable . " more work for less money is not fair , " said hoppe . the medical school and university hospital of berlin 's humboldt university , charite is the largest university hospital in europe with 2,037 beds in 49 clinics .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors .

" it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .

frank ficker of freiburg must have thought he had it all : successful wife , nice home , and a mistress on the side .
but the family parrot , a pro at imitating frank , blew the lid on his cheating ways . frank ficker 's wife , once described her husband , who she met through a personal ad , as " so affectionate . "
it 's likely she has a few other adjectives for him now , ever since she found out he was fooling around with a woman name uta . the affair that frank , 50 , was having might have gone undiscovered had his wife , we 'll call her petra , also aged 50 , not owned a grey parrot name hugo . hugo , like many of his species , was something akin to a living tape recorder , and especially good at imitating frank . " hugo always liked to mimic frank and he could do his voice perfectly , " said petra .
that included perfect renditions of frank asking who was at the door or yelling at his nephews .
but one day petra heard the bird repeating something she 'd never hard before . " i heard him doing frank 's voice , but saying ' uta , uta , " ' she said . since petra did n't know an uta , nor had she ever heard frank mention her , her suspicions were raised .
a search around the house turned up two plane tickets to paris , one for frank , another for uta , who was , evidently , the other woman .
it turns out that hugo was often within earshot when frank would make secret phone calls to his lover . " i kicked him straight out , " she said .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "

" she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management .

" it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds .

he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

frank ficker of freiburg must have thought he had it all : successful wife , nice home , and a mistress on the side .
but the family parrot , a pro at imitating frank , blew the lid on his cheating ways . frank ficker 's wife , once described her husband , who she met through a personal ad , as " so affectionate . "
it 's likely she has a few other adjectives for him now , ever since she found out he was fooling around with a woman name uta . the affair that frank , 50 , was having might have gone undiscovered had his wife , we 'll call her petra , also aged 50 , not owned a grey parrot name hugo . hugo , like many of his species , was something akin to a living tape recorder , and especially good at imitating frank .

next to the us , russia is the single largest pollutent , and its approval was needed for kyoto to go into effect .
when moscow ratified the treaty , europe heralded the news as a success for global climate control and prophesized a brighter future for the environment .

but despite several smaller conferences focusing on renewable energies and reducing the world 's dependency on oil , not much has really changed in terms of global environmental committment , as dw commentators point out .

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status . " we must get rid of overtime hours , also in the sense of patient protection , " said albrecht . long hours , small pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : largest university hospital in europe : charite in berlin according to charite medical workers , the employees put in 85,000 overtime work hours each month , mostly without receiving any monetary compensation .
furthermore , the doctors ' wages fell by 7.5 percent in the period from 1993 to 2002 .
the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .
the physicians ' union has been in negotiations with the association of communal employers -lrb- vka -rrb- for weeks regarding the working conditions at 700 communal hospitals across the country .
the union request for a 30 percent increase in wages has been rejected by vka as " excessive . " consequently , the marburger bund announced it was planning a series of pinpoint strikes across the country on dec .

frank ficker of freiburg must have thought he had it all : successful wife , nice home , and a mistress on the side .
but the family parrot , a pro at imitating frank , blew the lid on his cheating ways . frank ficker 's wife , once described her husband , who she met through a personal ad , as " so affectionate . "
it 's likely she has a few other adjectives for him now , ever since she found out he was fooling around with a woman name uta . the affair that frank , 50 , was having might have gone undiscovered had his wife , we 'll call her petra , also aged 50 , not owned a grey parrot name hugo . hugo , like many of his species , was something akin to a living tape recorder , and especially good at imitating frank . " hugo always liked to mimic frank and he could do his voice perfectly , " said petra .
that included perfect renditions of frank asking who was at the door or yelling at his nephews .
but one day petra heard the bird repeating something she 'd never hard before . " i heard him doing frank 's voice , but saying ' uta , uta , " ' she said . since petra did n't know an uta , nor had she ever heard frank mention her , her suspicions were raised .
a search around the house turned up two plane tickets to paris , one for frank , another for uta , who was , evidently , the other woman .
it turns out that hugo was often within earshot when frank would make secret phone calls to his lover . " i kicked him straight out , " she said .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management . " the board of directors of dofasco unanimously recommends that its shareholders accept the offer , " it said . an important step for thyssenkrupp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp wants to expand its market presence in north america the offer price represented a 40 percent premium over dofasco 's closing share price on the toronto stock exchange on nov .
22 , 2005 , the day prior to the announcement of the hostile takeover bid by european steel giant arcelor at a price of 56.00 canadian dollars per share . " it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds . " the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2006 . investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp shares took a plunge after the takeover announcement investors were not impressed by the announcement .
thyssenkrupp shares , trading higher earlier in the session , plummeted to an intraday low of 16.92 euros , down 0.64 euros or 3.6 percent on the day in a generally firmer market . arcelor , a european company with headquarters in luxembourg , declined to comment on the announcement by thyssenkrupp , while shares in the company fell 1.22 percent to 20.22 euros on the paris stock exchange . arcelor had explained last week that the acquisition of dofasco would accomplish the joint strategic objectives of gaining a presence in north america and expanding its production of steel for the auto sector . an analyst of the steel sector , who asked not to be identified , said that arcelor risked losing a good acquisition opportunity at a reasonable price .
he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 28.11.2005 merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has a different agenda than her predecessor german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "
cosy with condi bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier steinmeier said he was looking forward to talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , whom he met on several occasions while serving as former chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff . " she called and invited me to washington right after i was named .
we already worked closely together this week on the conflict with iran , " he said , referring to tehran 's controversial nuclear program . he expressed concern in the interview about reports that cia aircraft had allegedly touched down at german airports while transporting prisoners to secret prison camps in other countries . several german officials are calling for steinmeier to raise the issue in washington . steinmeier 's two-day us visit will start in new york monday with a meeting with un secretary general kofi annan and leading representatives of jewish organizations .
he will meet rice , deputy secretary of state robert zoellick and the white house national security adviser , stephen hadley , in washington tuesday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister concerned about reported cia flights new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has said he is concerned about reports that cia aircraft have used german airports while transporting prisoners to alleged secret prison camps .

the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management . " the board of directors of dofasco unanimously recommends that its shareholders accept the offer , " it said . an important step for thyssenkrupp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp wants to expand its market presence in north america the offer price represented a 40 percent premium over dofasco 's closing share price on the toronto stock exchange on nov .
22 , 2005 , the day prior to the announcement of the hostile takeover bid by european steel giant arcelor at a price of 56.00 canadian dollars per share . " it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds . " the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2006 . investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp shares took a plunge after the takeover announcement investors were not impressed by the announcement .
thyssenkrupp shares , trading higher earlier in the session , plummeted to an intraday low of 16.92 euros , down 0.64 euros or 3.6 percent on the day in a generally firmer market . arcelor , a european company with headquarters in luxembourg , declined to comment on the announcement by thyssenkrupp , while shares in the company fell 1.22 percent to 20.22 euros on the paris stock exchange . arcelor had explained last week that the acquisition of dofasco would accomplish the joint strategic objectives of gaining a presence in north america and expanding its production of steel for the auto sector . an analyst of the steel sector , who asked not to be identified , said that arcelor risked losing a good acquisition opportunity at a reasonable price .
he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management . " the board of directors of dofasco unanimously recommends that its shareholders accept the offer , " it said . an important step for thyssenkrupp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp wants to expand its market presence in north america the offer price represented a 40 percent premium over dofasco 's closing share price on the toronto stock exchange on nov .
22 , 2005 , the day prior to the announcement of the hostile takeover bid by european steel giant arcelor at a price of 56.00 canadian dollars per share . " it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds . " the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2006 . investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp shares took a plunge after the takeover announcement investors were not impressed by the announcement .
thyssenkrupp shares , trading higher earlier in the session , plummeted to an intraday low of 16.92 euros , down 0.64 euros or 3.6 percent on the day in a generally firmer market . arcelor , a european company with headquarters in luxembourg , declined to comment on the announcement by thyssenkrupp , while shares in the company fell 1.22 percent to 20.22 euros on the paris stock exchange . arcelor had explained last week that the acquisition of dofasco would accomplish the joint strategic objectives of gaining a presence in north america and expanding its production of steel for the auto sector . an analyst of the steel sector , who asked not to be identified , said that arcelor risked losing a good acquisition opportunity at a reasonable price .
he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .

the meeting 's main objective is to review the united nation ’ s kyoto protocol , which forces industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions , which are known to cause global warming . the summit is considered the most important since the kyoto protocol was signed in 1997 , which only went into effect last february , after russia ratified the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un framework convention on climate change logo one of the meeting 's main aims is to streamline " green " projects in developing countries and address funding issues . " the parties are going to put in place the detailed rule book which will get the protocol in operation , " said richard kinley , acting director of the united nations framework convention on climate change . europe far from target in many cases , this involves simply adopting certain decisions that have already been agreed to .
the meeting 's other purpose is to discuss future reductions of greenhouse gas emissions after the protocol time frame runs out , in 2012 .
under the terms of the accord , 38 leading industrial countries agreed to lower the emissions from six gases until they are 5.2 percent less than the levels in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then-environment minister jürgen trittin marked kyoto 's start most of the signatory countries are already behind in their obligations .
for example the european union promised an 8 percent reduction but has only managed to cut greenhouse emissions by 1.4 percent thus far . seeking post 2012 model yet herman ott , an expert at germany 's wuppertal institute for climate , environment and energy , said he hopes governments will focus on the protocol 's strengths rather than its weaknesses . " for the next years , the main emphasis should be on implementation - we ’ ve got the treaty , it is in force .
there are obligations in there for industrial nations and they ’ ve got to comply with that , " he said . the measures can be a " model for the future after 2012 " if they are shown to work , he added . the world ’ s number one polluter , the united states , will likely make sure it is not drawn into binding targets similar to those set out in the protocol .
along with australia , the us refused to ratify the protocol , saying it would be bad for the nation 's economy . developing nations on alert but stephan singer , head of the international office of the environmental group wwf , said us behavior shouldn ’ t stop the rest of the world from moving forward . " the us is just one country .
we have more and more indication from many developing countries that they are interested of having a second phase of kyoto-type legally binding cap and trade targets , ” singer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia , known for its great barrier reef , refused to sign according to projections , climate change will hit developing countries the hardest .
already the world has its first-ever climate-change refugees .
around 2,000 people are to be evacuated from small islands in the pacific because of rising ocean levels . another likely topic at the climate meeting is the world 's response to climate change .
governments have to move away from the idea of preventing climate change , and start preparing for its effects , experts said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rich countries cut emissions , more needed un scientists say rich nations have managed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions by around 6 percent .
but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly .

18 , 2005 -rrb- india might be unable to commit after 2012 according to one of the un 's top climate experts , india will be unable to commit to greenhouse gas emission targets when the first phase of the kyoto treaty , designed to combat global warming , ends in 2012 .
german minister 's katrina remarks irk us as the us grapples to contain the devastation wreaked by katrina , germany 's environment minister , jürgen trittin is experiencing a storm of outrage following his suggestion that the us brought the catastrophe on itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 28.11.2005 merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has a different agenda than her predecessor german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status . " we must get rid of overtime hours , also in the sense of patient protection , " said albrecht . long hours , small pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : largest university hospital in europe : charite in berlin according to charite medical workers , the employees put in 85,000 overtime work hours each month , mostly without receiving any monetary compensation .

the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .
the physicians ' union has been in negotiations with the association of communal employers -lrb- vka -rrb- for weeks regarding the working conditions at 700 communal hospitals across the country .
the union request for a 30 percent increase in wages has been rejected by vka as " excessive . " consequently , the marburger bund announced it was planning a series of pinpoint strikes across the country on dec .

" german health minister ulla schmidt said in an interview on sunday evening that she was hoping for a " realistic resolution " of the negotiations , but warned that the wage increase of 30 percent was excessive and an unnecessary burden for the negotiations . ehl , on the other hand , rebuffed schmidt 's comments as " meddling " and " populist statements .

" i am not happy that the doctors have gone on strike , but i assume that this has been a difficult decision for them as well , " said hospital director behrend behrends . according to behrends , the current situation is not an internal hospital matter , but rather a result of federal policies . president of the german chamber of physicians jörg-dietrich hoppe defended the strike and the request for wage increase as justifiable . " more work for less money is not fair , " said hoppe . the medical school and university hospital of berlin 's humboldt university , charite is the largest university hospital in europe with 2,037 beds in 49 clinics .

the week-long strike is expected to include not only traditional demonstrations , but also info-sessions for the general population , for example in shopping malls . the doctors are urging hospital administrators to approve a collective wage agreement for medical workers that will improve their financial status . " we must get rid of overtime hours , also in the sense of patient protection , " said albrecht . long hours , small pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : largest university hospital in europe : charite in berlin according to charite medical workers , the employees put in 85,000 overtime work hours each month , mostly without receiving any monetary compensation .
furthermore , the doctors ' wages fell by 7.5 percent in the period from 1993 to 2002 .
the university hospital , which combines a network of clinics across the once divided city , is expected to cut 266 million euros -lrb- $ 312 million -rrb- in expenses until 2010 . the strike in berlin , however , is only a warning sign for the overall predicament of german medical workers .

the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us . during her first week in office , angela merkel has given political observers plenty to contemplate regarding the future direction of germany 's international relations .
however , the verdict is still out as to whether or not she will set a different course from her predecessor . " relations with the smaller member states of the european union will be intensified , " merkel , who took office nov .
22 , told newsweekly focus .
" and there will be a more intense transatlantic relationship , " she said in an obvious reference to the difficult ties between germany and the us under the former government . " but that is not intended as a message against anyone , " she added , lest analysts jump to conclusions . merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , had turned away from germany 's traditional ally , the us , electing to cultivate instead a close partnership with france .
critics said the focus on the berlin-paris axis - particularly during the run-up to the iraq war - compromised ties with washington , as well as dampened relations with some eu countries . therefore , many watched closely for a sign as merkel made her first foreign trip as chancellor to paris wednesday in keeping with a precedent established by former chancellors . " on my trip to paris , it was very clear that i would like to maintain friendly relations with france in the tradition of earlier chancellors , " she said , but also implied that she would not neglect the smaller eu states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in brussels with nato head jaap de hoop scheffer on the united states , merkel said bilateral political ties were anchored at nato . " it was a very intentional move to visit nato as well as the european institutions in brussels , " she said of her trip to the city wednesday .
reviving transatlantic relations in a separate interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he saw no need for a " fresh start " in transatlantic ties despite the lingering tension over german opposition to the us-led iraq war . " we are standing by our position -lrb- on iraq -rrb- for good reasons , " he said , noting that merkel 's new left-right coalition government had also ruled out sending german troops to the war-ravaged country .
but the social democrat emphasized that berlin and washington had " the same interests and goals on the vast majority of issues . " " we support washington in all its efforts so that peace in the middle east has a chance , " he said .
" and we want to make some real progress together on climate protection .
the disastrous hurricanes in the south of the united states have also made the american public stop and think . "

analysts and investors remain skeptical . german heavy industry giant thyssenkrupp , based in düsseldorf , said on monday it was coming to the rescue of canadian steel maker dofasco by launching a friendly takeover bid to help ward off hostile predator arcelor . thyssenkrupp said in a statement it was offering to buy dofasco for 61.50 canadian dollars per share -lrb- us $ 52.55 , 44.80 euros -rrb- in a deal that valued the canadian group at 3.5 billion euros . the german group said the bid had the approval of dofasco 's management . " the board of directors of dofasco unanimously recommends that its shareholders accept the offer , " it said . an important step for thyssenkrupp bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp wants to expand its market presence in north america the offer price represented a 40 percent premium over dofasco 's closing share price on the toronto stock exchange on nov .
22 , 2005 , the day prior to the announcement of the hostile takeover bid by european steel giant arcelor at a price of 56.00 canadian dollars per share . " it further represents a 9.8-percent premium over the arcelor bid , " thyssenkrupp said . for thyssenkrupp , the takeover of the canadian company - the largest since the german company acquired giddings & lewis inc. for 628.5 million euros in 1997 - would be an " important step " in its strategy of expanding in the area of flat-rolled carbon steel . " the combination of dofasco 's production and distribution operations with thyssenkrupp 's existing processing activities will strengthen thyssenkrupp 's presence in the steel market in the north american free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " the company said . thyssenkrupp would finance the deal " in full from available cash funds . " the transaction is expected to be completed before the end of first quarter of 2006 . investors not impressed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thyssenkrupp shares took a plunge after the takeover announcement investors were not impressed by the announcement .
thyssenkrupp shares , trading higher earlier in the session , plummeted to an intraday low of 16.92 euros , down 0.64 euros or 3.6 percent on the day in a generally firmer market . arcelor , a european company with headquarters in luxembourg , declined to comment on the announcement by thyssenkrupp , while shares in the company fell 1.22 percent to 20.22 euros on the paris stock exchange . arcelor had explained last week that the acquisition of dofasco would accomplish the joint strategic objectives of gaining a presence in north america and expanding its production of steel for the auto sector . an analyst of the steel sector , who asked not to be identified , said that arcelor risked losing a good acquisition opportunity at a reasonable price .
he also questioned the logic of the acquisition for thyssenkrupp . " it 's negative for arcelor , " said the analyst .
" but it 's even more negative for thyssenkrupp because the price is high and we 're not sure what the synergies will be behind it all .

there have been claims rules in other eu countries mean gas held in storage is not being released for export .
ofgem has asked the european commission to investigate whether recent high prices are due to " market distortion " .
it also warned that there could be more price rises for uk consumers this winter , and that supply will be tight .
cold weather the past two weeks have produced hefty price increases in gas , leading to concerns of problems for high-use uk industries .
fears have been growing among business leaders over future power supplies and rising gas costs .
consumers need to be satisfied there are no signs the uk market is being manipulated from europe ofgem eu threatens action on gas prices yet the gas pipeline between britain and the continent has not been running at full capacity .
ofgem has called for an immediate investigation into why this has happened .
an ofgem spokesman said : " we are looking for answers to the recent inflation in prices .
" we need to determine that the price movements have been caused by supply and demand factors , rather than any distortion of the market .
" consumers need to be satisfied there are no signs the uk market is being manipulated from europe . "
flows slow the bbc 's economics editor evan davis said : " the regulator is especially concerned at the odd european gas market .
" relatively little gas flowed into britain last week , even when the price was so high you 'd think foreigners would have queued up to supply us .
" for example , there 's a curious spanish regulation that penalises global gas suppliers who fail to meet supply commitments there .
" and spain 's designed the penalty specifically to ensure that whatever 's happening in the uk , it 's better for the gas companies to supply spain first . "
ofgem confirmed to the bbc that spain had appeared to be outbidding uk market prices in order to get supplies to go to home territory .
" we have been concerned with the actions of spain .
we have lodged our concerns with brussels , " ofgem chief executive alistair buchanan told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
steep rises in september , british gas announced it was putting up bills by 14.2 % - equivalent to £ 96 on the average household bill - with other suppliers following suit .
on 22 november , wholesale prices hit their highest level since march , at £ 1.40 a therm .
as well as an erratically performing european market , traders blame the price rises on factors including dwindling north sea supplies , and the recent cold weather .
ofgem told the bbc it was investigating the cause of recent price rises .
" sadly we 've already had a very large round of increases .
every 10 % increase in energy prices puts 400,000 people back into fuel poverty , " alistair buchanan said .
however , ofgem stressed that gas supplies were unlikely to be affected unless there was a particularly severe winter this year .

ken loach 's films include kes , ae fond kiss and my name is joe in 2001 loach directed the navigators , a one-off tv drama about the privatisation of british rail and the job losses and cutbacks that ensued .
this month sees him return to the railways , albeit in a rather different capacity .
in tickets , the veteran film-maker directs one of three interlocking stories set on the same rome-bound train .
as usual , loach tackles serious issues - in this case , the plight of illegal immigrants from eastern europe and the persecution and hostility they often face in the west .
the film started when iranian film-maker abbas kiarostami suggested producing a trilogy of feature-length documentaries by three different directors .
kiarostami approached loach and italy 's ermanno olmi , who suggested making it a fictional movie instead .
' friendly cooperation ' " we got together a couple of times and the idea of a train journey linking the stories came up , " loach told the bbc news website .
" we tried to make connections between the stories , with characters appearing in more than one .
" inevitably people do what they were going to do anyway , but it was a very friendly co-operation and we enjoyed each other 's company . "
loach directs tickets with abbas kiarostami -lrb- l -rrb- and ermanno olmi -lrb- r -rrb- fans of loach 's work will recognise the heroes of his episode , who are played by a trio of young scottish actors who appeared in his 2002 film sweet sixteen .
" they 're not playing the same characters obviously , but when we were planning the story those three lads fit the bill . "
the story , written by loach 's regular collaborator paul laverty , tells of a group of celtic fans whose journey to a champions league match hits the buffers when a young stowaway steals one of their tickets .
the theft brings them into contact with an albanian family making a perilous trip across the continent .
" it 's about three football supporters who are drawn into a real life-and-death situation involving people from a similar social class , " said loach .
" they could be the equivalents of their mothers or sisters or brothers , caught in a situation that is pretty desperate .
" it 's a very human dilemma - the struggle between getting involved and not getting involved , " he continued .
' pivotal event ' " but it 's not a message film , despite some of the ideas that are kicking around underneath . "
the plot sounds simple , but getting the multinational production made on the tightest of budgets was anything but .
" planning and italian film-making are mutually exclusive concepts , " loach remarks wryly .
loach 's segment reunites him with actors from sweet sixteen " but once we got the train journey worked out it was n't so bad and the shooting was fairly straightforward .
" we set our story in second class , while the other two wisely put theirs in first class , " he continues .
" there was no air conditioning where we were , so we sweltered for eight days . "
tickets marks a change of pace following loach 's recent pictures , which include spanish civil war drama land and freedom and bread and roses , his first film to be shot in america .
his next project , the wind that shakes the barley , is no less ambitious , being set during the time of the irish war of independence and the civil war that followed .
" it was a pivotal event for britain and for ireland , the story of which we 've largely forgotten , " he says .
" it 's set in the past and it 's about a war , so it is bound to have some similarities with land and freedom .
but we 're in the thick of it at the moment so i dare n't say too much . "
tickets is due to open in the uk on 2 december .

loach directs tickets with abbas kiarostami -lrb- l -rrb- and ermanno olmi -lrb- r -rrb- fans of loach 's work will recognise the heroes of his episode , who are played by a trio of young scottish actors who appeared in his 2002 film sweet sixteen .
" they 're not playing the same characters obviously , but when we were planning the story those three lads fit the bill . "
the story , written by loach 's regular collaborator paul laverty , tells of a group of celtic fans whose journey to a champions league match hits the buffers when a young stowaway steals one of their tickets .
the theft brings them into contact with an albanian family making a perilous trip across the continent .
" it 's about three football supporters who are drawn into a real life-and-death situation involving people from a similar social class , " said loach .
" they could be the equivalents of their mothers or sisters or brothers , caught in a situation that is pretty desperate .
" it 's a very human dilemma - the struggle between getting involved and not getting involved , " he continued .
' pivotal event ' " but it 's not a message film , despite some of the ideas that are kicking around underneath . "
the plot sounds simple , but getting the multinational production made on the tightest of budgets was anything but .
" planning and italian film-making are mutually exclusive concepts , " loach remarks wryly .
loach 's segment reunites him with actors from sweet sixteen " but once we got the train journey worked out it was n't so bad and the shooting was fairly straightforward .
" we set our story in second class , while the other two wisely put theirs in first class , " he continues .
" there was no air conditioning where we were , so we sweltered for eight days . "
tickets marks a change of pace following loach 's recent pictures , which include spanish civil war drama land and freedom and bread and roses , his first film to be shot in america .
his next project , the wind that shakes the barley , is no less ambitious , being set during the time of the irish war of independence and the civil war that followed .
" it was a pivotal event for britain and for ireland , the story of which we 've largely forgotten , " he says .
" it 's set in the past and it 's about a war , so it is bound to have some similarities with land and freedom .
but we 're in the thick of it at the moment so i dare n't say too much . "
