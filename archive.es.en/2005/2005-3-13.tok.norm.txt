pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .
cooperating with the society for german language , ministry officials have come up with a new version of the warning that 's fair to both genders : " to find out about risks and side-effect , read the leaflet , get medical advice and ask your apotheker or apothekerin . " industry opposition since companies are required to add the sentence to their commercials , the respective law will have to be changed : the german government is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did he get some female advice before taking all of these ?
pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

they call bread the staff of life and indeed , germans would have a very hard living without it . in many countries , the local bakery or the bread aisle at the supermarket might carry a couple of different kinds of bread : there 's the ubiquitous white , the brownish whole wheat , and maybe a baguette if you 're lucky . walk into a german bakery , though , and prepare to be astounded by the sheer number of different doughy products on the shelves .
there 's dark rye , light rye , white bread , black bread , müsli rolls , vegetable bread , potato bread , whole wheat , etc , etc .
the varieties run the gamut , from light-and-fluffy white to nuanced mixed-grain breads to ultra-heavy black breads with a consistency approaching that of a brick . " in addition , you get the trendy breads that come out every year .
this year , low carb is the big thing , " said bernhard rott , head of the baker 's guild in the city of bonn .
" in germany , everything is turned into bread , so we have such things as carrot bread and herb bread .
you 'll find it all here . " bakeries galore all those breads need bakeries to bake and sell them , and germany has risen to the occasion .
there are more than 18,000 companies dealing in the doughy stuff , with their countless outlets that feature on nearly every german street corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one type of bakery that is popping up more often these days are the organic ones , since germans are showing an increasing interest in buying healthy foods . " germans have a strong affinity to organically grown foods , and bakeries are typically german , " said andrew murphy " if there 's one place in the world to open an organic bakery , germany is it . " medieval tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bernd the bread " has his own hit show .
why the german passionate love affair with the loaf ?
indeed , a children 's show featuring a grumpy , talking loaf called bernd -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it 's a hit with adults . experts say that mystery is not easily solved , since it 's shrouded behind medieval mists .
however , historians think that medieval guilds did play a large part in making bread one of the most beloved of foods . " the guilds not only controlled the price of baked goods , but its quality as well , " said andrea fadani , head of a bread museum in ulm - perhaps particularly german institution .
" out of that , a taste developed and you could say bread entered the overall culture . " it 's stayed there . love it dark although germans will eat almost any kind of bread , the dark varieties are particularly popular .
tourists may turn up their noses at the sight of almost-black breads darkening the bakery shelves , but for the germans , the darker the better , it seems .
rye is considered something akin to nectar of the gods , and german bakers are virtuosos with the grain . " we have a special relationship to dark breads , " said fadani .
" rye is easy to cultivate and does n't need outstanding soil types . " according to bernhard rott of the bakers ' guild , it 's not easy to bake with rye , but then again he said , german bakers are celebrated around the world for their yeasty talents and are in high demand . " it 's amazing what they can accomplish with just a little mix of wheat and rye , " he said . irène bluche -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de give us our daily bernd forget claudia schiffer , boris becker and marlene dietrich , germany has a new star .

but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.03.2005 opinion : carrot and stick for iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are iranians turning a blind eye to eu and us threats ?
while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .

pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .

far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "

' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .

the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.03.2005 opinion : carrot and stick for iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are iranians turning a blind eye to eu and us threats ?
while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- iran signs russian nuclear deal iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development .

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .
cooperating with the society for german language , ministry officials have come up with a new version of the warning that 's fair to both genders : " to find out about risks and side-effect , read the leaflet , get medical advice and ask your apotheker or apothekerin . " industry opposition since companies are required to add the sentence to their commercials , the respective law will have to be changed : the german government is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did he get some female advice before taking all of these ?
pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

but travel agencies have some aces up their sleeves . back in the good old days , booking a holiday was so simple .
there was the trip to the travel agency , the brochures to flick through , the enlightened moment when the ideal all-inclusive hotel on the spanish coast revealed itself and the whole deal was then booked by the friendly assistant .
but now , in the age of the internet , there is just too much choice ! this lament is not a common one , least of all from germans who have taken to internet booking like an englishman to a spanish beach bar .
this year alone , 30 percent of all germans questioned by the polling institute forsa say that they will use the internet to book their vacation . the poll , taken and published in advance of the international tourism fair , which runs from march 11-15 in berlin , shows a increase in online booking , up from 27 percent of germans in 2004 .
internet booking is starting to boom with the wide selection of information , offers and outlets available at the click of a mouse . half of all reservations over web by 2013 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism experts calculate that internet reservations will make up 50 percent of all holiday bookings within the next six to eight years .
recent figures from the united states seem to confirm this trend .
in the us , 65 percent of all flight tickets are booked on the web , with 20 percent dealt with by call centers and only 15 percent by travel agencies . customers are increasingly looking to book their holidays without the hassle .

unlike travel agencies , booking online keeps no one waiting in a queue to check with the agent for availability . however , nicole habrich of the german tourism federation -lrb- dtv -rrb- is convinced that the new trend will not see the demise of word-of-mouth travel information , even if the agencies are not the ones to benefit .
on the contrary , habrich believes that experiences shared with friends and family will actually play a greater role in future holiday planning . travel agencies sceptical of figures stephan busch , president of the german federation of mid-range travel enterprises -lrb- asr -rrb- , is even more sceptical that internet booking will do serious damage to the travel agency business .
he believes the increasing numbers of internet reservations are " relative " and wonders what the true relation is between those who search online and those who actually make reservations using the point-and-click method . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : busch is of the opinion that the internet can not offer what human contact can : the look in the eye and the tone of voice which emphasizes the seriousness of the once-in-a-lifetime offer .
many people , he says , will go to a travel agency in these cases to confirm whether an online booking is actually for real and then will book there and then . lufthansa 's zero commission a factor busch thinks the actual problem travel agencies suffer from is in fact the cutting of ticket commissions by germany 's national carrier lufthansa in september 2004 .
the money lost by travel agencies through the withdrawal of ticket sales commissions has had to be recouped from customers through higher prices leading to disgruntled clients trawling the web for bargains . the german travel agent and tour operator federation 's -lrb- drv -rrb- issued a complaint against lufthansa but the date for the hearing has been delayed .
busch told dw-world that the asr was considering its own complaint . the package tour remains a german favorite experts believe that internet booking is also having an adverse effect on package tours since individual travel arrangements are becoming more popular with mix-and-match or ' modular construction ' online booking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : busch , however , still believes that the package tour market remains an important and strong one in the travel industry .
he trusts the results of the research group vacation and traveling , which reported in 2004 that a clear majority of germans - 67 percent - prefer package tours . " the germans are not the travel world champions because they are travel-mad , but because the industry has got a qualitatively good product at its disposal with the package tour , " busch said .
the german consumer often believes they are saving money with the all inclusive deal over the so-called modular construction package , he said . however , busch had words of warning : " a modular construction can be a sensible option when everything is booked through one supplier but if i book the flight with one outlet , the hotel with another , no connection exists .
this often leads to complications and , ultimately , unhappiness . "

but travel agencies have some aces up their sleeves . back in the good old days , booking a holiday was so simple .
there was the trip to the travel agency , the brochures to flick through , the enlightened moment when the ideal all-inclusive hotel on the spanish coast revealed itself and the whole deal was then booked by the friendly assistant .
but now , in the age of the internet , there is just too much choice ! this lament is not a common one , least of all from germans who have taken to internet booking like an englishman to a spanish beach bar .
this year alone , 30 percent of all germans questioned by the polling institute forsa say that they will use the internet to book their vacation . the poll , taken and published in advance of the international tourism fair , which runs from march 11-15 in berlin , shows a increase in online booking , up from 27 percent of germans in 2004 .
internet booking is starting to boom with the wide selection of information , offers and outlets available at the click of a mouse . half of all reservations over web by 2013 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism experts calculate that internet reservations will make up 50 percent of all holiday bookings within the next six to eight years .
recent figures from the united states seem to confirm this trend .
in the us , 65 percent of all flight tickets are booked on the web , with 20 percent dealt with by call centers and only 15 percent by travel agencies . customers are increasingly looking to book their holidays without the hassle .
and the internet provides .
unlike travel agencies , booking online keeps no one waiting in a queue to check with the agent for availability . however , nicole habrich of the german tourism federation -lrb- dtv -rrb- is convinced that the new trend will not see the demise of word-of-mouth travel information , even if the agencies are not the ones to benefit .
on the contrary , habrich believes that experiences shared with friends and family will actually play a greater role in future holiday planning . travel agencies sceptical of figures stephan busch , president of the german federation of mid-range travel enterprises -lrb- asr -rrb- , is even more sceptical that internet booking will do serious damage to the travel agency business .
he believes the increasing numbers of internet reservations are " relative " and wonders what the true relation is between those who search online and those who actually make reservations using the point-and-click method . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : busch is of the opinion that the internet can not offer what human contact can : the look in the eye and the tone of voice which emphasizes the seriousness of the once-in-a-lifetime offer .
many people , he says , will go to a travel agency in these cases to confirm whether an online booking is actually for real and then will book there and then . lufthansa 's zero commission a factor busch thinks the actual problem travel agencies suffer from is in fact the cutting of ticket commissions by germany 's national carrier lufthansa in september 2004 .
the money lost by travel agencies through the withdrawal of ticket sales commissions has had to be recouped from customers through higher prices leading to disgruntled clients trawling the web for bargains . the german travel agent and tour operator federation 's -lrb- drv -rrb- issued a complaint against lufthansa but the date for the hearing has been delayed .
busch told dw-world that the asr was considering its own complaint . the package tour remains a german favorite experts believe that internet booking is also having an adverse effect on package tours since individual travel arrangements are becoming more popular with mix-and-match or ' modular construction ' online booking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : busch , however , still believes that the package tour market remains an important and strong one in the travel industry .
he trusts the results of the research group vacation and traveling , which reported in 2004 that a clear majority of germans - 67 percent - prefer package tours . " the germans are not the travel world champions because they are travel-mad , but because the industry has got a qualitatively good product at its disposal with the package tour , " busch said .
the german consumer often believes they are saving money with the all inclusive deal over the so-called modular construction package , he said . however , busch had words of warning : " a modular construction can be a sensible option when everything is booked through one supplier but if i book the flight with one outlet , the hotel with another , no connection exists .
this often leads to complications and , ultimately , unhappiness . "
for these reasons , he added , the tourism industry would have to face a very bleak future to give up package tours . julia elvers -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling terror threats to tourism germany 's biggest tourism company wants to show it cares more about terrorism concerns than others .

they call bread the staff of life and indeed , germans would have a very hard living without it . in many countries , the local bakery or the bread aisle at the supermarket might carry a couple of different kinds of bread : there 's the ubiquitous white , the brownish whole wheat , and maybe a baguette if you 're lucky . walk into a german bakery , though , and prepare to be astounded by the sheer number of different doughy products on the shelves .
there 's dark rye , light rye , white bread , black bread , müsli rolls , vegetable bread , potato bread , whole wheat , etc , etc .
the varieties run the gamut , from light-and-fluffy white to nuanced mixed-grain breads to ultra-heavy black breads with a consistency approaching that of a brick . " in addition , you get the trendy breads that come out every year .
this year , low carb is the big thing , " said bernhard rott , head of the baker 's guild in the city of bonn .
" in germany , everything is turned into bread , so we have such things as carrot bread and herb bread .
you 'll find it all here . " bakeries galore all those breads need bakeries to bake and sell them , and germany has risen to the occasion .
there are more than 18,000 companies dealing in the doughy stuff , with their countless outlets that feature on nearly every german street corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one type of bakery that is popping up more often these days are the organic ones , since germans are showing an increasing interest in buying healthy foods . " germans have a strong affinity to organically grown foods , and bakeries are typically german , " said andrew murphy " if there 's one place in the world to open an organic bakery , germany is it . " medieval tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bernd the bread " has his own hit show .
why the german passionate love affair with the loaf ?
indeed , a children 's show featuring a grumpy , talking loaf called bernd -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it 's a hit with adults . experts say that mystery is not easily solved , since it 's shrouded behind medieval mists .
however , historians think that medieval guilds did play a large part in making bread one of the most beloved of foods . " the guilds not only controlled the price of baked goods , but its quality as well , " said andrea fadani , head of a bread museum in ulm - perhaps particularly german institution .
" out of that , a taste developed and you could say bread entered the overall culture . " it 's stayed there . love it dark although germans will eat almost any kind of bread , the dark varieties are particularly popular .
tourists may turn up their noses at the sight of almost-black breads darkening the bakery shelves , but for the germans , the darker the better , it seems .
rye is considered something akin to nectar of the gods , and german bakers are virtuosos with the grain . " we have a special relationship to dark breads , " said fadani .
" rye is easy to cultivate and does n't need outstanding soil types . " according to bernhard rott of the bakers ' guild , it 's not easy to bake with rye , but then again he said , german bakers are celebrated around the world for their yeasty talents and are in high demand . " it 's amazing what they can accomplish with just a little mix of wheat and rye , " he said . irène bluche -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de give us our daily bernd forget claudia schiffer , boris becker and marlene dietrich , germany has a new star .

but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .

although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .

but travel agencies have some aces up their sleeves . back in the good old days , booking a holiday was so simple .
there was the trip to the travel agency , the brochures to flick through , the enlightened moment when the ideal all-inclusive hotel on the spanish coast revealed itself and the whole deal was then booked by the friendly assistant .
but now , in the age of the internet , there is just too much choice ! this lament is not a common one , least of all from germans who have taken to internet booking like an englishman to a spanish beach bar .
this year alone , 30 percent of all germans questioned by the polling institute forsa say that they will use the internet to book their vacation . the poll , taken and published in advance of the international tourism fair , which runs from march 11-15 in berlin , shows a increase in online booking , up from 27 percent of germans in 2004 .
internet booking is starting to boom with the wide selection of information , offers and outlets available at the click of a mouse . half of all reservations over web by 2013 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourism experts calculate that internet reservations will make up 50 percent of all holiday bookings within the next six to eight years .
recent figures from the united states seem to confirm this trend .

but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "

far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "

in sweden and many other countries , studies have shown that people with arabic sounding names had a reduced chance of being invited for a job interview , despite having the same qualifications as other applicants , the report said .

" the rise of right-populist parties has a had a distinct impact on debate about immigration and integration issues in the eu . "
far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .

" industry opposition since companies are required to add the sentence to their commercials , the respective law will have to be changed : the german government is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did he get some female advice before taking all of these ?
pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "

" the rise of right-populist parties has a had a distinct impact on debate about immigration and integration issues in the eu . "
far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist .

pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children outside a muslim school that was bombed in the netherlands the report by the international helsinki federation , a group of 44 human rights ngos that aims to uphold human rights standards , said the 2004 french law prohibiting religious attire in public schools helped encourage discrimination against muslim women .
in sweden and many other countries , studies have shown that people with arabic sounding names had a reduced chance of being invited for a job interview , despite having the same qualifications as other applicants , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard at a paris mosque the report also took the media and right-wing and conservative parties to task .
they have reinforced patterns of prejudice against muslims , rhodes said .
" media accounts very often use stereotypical and negative one-dimensional language and they tend to contribute to a popular perception of muslims as aliens or dangerous , " he said .
" the rise of right-populist parties has a had a distinct impact on debate about immigration and integration issues in the eu . "
far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim woman during a protest outside the french embassy in edinburgh , scotland against the french decision to ban headscarves in schools such discrimination could encourage moderate muslims to join extreme groups in order to protect their cultural and religious identity , rhodes said .
" they challenge the moderate parts of these communities and they sometimes divide them and threaten them , " he said .
" and the terrorist agenda - which is to obviously create terror - is also to polarize society and generate fear .
when that is allowed to happen then the terrorists are winning .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children outside a muslim school that was bombed in the netherlands the report by the international helsinki federation , a group of 44 human rights ngos that aims to uphold human rights standards , said the 2004 french law prohibiting religious attire in public schools helped encourage discrimination against muslim women .
in sweden and many other countries , studies have shown that people with arabic sounding names had a reduced chance of being invited for a job interview , despite having the same qualifications as other applicants , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard at a paris mosque the report also took the media and right-wing and conservative parties to task .
they have reinforced patterns of prejudice against muslims , rhodes said .
" media accounts very often use stereotypical and negative one-dimensional language and they tend to contribute to a popular perception of muslims as aliens or dangerous , " he said .
" the rise of right-populist parties has a had a distinct impact on debate about immigration and integration issues in the eu . "
far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .

" they challenge the moderate parts of these communities and they sometimes divide them and threaten them , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.03.2005 france wants anthem taught in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm so tired of practicing the marseillaise " a bill currently in front of parliament in france would make learning the national anthem , the marseillaise , part of the school curriculum .
but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .
too few , he said , are familiar with the song and its lyrics . violence and gore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- left -rrb- rewiewing the troops on national day in 2004 the marseillaise was composed by claude joseph rouget de lisle , a military captain , in 1792 when france was at war with austria .
the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .
it 's the opposite of what we are trying to teach them in our society , " he said .
" these words are at the very least shocking and at worst can be misunderstood . " historical context but supporters of teaching the song , like 19-year-old oliver decaux , who himself can hum a few bars but who does n't know the words , think it is necessary to look at the lyrics in their historical context .
although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .
" it 's a song from the french revolution and i find the words beautiful and poetic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high school students shout slogans during a demonstration to protest against government plans to reform the education system in paris on tuesday some artists have already tinkered with the lyrics , such as the legendary singer serge gainsbourg , who came up with a reggae version of the anthem in which he made fun of the martial imagery .
his version became a hit , but angered many people , including military supporters who disrupted some of the musician 's concerts .
perhaps they took the song 's call to heart . hurry to your manly tone so that in death your enemies see your triumph and our glory !

they call bread the staff of life and indeed , germans would have a very hard living without it . in many countries , the local bakery or the bread aisle at the supermarket might carry a couple of different kinds of bread : there 's the ubiquitous white , the brownish whole wheat , and maybe a baguette if you 're lucky . walk into a german bakery , though , and prepare to be astounded by the sheer number of different doughy products on the shelves .
there 's dark rye , light rye , white bread , black bread , müsli rolls , vegetable bread , potato bread , whole wheat , etc , etc .
the varieties run the gamut , from light-and-fluffy white to nuanced mixed-grain breads to ultra-heavy black breads with a consistency approaching that of a brick . " in addition , you get the trendy breads that come out every year .
this year , low carb is the big thing , " said bernhard rott , head of the baker 's guild in the city of bonn .
" in germany , everything is turned into bread , so we have such things as carrot bread and herb bread .
you 'll find it all here . " bakeries galore all those breads need bakeries to bake and sell them , and germany has risen to the occasion .
there are more than 18,000 companies dealing in the doughy stuff , with their countless outlets that feature on nearly every german street corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one type of bakery that is popping up more often these days are the organic ones , since germans are showing an increasing interest in buying healthy foods . " germans have a strong affinity to organically grown foods , and bakeries are typically german , " said andrew murphy " if there 's one place in the world to open an organic bakery , germany is it . " medieval tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bernd the bread " has his own hit show .
why the german passionate love affair with the loaf ?
indeed , a children 's show featuring a grumpy , talking loaf called bernd -lrb- photo -rrb- .
it 's a hit with adults . experts say that mystery is not easily solved , since it 's shrouded behind medieval mists .
however , historians think that medieval guilds did play a large part in making bread one of the most beloved of foods . " the guilds not only controlled the price of baked goods , but its quality as well , " said andrea fadani , head of a bread museum in ulm - perhaps particularly german institution .
" out of that , a taste developed and you could say bread entered the overall culture . " it 's stayed there . love it dark although germans will eat almost any kind of bread , the dark varieties are particularly popular .
tourists may turn up their noses at the sight of almost-black breads darkening the bakery shelves , but for the germans , the darker the better , it seems .
rye is considered something akin to nectar of the gods , and german bakers are virtuosos with the grain . " we have a special relationship to dark breads , " said fadani .
" rye is easy to cultivate and does n't need outstanding soil types . " according to bernhard rott of the bakers ' guild , it 's not easy to bake with rye , but then again he said , german bakers are celebrated around the world for their yeasty talents and are in high demand . " it 's amazing what they can accomplish with just a little mix of wheat and rye , " he said . irène bluche -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de give us our daily bernd forget claudia schiffer , boris becker and marlene dietrich , germany has a new star .

but the proposal is controversial , given the song 's violent imagery . the first few bars of france 's national anthem are recognized in much of the world .
in france itself , there 's no escaping the tune , although not that many people actually know all the words . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of france 's national soccer team during the 2004 european championships in portugal jerome riviere , a member of the french parliament , would like to change that .
he has proposed an amendment to a school reform bill that would make teaching the national anthem part of the school curriculum .
he was inspired to push for the legislation after one of his nephews asked him about " that soccer song . " " to some of them , it is just a sports song , " he said .
" it is much more , and i think it is important that they know that . " according to him , the song can teach children about values of liberty , freedom and fraternity which were fought for in the french revolution .

the song he composed , originally called the " war song for the rhine army , " was meant to motivate the troops .
but that summer , revolutionary soldiers from marseilles sang the song as they entered paris and it has been known as the marseillaise ever since . despite the french 's love for the song , or at least the tune , the lyrics are still somewhat controversial .
the marseillaise is essentially a war song with violent imagery , such as those in the first verse . arise children of the fatherland the day of glory has arrived against us tyranny 's bloody standard is raised listen to the sound in the fields the howling of these fearsome soldiers they are coming into our midst to cut the throats of your sons and consorts part of the refrain calls on citizens to let " impure blood water our furrows , " words which have caused many to question the appropriateness of teaching those words to children in 21st century , multi-cultural france . " how do you expect eight-year-old children to understand the notion of ' impure blood ' ? " asked pierre-louis fagniez , a member of parliament for the right-of-center ump party .
he supports the drive to teach the marseillaise in schools , but thinks the lyrics should be changed , since he worries the lyrics could make the children of immigrants feel less at home in france and somehow " less french " than other kids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veiled women holding the french flag during a demonstration in paris " -lsb- the song -rsb- suggests that some people have pure blood and others have impure blood .

although politically incorrect , decaux said the " impure blood " refers to the blood of kings , who thought they were above the common people , but who were actually traitors to france . " you have to think of when the marseillaise became the national anthem , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.03.2005 tough times for muslims in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : showing allegiance to germany a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .
" and people with muslim or arab sounding names are less likely to be invited to job interviews . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and children outside a muslim school that was bombed in the netherlands the report by the international helsinki federation , a group of 44 human rights ngos that aims to uphold human rights standards , said the 2004 french law prohibiting religious attire in public schools helped encourage discrimination against muslim women .
in sweden and many other countries , studies have shown that people with arabic sounding names had a reduced chance of being invited for a job interview , despite having the same qualifications as other applicants , the report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a policeman stands guard at a paris mosque the report also took the media and right-wing and conservative parties to task .
they have reinforced patterns of prejudice against muslims , rhodes said .
" media accounts very often use stereotypical and negative one-dimensional language and they tend to contribute to a popular perception of muslims as aliens or dangerous , " he said .
" the rise of right-populist parties has a had a distinct impact on debate about immigration and integration issues in the eu . "
far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .
' islam ' equals ' terrrorism ' ?
rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .
even lobby organizations , such as animal rights groups in denmark , are calling for restriction of religious freedoms to ban islamic and jewish ritual animal sacrifice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim woman during a protest outside the french embassy in edinburgh , scotland against the french decision to ban headscarves in schools such discrimination could encourage moderate muslims to join extreme groups in order to protect their cultural and religious identity , rhodes said .
" they challenge the moderate parts of these communities and they sometimes divide them and threaten them , " he said .
" and the terrorist agenda - which is to obviously create terror - is also to polarize society and generate fear .
when that is allowed to happen then the terrorists are winning .

11 , 2001 . the international helsinki federation for human rights surveyed 11 of the 25 eu countries for its report on discrimination against muslims in europe .
it found that muslims in these countries have felt increasingly stigmatized , partly based on the current widespread fight against terrorism , and partly because of a perceived threat of religious extremism in europe .
verbal abuse , job bias helsinki federation executive director aaron rhodes said discrimination against muslims has risen as the fight against terrorism has intensified .
" they ’ re very often subjected to verbal abuse on the street and public transportation ... we found that in france 70 percent of all attacks on muslims were comprised of attacks on women wearing headscarves , " he said .

far-right parties in italy , belgium and austria depict muslim immigration as a threat to the security and values of eu countries , according to the report .

rhodes pointed out that in britain , the media have hailed the country ’ s criminal justice system for successfully prosecuting muslim terrorists , despite the fact that only three out of hundreds of muslims arrested were actually convicted .
in the netherlands , people believe that muslim schools undermine integration efforts , while in germany , 80 percent of those surveyed associated the word " islam " with " terrorism " and " oppression of women , " rhodes noted .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.03.2005 opinion : carrot and stick for iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are iranians turning a blind eye to eu and us threats ?
while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .
cooperating with the society for german language , ministry officials have come up with a new version of the warning that 's fair to both genders : " to find out about risks and side-effect , read the leaflet , get medical advice and ask your apotheker or apothekerin . " industry opposition since companies are required to add the sentence to their commercials , the respective law will have to be changed : the german government is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did he get some female advice before taking all of these ?
pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp . the eu and the us seem to have agreed on a " carrot and stick " approach as far as iran 's nuclear ambitions are concerned .
they seem to employ this tactic with changing roles : while the us so far has appeared to ready itself to attack iran , europe focused on diplomacy .
negotiating in tehran , the " eu troika , " france , britain and germany , managed to convince iran 's leaders to at least halt their uranium enrichment program . while europe has failed to give iran anything in exchange , the us now seems to make up for this by offering to end its blockade of iran 's ambitions to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- and allow iran to import spare parts for its ageing commercial airlines fleet . as washington seems to be softening , europeans are becoming more resolute .
they 're not in a hurry - " tehran wo n't do anything as long as we keep talking , " they seem to think .
but europe 's negotiators have now said they will take iran to the un security council should tehran prove to be uncooperative . newfound unity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- kisses the hand of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in luxembourg on feb .
10 while the change of roles might come as a surprise , it seems to say more about the changing relationship between the us and europe than a change in policy towards iran .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice obviously managed to find common ground , including on the subject of iran , during her latest visits to europe .
that was n't difficult as the powers on both sides of the atlantic are deeply concerned about iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons . washington meanwhile is emphasizing that the " incentives " are not meant to be understood as rewards and keeps pointing out that it will resort to different methods in a case of emergency .
such methods could range from further sanctions to a military attack . ineffective strategy even europeans do n't seem to rule out the latter categorically any longer .
washington and brussels should know , however , that taking matters to the council and - especially - military pressure wo n't do much good . for the time being , the us remains tied up in iraq and really can not afford another military adventure in the region .
a condemnation of iran 's behavior by the council is highly unlikely : china has signed far-reaching oil contracts with iran and russia has expanded its cooperation with tehran in the nuclear sector .
neither country has an interest in imposing sanctions on iran and will likely veto such a step . washington 's " incentives " are also unlikely to force tehran on a more docile course : the wto admissions process takes years and iran feels it has a right to become a member - just like it feels that it has a right to continue its uranium enrichment program . peter philipp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .
-lrb- march 11 , 2005 -rrb- iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

this includes ads for pharmaceuticals , but the government has promised to swiftly solve the problem . people voicing us drug commercials must be among the fastest speakers around .
within seconds , they have to get through a litany of possible side-effects anyone taking the medication might experience . their german counterparts have it much easier .
instead of naming potential risks , german lawmakers have so far only required pharmaceutical companies to end their commercials with a standardized sentence : " to find out about risks and side-effects , read the patient information leaflet and ask your doctor or pharmacist . " that 's your arzt oder apotheker you 're supposed to ask , leaving female ärztinnen and apothekerinnen out of the equation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " looks like a lung to me " but that 's about the change , thanks to the german ministry for families , senior citizens , women and youth , the german weekly der spiegel reported .
cooperating with the society for german language , ministry officials have come up with a new version of the warning that 's fair to both genders : " to find out about risks and side-effect , read the leaflet , get medical advice and ask your apotheker or apothekerin . " industry opposition since companies are required to add the sentence to their commercials , the respective law will have to be changed : the german government is expected to discuss the matter at a meeting in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did he get some female advice before taking all of these ?
pharmaceutical and advertising companies are opposing the change , by the way .
they 're saying the longer sentence will be less effective as a warning message and are also afraid that druggists - male and female - might now also want to be included . not to mention doctors , who - for the greater good of gender equality - have been reduced to " medical advice .

a 20-year-old man became the first volunteer to receive the vaccine on saturday .
he will be followed by seven others , four of whom are women .
a total of 49 volunteers aged between 18 and 50 will take part in the tests to be carried out over three stages , officials were quoted as saying .
china says 840,000 people have hiv but experts fear the figure is higher .
the first stage of the test will last 14 months , chen ji , director of the disease control agency in southern china 's guangxi region , was quoted by xinhua as saying .
no details on the test were given , but the second stage would cover " immune nature and safety of the vaccine " .
all of those taking part in the tests have received physical check-ups and signed waivers , xinhua said .
the tests were approved by china 's drug regulators last november .
the chinese government says 80,000 of its 1.3 billion population have developed full-blown aids .
the un has warned that the number of people affected by hiv and aids in china could rise to 10 million by 2010 unless much is done to fight the disease .
more than 43 million people around the world have been infected by the hiv / aids virus and around 25 million people died .
human trials of vaccines are being carried out in several countries but none have yet proved to be significantly effective against the disease .

road signs are being erected as thousands of awakening toads get ready to migrate to breeding ponds .
cumbria wildlife trust fears many may be killed as they use regular routes - most which include a cross-road trip .
the road signs will be in place until may , as the animals instinctively follow centuries old routes straight across busy roads .
david harpley , senior conservation manager at cumbria wildlife trust , said : " the reason there is a problem is because toads breed in ponds .
" but they spend the rest of their time in the surrounding countryside hunting slugs and obviously they have to get between the two .
so particularly around breeding time , they risk getting squashed .
spawning ponds " toads are very particular about their breeding site and will head for one specific body of water , even if it means passing others along the way .
" warning signs are in place at busy toad crossing points on our roads and in some places volunteers have built special underpasses or even spent time physically carrying toads across the road . "
toad populations are in decline across the uk , and so information on the location of spawning ponds , hibernation places and the migration routes is vital .
part of the reason for this decline is that many toads become homeless each year as wild ponds are lost due to road building , development , pollution , intensive farming and drought .
the common toad has not adapted as well to garden ponds as the common frog , as they need deeper water to spawn successfully .
there are road signs warning drivers to look out for toads at various crossing locations around the county including lindale road , grange-over-sands ; dubs lane at sawrey ; loughrigg tarn near ambleside ; portinscale near keswick and on the eaglesfield to brandlingill road near cockermouth .
