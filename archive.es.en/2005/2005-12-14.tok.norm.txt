" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday .

otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .
otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked .

" no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight .

" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .

64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .

according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.12.2005 germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president says the holocaust is a myth the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . he described the hardline president 's remarks denying the holocaust and suggesting israel should be relocated to europe as " shocking and totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .
" be certain that if you do that , the iranian people will no longer protest against you and will support your decision . " anti-israel onslaught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians filled the streets of tehran in an anti-israeli rally in october the iranian president has already sparked international outrage over a string of anti-israeli outbursts .
in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive . "
" i lost my sister and several other relatives in the holocaust .
words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .
on tuesday , he accused europe of preventing any such investigation which he said would " clear up any open questions .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .

64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

grabbing hold of his sack of presents , they beat him over the head , breaking his altruistic fingers as he tried to protect himself . stettler says there 's a glint of something in crazed shoppers ' eyes around this time of year which makes it obvious they are on a short fuse .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .
" this will be saturation then , " said rüter . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

tis the season to be jolly , fa la la la la … not if you 're a curmudgeonly shopper in the german city of wiesbaden . at the very latest when bad sa n ta aka billy bob thornton hit the silver screen in time for last year 's festive season , the public was forced to acknowledge that the tubby guys in the fur-trimmed red suits did n't all grow up with the fairies and the elves . but that said , for the more benevolent of the seasonal santas , donning a ruddy ruby disguise in order to take center stage in makeshift department store grottos across the western world each december is a chance to fulfil the fantasies of the young and naïve .
and the truly dedicated , might even try to apply the magic " ho , ho , ho " to the older and less gullible . such was the case with a certain father christmas in the western german city of wiesbaden .
reluctant to return to his normal guise of a 31-year-old man , stefan stettler was still in costume as he waited for his evening train home .
not content with having spent a whole day putting smiles on children 's faces , he killed time on the platform by trying to inject a note of the festive spirit into his fellow passengers . here 's o n e for you , mr sa n ta claus ... when he asked two men to " tell santa what they would like for christmas , " they responded by giving him a unusual " for the man who has everything " gift .
grabbing hold of his sack of presents , they beat him over the head , breaking his altruistic fingers as he tried to protect himself . stettler says there 's a glint of something in crazed shoppers ' eyes around this time of year which makes it obvious they are on a short fuse . " i should have know better but come on , who beats up santa claus ?

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .
otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .
and with tense negotiations planned for thursday and friday this week , time is running out for a resolution before britain ’ s presidency ends in january . more aid for new states but rebate is off the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair and jack straw have drawn a line in the eu sand britain 's original package issued last week was almost unanimously rejected , and british officials announced at the start of this week that the second draft would be little different from the first which proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years . the latest package offered only a slight restoration of aid cut from the new east european members , a modest reinstatement of rural development funds for western europe and added 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.01 billion -rrb- to overall spending , raising it to 849.3 billion euros or 1.03 percent of eu output from 1.026 percent in last week 's proposal . there was no mention of reducing the annual british refund to meet a share of the costs of the bloc 's eastward enlargement which leaves open one of the most contentious issues for the 25 leaders at the coming summit . " we remain convinced that these proposals are good for britain and good for europe and offer a sound basis for agreement at this week 's european council , " british foreign minister jack straw said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain tells eu to expect no surprises as budget crisis looms as eu foreign ministers met for the final time before their make-or-break summit this week , the fractious bloc looked no closer to coming up with a proposal for the eu budget which would satisfy everyone .

the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday .

otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

but these days , publishers are pulling out the stops in their efforts to make books beautiful . what 's velvet and smells of lavender ?
what 's studded with small mirrors and embroidered with gold ?
believe it not - books ! the festive season has seen the publishing world throw understatement to the winds and enter into the christmas spirit with a vengeance .
there was a time when books were considered a last bastion of intellectual integrity in the face of consumer excess , but these days , a complementary cd is the least the discerning consumer expects when buying a book . sensory stimulation publishers have decided that it 's high time reading matter delighted as many senses as possible , and according to publishing consultant andreas meyer , " polysensual branding is a major consumer trend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion-conscious book-lovers should know that white pages are totally passé so just as busy professionals across the country are starting to panic about what to buy their mother-in-law for christmas , the rowohlt verlag publishing house has launched a limited edition series of eight classics that are specifically designed to be bought as gifts .
with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .
" who can resist the sound of an antique book 's pages rustling ? " he admitted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german publishers warm to google library google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .

a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.12.2005 latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honduras and panama have led the challenge to the banana policy latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce . mario jimenez , honduras ' agriculture minister , also said it was hard to see how the wto 's doha round trade liberalization talks can advance unless brussels changes tack .
one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .
" be certain that if you do that , the iranian people will no longer protest against you and will support your decision .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

" i lost my sister and several other relatives in the holocaust .
words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .
" this will be saturation then , " said rüter . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

tis the season to be jolly , fa la la la la … not if you 're a curmudgeonly shopper in the german city of wiesbaden . at the very latest when bad sa n ta aka billy bob thornton hit the silver screen in time for last year 's festive season , the public was forced to acknowledge that the tubby guys in the fur-trimmed red suits did n't all grow up with the fairies and the elves . but that said , for the more benevolent of the seasonal santas , donning a ruddy ruby disguise in order to take center stage in makeshift department store grottos across the western world each december is a chance to fulfil the fantasies of the young and naïve .
and the truly dedicated , might even try to apply the magic " ho , ho , ho " to the older and less gullible . such was the case with a certain father christmas in the western german city of wiesbaden .
reluctant to return to his normal guise of a 31-year-old man , stefan stettler was still in costume as he waited for his evening train home .
not content with having spent a whole day putting smiles on children 's faces , he killed time on the platform by trying to inject a note of the festive spirit into his fellow passengers . here 's o n e for you , mr sa n ta claus ... when he asked two men to " tell santa what they would like for christmas , " they responded by giving him a unusual " for the man who has everything " gift .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .
otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .
" this will be saturation then , " said rüter . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .

but these days , publishers are pulling out the stops in their efforts to make books beautiful . what 's velvet and smells of lavender ?
what 's studded with small mirrors and embroidered with gold ?
believe it not - books ! the festive season has seen the publishing world throw understatement to the winds and enter into the christmas spirit with a vengeance .
there was a time when books were considered a last bastion of intellectual integrity in the face of consumer excess , but these days , a complementary cd is the least the discerning consumer expects when buying a book . sensory stimulation publishers have decided that it 's high time reading matter delighted as many senses as possible , and according to publishing consultant andreas meyer , " polysensual branding is a major consumer trend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion-conscious book-lovers should know that white pages are totally passé so just as busy professionals across the country are starting to panic about what to buy their mother-in-law for christmas , the rowohlt verlag publishing house has launched a limited edition series of eight classics that are specifically designed to be bought as gifts .
with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .
and with tense negotiations planned for thursday and friday this week , time is running out for a resolution before britain ’ s presidency ends in january . more aid for new states but rebate is off the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair and jack straw have drawn a line in the eu sand britain 's original package issued last week was almost unanimously rejected , and british officials announced at the start of this week that the second draft would be little different from the first which proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years . the latest package offered only a slight restoration of aid cut from the new east european members , a modest reinstatement of rural development funds for western europe and added 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.01 billion -rrb- to overall spending , raising it to 849.3 billion euros or 1.03 percent of eu output from 1.026 percent in last week 's proposal . there was no mention of reducing the annual british refund to meet a share of the costs of the bloc 's eastward enlargement which leaves open one of the most contentious issues for the 25 leaders at the coming summit . " we remain convinced that these proposals are good for britain and good for europe and offer a sound basis for agreement at this week 's european council , " british foreign minister jack straw said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain tells eu to expect no surprises as budget crisis looms as eu foreign ministers met for the final time before their make-or-break summit this week , the fractious bloc looked no closer to coming up with a proposal for the eu budget which would satisfy everyone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.12.2005 latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honduras and panama have led the challenge to the banana policy latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce . mario jimenez , honduras ' agriculture minister , also said it was hard to see how the wto 's doha round trade liberalization talks can advance unless brussels changes tack .
one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .

steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .
" be certain that if you do that , the iranian people will no longer protest against you and will support your decision . " anti-israel onslaught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians filled the streets of tehran in an anti-israeli rally in october the iranian president has already sparked international outrage over a string of anti-israeli outbursts .
in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive . "
" i lost my sister and several other relatives in the holocaust .
words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .
on tuesday , he accused europe of preventing any such investigation which he said would " clear up any open questions .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .
" be certain that if you do that , the iranian people will no longer protest against you and will support your decision . " anti-israel onslaught bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranians filled the streets of tehran in an anti-israeli rally in october the iranian president has already sparked international outrage over a string of anti-israeli outbursts .
in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive . "
" i lost my sister and several other relatives in the holocaust .
words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight .

eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .

eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient .

otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .

signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .

according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade .

yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .
and with tense negotiations planned for thursday and friday this week , time is running out for a resolution before britain ’ s presidency ends in january . more aid for new states but rebate is off the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair and jack straw have drawn a line in the eu sand britain 's original package issued last week was almost unanimously rejected , and british officials announced at the start of this week that the second draft would be little different from the first which proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years . the latest package offered only a slight restoration of aid cut from the new east european members , a modest reinstatement of rural development funds for western europe and added 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.01 billion -rrb- to overall spending , raising it to 849.3 billion euros or 1.03 percent of eu output from 1.026 percent in last week 's proposal . there was no mention of reducing the annual british refund to meet a share of the costs of the bloc 's eastward enlargement which leaves open one of the most contentious issues for the 25 leaders at the coming summit . " we remain convinced that these proposals are good for britain and good for europe and offer a sound basis for agreement at this week 's european council , " british foreign minister jack straw said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain tells eu to expect no surprises as budget crisis looms as eu foreign ministers met for the final time before their make-or-break summit this week , the fractious bloc looked no closer to coming up with a proposal for the eu budget which would satisfy everyone .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .
otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

but these days , publishers are pulling out the stops in their efforts to make books beautiful . what 's velvet and smells of lavender ?
what 's studded with small mirrors and embroidered with gold ?
believe it not - books ! the festive season has seen the publishing world throw understatement to the winds and enter into the christmas spirit with a vengeance .
there was a time when books were considered a last bastion of intellectual integrity in the face of consumer excess , but these days , a complementary cd is the least the discerning consumer expects when buying a book . sensory stimulation publishers have decided that it 's high time reading matter delighted as many senses as possible , and according to publishing consultant andreas meyer , " polysensual branding is a major consumer trend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion-conscious book-lovers should know that white pages are totally passé so just as busy professionals across the country are starting to panic about what to buy their mother-in-law for christmas , the rowohlt verlag publishing house has launched a limited edition series of eight classics that are specifically designed to be bought as gifts .
with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .

but these days , publishers are pulling out the stops in their efforts to make books beautiful . what 's velvet and smells of lavender ?
what 's studded with small mirrors and embroidered with gold ?
believe it not - books ! the festive season has seen the publishing world throw understatement to the winds and enter into the christmas spirit with a vengeance .
there was a time when books were considered a last bastion of intellectual integrity in the face of consumer excess , but these days , a complementary cd is the least the discerning consumer expects when buying a book . sensory stimulation publishers have decided that it 's high time reading matter delighted as many senses as possible , and according to publishing consultant andreas meyer , " polysensual branding is a major consumer trend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion-conscious book-lovers should know that white pages are totally passé so just as busy professionals across the country are starting to panic about what to buy their mother-in-law for christmas , the rowohlt verlag publishing house has launched a limited edition series of eight classics that are specifically designed to be bought as gifts .
with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .
" who can resist the sound of an antique book 's pages rustling ? " he admitted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german publishers warm to google library google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .

but these days , publishers are pulling out the stops in their efforts to make books beautiful . what 's velvet and smells of lavender ?
what 's studded with small mirrors and embroidered with gold ?
believe it not - books ! the festive season has seen the publishing world throw understatement to the winds and enter into the christmas spirit with a vengeance .
there was a time when books were considered a last bastion of intellectual integrity in the face of consumer excess , but these days , a complementary cd is the least the discerning consumer expects when buying a book . sensory stimulation publishers have decided that it 's high time reading matter delighted as many senses as possible , and according to publishing consultant andreas meyer , " polysensual branding is a major consumer trend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion-conscious book-lovers should know that white pages are totally passé so just as busy professionals across the country are starting to panic about what to buy their mother-in-law for christmas , the rowohlt verlag publishing house has launched a limited edition series of eight classics that are specifically designed to be bought as gifts .
with their slinky covers , the paperbacks are aimed at what lisa berger from rowohlt describes as " educated readers " with a healthy appreciation of luxury and " an above-average income " - even though she points out that they cost barely more than standard issue books . children 's books , meanwhile , positively cry out for maximum sensory stimulation .
glittery stars , reliefs and pop-ups have become an integral part of the picture book market , and have never been more popular .
and in terms of paper quality and printing , german books enjoy an excellent reputation . art publisher weingarten has come up with calendars scented with lavender , herbs , spices or even coffee , while the highlight of hamburg-based hoffmann und campe 's christmas list is a collector 's item for all bob dylan fans - called " scrapbook , " it features copies of concert tickets , hand-written notes and vintage flyers . unique selling points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : velvet covers or cds ?
anything to please the customer !
marebuch verlag has come up trumps with mini cds bundled with collected poems by john updike featuring the writer reading his work himself - a publishing coup , considering updike is famously reluctant to read in public . another perfect christmas gift is " venice " by armin mueller-stahl , published in a special edition complete with original illustrations by the german actor himself . reflecting a trend to publish books with audio accompaniments , anyone who buys osanna vaughn 's fantasy fiction " falcon sight " gets a complementary cd featuring a specially-composed soundtrack to the book , while the adventures of detective john chatterton published by the frankfurt moritz verlag come with a cd of cool saxaphone sounds . " buyers are not just reading machines , " said tom erben , ceo of the aufbau publishing group .
" they 're people who enjoy appreciating books with all their senses . " even so , he recognizes that even an old-fashioned book has its charm .
" who can resist the sound of an antique book 's pages rustling ? " he admitted . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german publishers warm to google library google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.12.2005 latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honduras and panama have led the challenge to the banana policy latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce . mario jimenez , honduras ' agriculture minister , also said it was hard to see how the wto 's doha round trade liberalization talks can advance unless brussels changes tack .
one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .
" be certain that if you do that , the iranian people will no longer protest against you and will support your decision .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .

in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday . " we are expecting further information and are not yet in a position to offer a conclusive evaluation of the situation , " said werner hoyer , foreign policy spokesperson for the free-market liberal party fdp . both steinmeier and schäuble have already denied any involvement in the abduction of el masri .
otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

" the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

one goal of the 149-nation negotiations is to use freer trade to give developing countries an economic boost . " honduras requests that this ministerial conference condemn these new eu measures and work with us over the ensuing days of the conference to ensure that they are not installed , " jimenez said .
" if these eu actions are tolerated , if our requests for support and solidarity are met with a collaborative silence , the round , the wto system , and our developing-economy interests will be the biggest losers , " he said . jimenez was backed by counterparts from brazil , costa rica , colombia , ecuador , nicaragua and panama - who said their banana growers would suffer because eu rules would shut them out of the market - as well as the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mariann fischer boel but the eu 's agriculture chief mariann fischer boel insisted that brussels ' tariff plan was fair and that europe was not looking for a fight . " we have been sending a clear signal to the latin american countries that we will be willing to continue to negotiate with them , " fischer boel said .
" the eu has devoted considerable time this year to getting this right , " she said .
" we are quite sure it will more than maintain present possibilities for latin american countries to get into the european market . "
eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .
preferential trade eu nations have been struggling with the need to respect the wto 's decisions and pressure to maintain their preferential banana trade deal with the african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- grouping of developing countries , as well as keep growers afloat in europe 's overseas territories . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six-day wto conference in hopng kong has been accompanied by protests ministers from acp members belize , cameroon , dominica , ivory coast , jamaica and saint lucia told the hong kong conference the proposed system was fair and respected the development goals of the doha round , and that they feared the latin americans really want to crowd them out of the market . the european union had to revise its previously planned 230-euro banana tariff after the wto struck down an earlier offer , saying it was too high to allow fair competition from latin american exporters . latin american banana producers export an annual combined 3.4 million tons of bananas - or around two-thirds of total imports - to the 25-nation eu .
the first 2.2 million tons are currently covered by a quota that sets a tariff of 75 euros per ton but the rest are slapped with a tariff of 680 euros . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

eu wrangles with wto rulings last month , the eu announced a new import tariff of 176 euros -lrb- 208 dollars -rrb- per ton for bananas from latin american countries from january 2006 .
the new arrangement would replace a contested quota-tariff system that had been outlawed by the wto after it ruled in favor of earlier latin american complaints . a day later , honduras and panama , who have led the latin american challenge to the eu 's banana policy , challenged it again .
the two countries demanded consultations with the eu - the first step to a formal complaint - saying the proposed new tariff went against wto rulings and would drive bananas from latin american developing nations out of the european market . jimenez said the eu was behaving as if the wto rulings had never happened , but fischer boel said brussels was fully aware of the need to respect them .
the eu also planned to put in place a monitoring system that could adapt the tariff system if the latin americans are found to be losing out , she said . " we think this has all been done in a very transparent way , a very neutral way , " she added .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday .

otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

" the german government , the federal intelligence agency , the federal criminal police office and the federal office for protection of the constitution provided no assistance in the abduction of the german citizen masri , " steinmeier said in a speech addressing the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el masri is suing the cia last week , el masri filed a landmark lawsuit against the us central intelligence agency in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner .
the masri case has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . germany respects the rule of law the german parliament was seeking to establish how much the german government knew about a suspected cia policy of abducting and illegally transporting terror suspects across europe . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , interior minister wolfgang schäuble and justice minister brigitte zypries were questioned by lawmakers behind closed doors before the parliamentary debate .
during the debate , schäuble confirmed for the first time that his predecessor , otto schily , had been informed about the kidnapping by then us ambassador to germany dan coats in summer 2004 .
coats said the us had apologized to el masri and paid him some money , according to schäuble . numerous german newspapers quoted el masri 's lawyer as saying that his client had not received any payment . zypries said the german justice ministry first learned about the masri case in june 2004 .
according to the justice ministry , the german attorney general 's office later decided against an investigation , because evidence of a politically motivated crime was insufficient . " we did everything that was needed for a process governed by the rule of law , " zypries said . the public prosecutor 's office in munich is currently investigating the case . more answers needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more information is needed , says werner hoyer -lrb- fdp -rrb- members of the german opposition parties were not entirely satisfied with the explanations they received on wednesday .

otto schily , who was previously interior minister under former chancellor gerhard schröder , has said that he was only informed by the us authorities of el masri 's abduction after he had been released in may 2004 . " the anonymous allegation that german agents were involved in the transfer of el masri is revolting and irresponsible , " steinmeier told bild newspaper over the weekend . the opposition greens said that if the explanations given by the government about the masri case were insufficient , they would push for a full parliamentary inquiry . the foreign policy committee of the german parliament is expected to continue its hearings on thursday . credible allegations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged cia abductions are threatening transatlantic relations the level of involvement of german authorities also came under the spotlight when lawyers acting for murat kurnaz , a 23-year-old german-born turkish man , said he was questioned by germans in the us military prison in guantanamo bay where he has been held for around four years . the lawyers told die zeit newspaper in an interview to be published on thursday that the germans had questioned him about his visits to mosques in pakistan . el masri also claims he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
he said he was " hit and humiliated " during his detention and feared he would not leave the prison alive . the council of europe , a 46-member rights and democracy body , on tuesday said the allegations of secret cia prisons were credible and that the united states appeared to have illegally abducted and detained individuals and that some european governments may have colluded . a report by the body 's special investigator concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries .

" we will see no better deal this week or next year , " the official said on condition of anonymity , on the eve of an eu summit focused almost entirely on ending the impasse over the bloc 's 2007-2013 spending plans . " we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .
and with tense negotiations planned for thursday and friday this week , time is running out for a resolution before britain ’ s presidency ends in january . more aid for new states but rebate is off the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair and jack straw have drawn a line in the eu sand britain 's original package issued last week was almost unanimously rejected , and british officials announced at the start of this week that the second draft would be little different from the first which proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years . the latest package offered only a slight restoration of aid cut from the new east european members , a modest reinstatement of rural development funds for western europe and added 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.01 billion -rrb- to overall spending , raising it to 849.3 billion euros or 1.03 percent of eu output from 1.026 percent in last week 's proposal . there was no mention of reducing the annual british refund to meet a share of the costs of the bloc 's eastward enlargement which leaves open one of the most contentious issues for the 25 leaders at the coming summit . " we remain convinced that these proposals are good for britain and good for europe and offer a sound basis for agreement at this week 's european council , " british foreign minister jack straw said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain tells eu to expect no surprises as budget crisis looms as eu foreign ministers met for the final time before their make-or-break summit this week , the fractious bloc looked no closer to coming up with a proposal for the eu budget which would satisfy everyone .

" we remain convinced that these proposals remain the best basis for agreement and that there is very narrow room for negotiation , " he said , after britain put its second compromise proposal on the table for its eu partners . the announcement will have disappointed many awaiting britain 's revised proposal , none more so than german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit in her new leadership role , who had previously called for the british eu presidency to do all it could to avoid what she described as a " not unimaginable " breakdown . merkel wants budget deal but not at any price bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants britain to avoid a possibly damaging budget crisis speaking after talks in brussels with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende on tuesday , merkel said she was " waiting impatiently for the next proposal from the british presidency " to break the budget deadlock and was hoping that there would be a viable option on the table before thursday 's summit . however , the chancellor said she was not prepared to compromise unnecessarily .
" we want a result but naturally not at any price , " said merkel , who warned that failure to hammer out an agreement could throw europe into a difficult period of uncertainty .
" i believe that europe in general currently finds itself in a difficult situation and if we can not reach agreement , which is not unimaginable , then we will remain in this difficult situation , " she said . barroso attacks britain 's lack of ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso did not mince his words before the slightly modified british package was announced , european commission president jose manuel barroso went further than the german chancellor by attacking what he called britain ’ s lack of ambition .
" europe 's credibility is severely damaged when some do not put their money where their mouth is , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . " does it not concern the british presidency that the strongest supporters in this chamber of this proposal come from those who -lrb- hold -rrb- the narrow-minded , nationalistic , backward-looking vision of europe ? " he asked to applause . the 2007-2013 budget is worth more than 800 billion euros -lrb- $ 944 billion -rrb- and contains much-needed funds for the eu 's relatively poor new members , mainly from central and eastern europe . the spending plans , the first to take into account the 10 newest members , are blocked by two old issues : britain 's refusal to give up its budget rebate and france 's refusal to cut the bloc 's long-disputed farm subsidy system . in limbo for most of the year , the budget project should have been resolved at the last major summit in june , but it still remains in doubt six months on .
and with tense negotiations planned for thursday and friday this week , time is running out for a resolution before britain ’ s presidency ends in january . more aid for new states but rebate is off the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair and jack straw have drawn a line in the eu sand britain 's original package issued last week was almost unanimously rejected , and british officials announced at the start of this week that the second draft would be little different from the first which proposed a cut of 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.49 billion -rrb- or 8.5 percent in aid to poor ex-communist newcomers to the bloc and detailed a continued rise of britain ’ s own rebate over the next seven years . the latest package offered only a slight restoration of aid cut from the new east european members , a modest reinstatement of rural development funds for western europe and added 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.01 billion -rrb- to overall spending , raising it to 849.3 billion euros or 1.03 percent of eu output from 1.026 percent in last week 's proposal . there was no mention of reducing the annual british refund to meet a share of the costs of the bloc 's eastward enlargement which leaves open one of the most contentious issues for the 25 leaders at the coming summit . " we remain convinced that these proposals are good for britain and good for europe and offer a sound basis for agreement at this week 's european council , " british foreign minister jack straw said in a statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain tells eu to expect no surprises as budget crisis looms as eu foreign ministers met for the final time before their make-or-break summit this week , the fractious bloc looked no closer to coming up with a proposal for the eu budget which would satisfy everyone .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

"
steinmeier told journalists that , in the absence of the iranian ambassador , the government on monday called in iran 's charge d 'affaires in germany to signal its disapproval of the president 's latest outburst .
german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday described the iranian president 's comments as " inconceivable . "
a government spokesman said she would bring up the issue at the impending eu summit in brussels and push for a joint statement rejecting the remarks .
in a live broadcast on state iranian television , ahmadinejad accused the people of israel of having " invented a myth that jews were massacred . "
he said that " myth " is given higher priority than god , religions and the prophets . " if somebody in their country questions god , nobody says anything , but if somebody denies the myth of the massacre of jews , the zionist loudspeakers and the governments in the pay of zionism will start to scream , " he added . ahmadinejad openly proposed giving a piece of land in europe , the united states , canada or alaska " so they -lrb- the jews -rrb- can create their own state , " he said .

in october , he said israel should be " wiped off the map , " and last week he drew censure from the united nations and international condemnation when he described israel as a " tumor " that should be moved to germany or austria .
he said he did not accept the claim that adolf hitler murdered millions of jews . but his latest comments are the clearest yet that he is a denier of the holocaust - nazi germany 's systematic slaughter of an estimated six million jews between 1933 and 1945 . " if you say it is true that you massacred and burned six million jews during the second world war , if you committed this massacre , why should the palestinians pay the price , " ahmadinejad asked . " why , under the pretext of this massacre , have you come to the heart of palestine and the islamic world , " he asked .
" why have you created an artificial zionist regime ? " no illusions about regime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners at the dachau concentration camp in 1945 the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , on wednesday called ahmadinejad 's latest remarks " repulsive .

words fail one when one hears such unbearable utterances , " he told the tageszeitung according to an advance extract of its thursday edition . ahmadinejad 's statements have been condemned by individual eu states and britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , on wednesday renewed its condemnation . " the comments are wholly unacceptable and we condemn them unreservedly .
they have no place in civilised political debate , " britain 's minister for europe , douglas alexander , said in strasbourg to the applause of european parliamentarians .
earlier in the day , an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said " we hope these extremist comments by the iranian president will make the international community open its eyes and abandon any illusions about this regime . " in a move which echoes the iranian president 's comments , the spokesman for the iranian parliament , gholamali haddad adel , has called for a probe into the holocaust .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .

" they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .

signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .

yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .

ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .

but the growing popularity of debit cards also makes it more difficult to keep tabs on personal finances . cities and towns across germany are bustling with christmas shoppers at the moment .
visit any large department store , for example , and you 'll be sure to find one-third of customers pulling out their debit or credit cards to pay for those christmas gifts . the popularity of plastic payment methods is not just limited to the holiday season , though .
ehi , a cologne-based research and education institute within the retail industry , has been conducting studies on card-based payment systems for over 10 years . " we 've seen strong growth in particular in debit card use over the past decade , " said ehi 's horst rüter .
according to institute figures , 31.6 percent of the 350 billion euros -lrb- $ 420 billion -rrb- in retail sales last year were paid with debit and credit cards .
64.9 percent of consumers paid cash . in 1994 , cash payments totaled 78.7 percent of sales , with plastic payment methods amounting to only 6.2 percent . little need for credit cards while credit cards are very popular in countries such as the united states and britain , they continue to play a much smaller role in the german retail sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards have still not gained solid ground in germany their share of payment methods has risen from 3.3 percent to 5 percent over the past 10 years . rüter said this small growth was mainly due to the overdraft limit german banks offer their customers .
it allows people to overdraw their checking accounts and pay interest on this amount . " so , there 's really no need for someone to have a credit card , as the overdraft fees are only slightly higher than credit card interest rates , " said rüter . plastic makes finances less transparent although many people choose to use their debit or credit card out of convenience , this payment form does have its shortcomings . jutta büttner from north rhine-westphalia 's consumer protection agency said paying for something in cash helped keep people aware of when their money was gone .
but with card payments , they constantly needed to be doing book keeping in their heads . " you can quickly lose track of your financial situation unless you check your account balance everyday , " said büttner .
" few people do that and before you know it , you 've slipped into your overdraft and are in debt . " according to the german association of consumer protection agencies , over three million households in germany are heavily indebted .
büttner said debt was especially a risk for young people between the ages of 20 and 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the older generation is more likely to have cash in their wallet " they have grown up in a card culture and have n't learned to deal with money in a tangible sense , " said büttner .
the older generation , though , would rather pay with euros . " they prefer to have the cash in their pockets and therefore know how much money they have , " said rüter . retailers addressing customers ' needs ulrike hörchens from the german retail association hde said if retailers had a choice , they would prefer cash . " you sell your wares and get cash , " she said .
" it 's very simple . " not only that .
card-based payments cost more .
in the case of pin-based debit transactions , merchants have to pay a 0.3 percent fee or at least eight cents with each transaction .
signature-based debit purchases are free of charge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : retailers have followed consumer demands for more card-based payment rüter agreed that the retail industry would much prefer cash if the pressure from consumers were n't there .
but it 's a marketing issue , he said . " the customer is the king .
if that 's what he wants , give it to him , " said rüter . cash is here to stay the united states is probably the most card-oriented society in the world .
according to the american bankers association , us consumers now make 52 percent of their in-store purchases with a debit or credit card , compared to 33 percent with cash . although germany is far from us cash standards , it has changed over the past decade . " anyone who says germany is a cash society is wrong , " said rüter .
yet it will remain the most important payment method . " germans are very conservative in this sense , " said hde 's hörchens .
" cash is traditionally the means of payment and it will continue to be so . " rüter said ehi expected card payments to increase moderately in the next couple of years .
but in 2008 , they will reach some 40 percent .
" this will be saturation then , " said rüter . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

there is an endless stream of barges chugging along the huang pu river , between skyscrapers that simply were not there 15 years ago .
bob shead from the british consulate in the city has watched the skyline change , and with it , the growth of business opportunities in china .
" there is little doubt that the chinese economy will keep on growing - perhaps not as fast as it has in the past , but it will keep expanding , " he said .
" this is the sixth biggest economy in the world ; it could be the second biggest in a decade .
there is no doubt that as china opens up further to trade , that opportunities will increase . "
it is not just the huang pu that is clogged with traffic .
shanghai 's streets are also frequently gridlocked , as the infrastructure struggles to keep up with the pace of growth .
that growth has been fuelled by an increasingly liberal global trade regime , and labour costs a fraction of what they are in the west . "
to further those aims , invest northern ireland , the government agency responsible for business development , has opened a new office in shanghai " those are ingredients which , in northern ireland , have helped accelerate the decline of the textiles industry .
however , enterprise minister angela smyth said it was impossible to wind back the clock , and that the priority is to make the most of what china has to offer .
" the growth of this economy could be both a threat and an opportunity , but i think we should see it as an opportunity , " she said .
" we have companies here looking to trade with china ; and northern ireland is a good place for chinese companies to invest that are looking for a presence in europe . "
to further those aims , invest northern ireland , the government agency responsible for business development , has opened a new office in shanghai .
it will have a two-fold remit ; to help northern ireland companies with trade development , and to scout for inward investment prospects among the growing chinese technology sector .
meanwhile , several of the local companies taking part in the recent trade mission to china find themselves forced to exploit the same cost advantages that have put some firms from northern ireland out of business - arguing that sourcing components and raw materials in china helps protect jobs at home .
' good strategic move ' one such company is fleming agriproducts from just outside londonderry .
the firm 's managing director , george fleming , says that since they began sourcing overseas , production and employment have actually increased .
" the products we make are quite large and it would not be feasible to ship them back home , but we have been buying components such as gearboxes here for some time , " he said . "
the growing economic muscle of china has created business opportunities that could not have been envisaged a few years ago " " it helps to keep our cost base in line with our competitors .
in the past , we have bought through agents ; now we want to find a partner to supply us directly . "
some firms have jumped into the china market with both feet .
deltaprint employs 140 in a packaging business in west belfast , but has a workforce of more than 500 in a joint-venture factory outside beijing .
for joint managing director colm bradley it was a good strategic move .
" we have been here five years now ; we feel we got in at the right time , " he said .
" i think we will have turnover of around £ 15m in china this year , but you have to exercise control .
you have to come out here , and you have to know what is going on .
but the era of thinking ' will i get my money out ? ' has gone . "
the growing economic muscle of china has created business opportunities that could not have been envisaged a few years ago .
china 's growing middles-class has money , wants to travel , and is now allowed to .
tourism ireland , the promotional body for the whole of the island , recently began to dip its toe into the chinese market , by appointing a full-time representative and making a presentation to the travel trade in shanghai .
the development of china is not without its problems ; the growing gaps in wealth have created social tensions ; there remains real concerns about human rights ; the pollution that clogs shanghai 's skyline is a reminder of an environmental hangover that may have to be faced for decades to come .
however , china is on its way to becoming an economic superpower ; even thousands of miles away , little northern ireland needs to take note .

there is an endless stream of barges chugging along the huang pu river , between skyscrapers that simply were not there 15 years ago .
shanghai 's streets are also frequently gridlocked bob shead from the british consulate in the city has watched the skyline change , and with it , the growth of business opportunities in china .
" there is little doubt that the chinese economy will keep on growing - perhaps not as fast as it has in the past , but it will keep expanding , " he said .
" this is the sixth biggest economy in the world ; it could be the second biggest in a decade .
there is no doubt that as china opens up further to trade , that opportunities will increase . "
it is not just the huang pu that is clogged with traffic .
shanghai 's streets are also frequently gridlocked , as the infrastructure struggles to keep up with the pace of growth .
that growth has been fuelled by an increasingly liberal global trade regime , and labour costs a fraction of what they are in the west .
to further those aims , invest northern ireland , the government agency responsible for business development , has opened a new office in shanghai those are ingredients which , in northern ireland , have helped accelerate the decline of the textiles industry .
however , enterprise minister angela smyth said it was impossible to wind back the clock , and that the priority is to make the most of what china has to offer .
" the growth of this economy could be both a threat and an opportunity , but i think we should see it as an opportunity , " she said .
" we have companies here looking to trade with china ; and northern ireland is a good place for chinese companies to invest that are looking for a presence in europe . "
growth has been fuelled by an increasingly liberal global trade regime to further those aims , invest northern ireland , the government agency responsible for business development , has opened a new office in shanghai .
it will have a two-fold remit ; to help northern ireland companies with trade development , and to scout for inward investment prospects among the growing chinese technology sector .
meanwhile , several of the local companies taking part in the recent trade mission to china find themselves forced to exploit the same cost advantages that have put some firms from northern ireland out of business - arguing that sourcing components and raw materials in china helps protect jobs at home .
' good strategic move ' one such company is fleming agriproducts from just outside londonderry .
the firm 's managing director , george fleming , says that since they began sourcing overseas , production and employment have actually increased .
" the products we make are quite large and it would not be feasible to ship them back home , but we have been buying components such as gearboxes here for some time , " he said .
the growing economic muscle of china has created business opportunities that could not have been envisaged a few years ago " it helps to keep our cost base in line with our competitors .
in the past , we have bought through agents ; now we want to find a partner to supply us directly . "
some firms have jumped into the china market with both feet .
deltaprint employs 140 in a packaging business in west belfast , but has a workforce of more than 500 in a joint-venture factory outside beijing .
for joint managing director colm bradley it was a good strategic move .
" we have been here five years now ; we feel we got in at the right time , " he said .
" i think we will have turnover of around £ 15m in china this year , but you have to exercise control .
you have to come out here , and you have to know what is going on .
but the era of thinking ' will i get my money out ? ' has gone . "
the growing economic muscle of china has created business opportunities that could not have been envisaged a few years ago .
china 's growing middles-class has money , wants to travel , and is now allowed to .
china 's growing middles-class has money and wants to travel tourism ireland , the promotional body for the whole of the island , recently began to dip its toe into the chinese market , by appointing a full-time representative and making a presentation to the travel trade in shanghai .
the development of china is not without its problems ; the growing gaps in wealth have created social tensions ; there remains real concerns about human rights ; the pollution that clogs shanghai 's skyline is a reminder of an environmental hangover that may have to be faced for decades to come .
however , china is on its way to becoming an economic superpower ; even thousands of miles away , little northern ireland needs to take note .

the mayor was caught on tape comparing the reporter to a " concentration camp guard " , outside a party in february .
the disciplinary panel , sitting for a second day , could , at worst , ban him from office if he is found guilty .
on tuesday , his lawyers failed to have the case thrown out - but did get one of two charges against him dropped .
the charge that the mayor failed to treat others with respect was dismissed , because it only applies to those acting in an official capacity . "
we 're still in a position where tomorrow i could be suspended from office or barred for five years " ken livingstone the three-man panel ruled mr livingstone had been acting as a private individual during the conversation with evening standard reporter oliver finegold after an official reception at city hall in february .
the case was brought against him by the standards board of england to decide if he had breached his office 's code of conduct .
if so , he could be ordered to apologise , banned from office , suspended , censured or told to go for training .
speaking on tuesday , mr livingstone said : " we 're still in a position where tomorrow i could be suspended from office or barred for five years .

the bid from baugur , which owns fashion chains oasis and coast and jeweller goldsmiths , values whittard at £ 21.5m.
whittard shares have been suffering as its sales have declined , and takeover speculation has swirled around the company since the summer .
baugur plans to merge whittard with health store operator julian graves and delist the firm from the stock market .
the offer of 90 pence per whittard share represents a premium of about 21 % to the closing price of 74.5 pence on 5 december , which was the day before whittard announced it had received a bid approach .
' strong brand ' richard rose , chairman of whittard , said that the offer comes at a time when " market sentiment towards smaller retail companies is increasingly negative and when the current retail trading environment shows no indication of short term recovery " .
baugur will buy whittard via its majority-owned barney holdings business .
julian graves founder nick shutts also is a shareholder in barney .
" whittard is a very strong brand , but we believe that its full potential can only be achieved as a private company , " said mr shutts , who also is managing director of julian graves .
" there is strong commercial logic in combining whittard with julian graves , " he said .

universal pictures said 3,568 cinemas would be screening the film .
shrek 2 holds the record for a movie launch , opening in 4,163 cinemas last year .
more than 6,000 cinemas in 55 other countries will also show the film , with its uk launch taking place on thursday .
universal hopes its initial takings will rival the $ 66m receipts for jackson 's first lord of the rings film .
the final two rings films took more than $ 100m in their first five days , as did spider-man .
brandon gray , president of cinema website boxofficemojo.com , said many variables would have an impact on kong 's takings .
' highest-grossing ' its three-hour running time restricts the number of times it can be screened in one day , while in the us , it is rated pg-13 - which cautions parents that some material may be unsuitable for children .
in the uk , it has been given a 12a rating , which means under-12s must be accompanied by adults .
" the question is not , ' will it be big ? '
the question is , ' how big will it be ? ' , " he said .
" it is poised to be the highest-grossing movie of december . "
with the film costing $ 200m to make , universal needs it to make a profit .
while several other films have had wider launches , the studio is pleased with the interest from cinema owners .
universal film distribution president nikki rocco said : " they want it , and they want it in as many dates as they can get it . "

together with british recording producer richard carrington , motion instigated the project , which aims to ensure that every significant anglophone poet from anywhere in the world is captured reading their verse .

the site launched earlier this month .
" it 's really a colossal pr job for poetry , " motion told bbc world service 's the word programme .

" it makes the fundamental point about the value of the archive very clearly , " he said .
" the beowulf poet knew the meaning of a poem .
he would have understand that it has as much to do with the sound that the poem makes as it has to do with the page sense that a poem has .
" but during the last 1,000 years the page sense has tended to dominate , for all sorts of obvious reasons .
" the poetry archive is in the very pleasant and somewhat paradoxical position to be able to say that the invention of this new thing , the internet , has allowed a very ancient truth about poetry to become manifest - which is that sound sense and page sense do have an equal value . "
' kind of emphasis ' motion did , however , stress that a poet does not know everything about their own work , and it is important to bear this in mind when listening to them read .
recordings have made larkin 's meanings clearer but he also argued it is also true that a poet has a right to the work no-one else does .
" as we 're listening to it , we understand things about the poem through the various pauses , pacings , inflexions , emphases and so on that the poet brings us during their reading , " he said .
" it may even be that little local difficulties are cleared up by the kind of emphasis that they put . "
one example has been philip larkin 's lines on a young lady 's photograph album , a passage of which reads " but o , photography ! as no art is / faithful and disappointing ! "
" i can remember looking at that and thinking , well , larkin is not a difficult poet , but what does that mean ?
i could n't understand it , " motion said .
" and you hear him reading it on the recordings that he made during his life , and he says it in his eeyore-ish voice , you realise he did n't think photography is an art , and once you 've grasped that then you understand the passage .
" there are passages in all sort of poems where that becomes important . "

together with british recording producer richard carrington , motion instigated the project , which aims to ensure that every significant anglophone poet from anywhere in the world is captured reading their verse .
that recording is then put on the internet .
the site launched earlier this month .
" it 's really a colossal pr job for poetry , " motion told bbc world service 's the word programme .
" i imagine we will end up with hundreds of poems on it . "
sense of a poem the archive has recordings from the 19th century onwards , when recordings of poets reading their work were first created .
although there are significant gaps - recordings of ae housman , thomas hardy and dh lawrence , for example , do not exist - motion explained how the he felt the value of the site is highlighted in one of the older recordings , made in the 1932 , of wb yeats , which he described as " mesmeric " .
" it makes the fundamental point about the value of the archive very clearly , " he said .
" the beowulf poet knew the meaning of a poem .
he would have understand that it has as much to do with the sound that the poem makes as it has to do with the page sense that a poem has .
" but during the last 1,000 years the page sense has tended to dominate , for all sorts of obvious reasons .
" the poetry archive is in the very pleasant and somewhat paradoxical position to be able to say that the invention of this new thing , the internet , has allowed a very ancient truth about poetry to become manifest - which is that sound sense and page sense do have an equal value . "
' kind of emphasis ' motion did , however , stress that a poet does not know everything about their own work , and it is important to bear this in mind when listening to them read .
but he also argued it is also true that a poet has a right to the work no-one else does .
" as we 're listening to it , we understand things about the poem through the various pauses , pacings , inflexions , emphases and so on that the poet brings us during their reading , " he said .
" it may even be that little local difficulties are cleared up by the kind of emphasis that they put . "

passengers aboard the seabourn spirit , a luxury liner sailing off the coast of somalia , came face to face last month with the growing problem of piracy , especially planned assaults and ocean hijackings using fast boats and sophisticated weapons .
as the pirates go hi-tech , so ships must use more advanced technology in their defence , according to the latest report from the international maritime bureau .
anti-piracy technologies endorsed by the bureau include an unmanned spy plane , the inventus uav , for aerial surveillance of risky waters .
others include secure-ship , a 9,000 volt electric fence that when rigged around ship 's deck stops the pirates from boarding , and shiploc , a hidden tagging device for ships that allows satellites to track ships on behalf of their owners even after a hijacking .
in their defence against pirates off the coast of somalia , the seabourn spirit 's crew used an acoustic weapon that focused a deafening alarm sound on the attackers , hastening their retreat .
sea-faring bots in the future , robotics could play a role in anti-piracy defences , though the technology has yet to be endorsed by the international maritime bureau .
speaking to bbc world service 's discovery for its programme on the future of shipping safety , keith henderson of marine robotics international explained how unmanned robotic vessels could help .
marine robotics have created vessels called ghost guard which can patrol the seas along pre-programmed routes , overseen by a single , human controller on shore .
the boats can also escort other ships through dangerous waters .
video and other equipment on board these robotic ships allow their on-shore controllers to see and interact with the crew of any vessels they encounter : " they could go alongside , there 's a loudspeaker and a microphone so they could have a conversation with the vessel , " said mr henderson .
" and if they feel that there 's something suspicious then they could call up a naval patrol vessel . "
people smugglers " if the vessel gets lost or damaged or sunk , then there 's no loss of life , " he added .
" if the robotic vessel goes alongside a suspicious-looking boat , and they suddenly open fire or throw hand grenades , or fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the vessel to take it out , then yes , there 's a cost factor but nobody 's lost their lives . "
mr henderson said that the dispensability of such craft makes them particularly suitable to the changing nature of world piracy , including the area of people smuggling .
" a normal naval patrol boat , if he gives chase to a smuggler often has to stop because the smuggler will start to throw people overboard .
it 's a ploy they often use , and , of course saving lives is a priority for the navy boat .
" but with a remote piloted vessel , even if the navy has to stop , the robotic vessel can continue the chase right back to its harbour , or even follow it into a bay where it starts putting people ashore .
" and of course then the smugglers ' position can be reported back to the mother vessel . "

pirates attacked the seabourn spirit in november passengers aboard the seabourn spirit , a luxury liner sailing off the coast of somalia , came face to face last month with the growing problem of piracy , especially planned assaults and ocean hijackings using fast boats and sophisticated weapons .
as the pirates go hi-tech , so ships must use more advanced technology in their defence , according to the latest report from the international maritime bureau .
anti-piracy technologies endorsed by the bureau include an unmanned spy plane , the inventus uav , for aerial surveillance of risky waters .
others include secure-ship , a 9,000 volt electric fence that when rigged around ship 's deck stops the pirates from boarding , and shiploc , a hidden tagging device for ships that allows satellites to track ships on behalf of their owners even after a hijacking .
in their defence against pirates off the coast of somalia , the seabourn spirit 's crew used an acoustic weapon that focused a deafening alarm sound on the attackers , hastening their retreat .
sea-faring bots in the future , robotics could play a role in anti-piracy defences , though the technology has yet to be endorsed by the international maritime bureau .
pirates are coming up with more ways of seizing ships speaking to bbc world service 's discovery for its programme on the future of shipping safety , keith henderson of marine robotics international explained how unmanned robotic vessels could help .
marine robotics have created vessels called ghost guard which can patrol the seas along pre-programmed routes , overseen by a single , human controller on shore .
the boats can also escort other ships through dangerous waters .
video and other equipment on board these robotic ships allow their on-shore controllers to see and interact with the crew of any vessels they encounter : " they could go alongside , there 's a loudspeaker and a microphone so they could have a conversation with the vessel , " said mr henderson .
" and if they feel that there 's something suspicious then they could call up a naval patrol vessel . "
people smugglers " if the vessel gets lost or damaged or sunk , then there 's no loss of life , " he added .
the bot vehicles can be pre-programmed with a route " if the robotic vessel goes alongside a suspicious-looking boat , and they suddenly open fire or throw hand grenades , or fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the vessel to take it out , then yes , there 's a cost factor but nobody 's lost their lives . "
mr henderson said that the dispensability of such craft makes them particularly suitable to the changing nature of world piracy , including the area of people smuggling .
" a normal naval patrol boat , if he gives chase to a smuggler often has to stop because the smuggler will start to throw people overboard .
it 's a ploy they often use , and , of course saving lives is a priority for the navy boat .
" but with a remote piloted vessel , even if the navy has to stop , the robotic vessel can continue the chase right back to its harbour , or even follow it into a bay where it starts putting people ashore .
" and of course then the smugglers ' position can be reported back to the mother vessel . "

pirates attacked the seabourn spirit in november passengers aboard the seabourn spirit , a luxury liner sailing off the coast of somalia , came face to face last month with the growing problem of piracy , especially planned assaults and ocean hijackings using fast boats and sophisticated weapons .
as the pirates go hi-tech , so ships must use more advanced technology in their defence , according to the latest report from the international maritime bureau .
anti-piracy technologies endorsed by the bureau include an unmanned spy plane , the inventus uav , for aerial surveillance of risky waters .
others include secure-ship , a 9,000 volt electric fence that when rigged around ship 's deck stops the pirates from boarding , and shiploc , a hidden tagging device for ships that allows satellites to track ships on behalf of their owners even after a hijacking .
in their defence against pirates off the coast of somalia , the seabourn spirit 's crew used an acoustic weapon that focused a deafening alarm sound on the attackers , hastening their retreat .
sea-faring bots in the future , robotics could play a role in anti-piracy defences , though the technology has yet to be endorsed by the international maritime bureau .
pirates are coming up with more ways of seizing ships speaking to bbc world service 's discovery for its programme on the future of shipping safety , keith henderson of marine robotics international explained how unmanned robotic vessels could help .
marine robotics have created vessels called ghost guard which can patrol the seas along pre-programmed routes , overseen by a single , human controller on shore .
the boats can also escort other ships through dangerous waters .
video and other equipment on board these robotic ships allow their on-shore controllers to see and interact with the crew of any vessels they encounter : " they could go alongside , there 's a loudspeaker and a microphone so they could have a conversation with the vessel , " said mr henderson .
" and if they feel that there 's something suspicious then they could call up a naval patrol vessel . "
people smugglers " if the vessel gets lost or damaged or sunk , then there 's no loss of life , " he added .
the bot vehicles can be pre-programmed with a route " if the robotic vessel goes alongside a suspicious-looking boat , and they suddenly open fire or throw hand grenades , or fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the vessel to take it out , then yes , there 's a cost factor but nobody 's lost their lives . "
mr henderson said that the dispensability of such craft makes them particularly suitable to the changing nature of world piracy , including the area of people smuggling .
" a normal naval patrol boat , if he gives chase to a smuggler often has to stop because the smuggler will start to throw people overboard .
it 's a ploy they often use , and , of course saving lives is a priority for the navy boat .
" but with a remote piloted vessel , even if the navy has to stop , the robotic vessel can continue the chase right back to its harbour , or even follow it into a bay where it starts putting people ashore .
" and of course then the smugglers ' position can be reported back to the mother vessel . "
