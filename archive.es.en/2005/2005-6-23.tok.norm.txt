as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .

the money is to go towards the establishment of 30 new research centers at universities , 40 additional graduate colleges , and extra financial support for 10 universities that are competing to be upgraded into so-called " elite universities " in the same vein as the american " ivy league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .
how would his departure affect british-eu relations ?

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back .

" he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "

a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .
earlier this year , he asked pamuk to write an article for sabah about south korea .
after it was published , he was bombarded with outraged readers ' mail , accusing him of having given a voce to a " traitor . " a relevant writer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prize jury 's decision continues a tradition of honoring writers whose works have a topical significance .
in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .
" i do n't know why they tried to give me the prize . " this time , though , pamuk will be accepting his award - at the frankfurt book fair in october . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .

to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .

" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while .

merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2005 german business looks to life after schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love-affair 's over executives , once charmed by chancellor schröder , are hungry for political and economic change with the promise of early polls .
but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .

now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum .

the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .

riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they still smiling ?
" it goes without saying that we wanted to be more successful , " said rehhagel .
" i would like to the thank the fans for getting behind us .
it is just a shame we let them down . "
rehhagel became the most popular man in greece when he guided the country to euro 2004 success with a 1-0 win over portugal , but since then things have gone downhill for the man then dubbed ' king otto ' .
to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .
" we obviously have a problem in attack , " rehhagel said .
" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- bonus rows and talk of quarreling in the camp have plagued greece of late and rehhagel is feeling the heat .
the president of the greek football federation , vassilios gagatsis , offered support on wednesday by claiming they wanted rehhagel to sign a three-year contract extension , despite the poor results .
" i hope and i want him to stay with us for the next three years and that he extends his contract until 2009 , " gagatsis told sport bild magazine .

greece won 2-1 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- gagatsis said he would do everything in his power to persuade rehhagel to remain in charge of the team he transformed from no-hopers into the surprise european champions in portugal last year .
" i do n't even want to think about what we will do after he has left , " gagatsis said .
rehhagel , who turned down the german national job after euro 2004 , has refused to discuss his future until the 2006 world cup qualifying campaign is over .
if greece fail to qualify and rehhagel resigns , there are rumors that the serb coach dusan bajevic would take over .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .

now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum .

the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute .

" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons .

since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .
earlier this year , he asked pamuk to write an article for sabah about south korea .
after it was published , he was bombarded with outraged readers ' mail , accusing him of having given a voce to a " traitor . " a relevant writer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prize jury 's decision continues a tradition of honoring writers whose works have a topical significance .
in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .
" i do n't know why they tried to give me the prize . " this time , though , pamuk will be accepting his award - at the frankfurt book fair in october . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.06.2005 turkish writer picks up german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literary ambassador for turkey turkey 's best-selling novelist orhan pamuk has been awarded the german book trade 's peace prize , reflecting a growing awareness that many of the issues preoccupying turkey these days have a profound global resonance . just one week after demonstrations took place in berlin against the german parliament 's resolution in memory of the massacre of armenians by turks in 1915 , germany has awarded one of its most prestigious cultural prizes to turkish writer orhan pamuk , an outspoken critic of his country 's inability to own up to its often harrowing history . born in 1952 , pamuk grew up among turkey 's secular upper classes .
after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .
earlier this year , he asked pamuk to write an article for sabah about south korea .
after it was published , he was bombarded with outraged readers ' mail , accusing him of having given a voce to a " traitor . " a relevant writer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prize jury 's decision continues a tradition of honoring writers whose works have a topical significance .
in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .
" i do n't know why they tried to give me the prize . " this time , though , pamuk will be accepting his award - at the frankfurt book fair in october . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .

" it goes without saying that we wanted to be more successful , " said rehhagel .

it is just a shame we let them down . "
rehhagel became the most popular man in greece when he guided the country to euro 2004 success with a 1-0 win over portugal , but since then things have gone downhill for the man then dubbed ' king otto ' .
to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .
" we obviously have a problem in attack , " rehhagel said .
" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

rehhagel , who turned down the german national job after euro 2004 , has refused to discuss his future until the 2006 world cup qualifying campaign is over .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .

" he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .

a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .

" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .

in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "

even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .

" we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .

it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .

member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .

" he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .

a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .
earlier this year , he asked pamuk to write an article for sabah about south korea .
after it was published , he was bombarded with outraged readers ' mail , accusing him of having given a voce to a " traitor . " a relevant writer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prize jury 's decision continues a tradition of honoring writers whose works have a topical significance .
in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing . " modern-day mad king ludwigs anyone with a taste for unusual real estate and ideas above their station might be tempted by the state statistics office , a former jesuit monastery in a munich pedestrian zone .
the civil servants who have been pen-pushing there for the last few decades are set to move out , and no one is waiting to replace them .
given that it 's also in urgent need of renovation , the state certainly does n't want it , and since it 's already had an offer that 's in the three-figure millions , no one is dragging their feet over the deal . another potential bijou residence for buyers with more money than sense - a little like the legendary mad king of ludwig of bavaria who built many of the state 's flashier palaces - is a historic castle near würzburg , a snip for a few million that comes complete with outhouses , a moat and several hectares of land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe the demure , classicist spa down the road in bad brückenau is more to your liking - or perhaps you 'd prefer the traditional teutonic charms of a hotel on lake chiem . peddling bavaria 's best wares ? but before you start mortgaging your children to pay for your dream home , bear in mind you may run into a spot of bother with historical preservationists , who have complained that historically valuable buildings are simply being flogged off . faltlhauser is n't having any of it .
all the owners will have to stick to certain rules , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and before walt disney starts turning in his grave , the minister has promised that the state 's real pieces de resistances certainly wo n't be changing hands in the foreseeable future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2005 german business looks to life after schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love-affair 's over executives , once charmed by chancellor schröder , are hungry for political and economic change with the promise of early polls .
but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .

the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2005 german business looks to life after schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love-affair 's over executives , once charmed by chancellor schröder , are hungry for political and economic change with the promise of early polls .
but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same .

the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons .

still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing . " modern-day mad king ludwigs anyone with a taste for unusual real estate and ideas above their station might be tempted by the state statistics office , a former jesuit monastery in a munich pedestrian zone .
the civil servants who have been pen-pushing there for the last few decades are set to move out , and no one is waiting to replace them .
given that it 's also in urgent need of renovation , the state certainly does n't want it , and since it 's already had an offer that 's in the three-figure millions , no one is dragging their feet over the deal . another potential bijou residence for buyers with more money than sense - a little like the legendary mad king of ludwig of bavaria who built many of the state 's flashier palaces - is a historic castle near würzburg , a snip for a few million that comes complete with outhouses , a moat and several hectares of land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe the demure , classicist spa down the road in bad brückenau is more to your liking - or perhaps you 'd prefer the traditional teutonic charms of a hotel on lake chiem . peddling bavaria 's best wares ? but before you start mortgaging your children to pay for your dream home , bear in mind you may run into a spot of bother with historical preservationists , who have complained that historically valuable buildings are simply being flogged off . faltlhauser is n't having any of it .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .

" it goes without saying that we wanted to be more successful , " said rehhagel .

it is just a shame we let them down . "
rehhagel became the most popular man in greece when he guided the country to euro 2004 success with a 1-0 win over portugal , but since then things have gone downhill for the man then dubbed ' king otto ' .
to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .
" we obviously have a problem in attack , " rehhagel said .
" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

the president of the greek football federation , vassilios gagatsis , offered support on wednesday by claiming they wanted rehhagel to sign a three-year contract extension , despite the poor results .
" i hope and i want him to stay with us for the next three years and that he extends his contract until 2009 , " gagatsis told sport bild magazine .

" i do n't even want to think about what we will do after he has left , " gagatsis said .
rehhagel , who turned down the german national job after euro 2004 , has refused to discuss his future until the 2006 world cup qualifying campaign is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .
brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals .
-lrb- june 22 , 2005 -rrb- germany draws with argentina germany tied 2-2 with argentina on tuesday night , making the hosts the winner of confed cup group a. the result puts both teams through to the next round .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- pleasant player surprises so far each team in the confederations cup has only played twice , but experts and fans are already talking about which players have shined in the tournament .
now that push is coming to shove , the players will have to step up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing . " modern-day mad king ludwigs anyone with a taste for unusual real estate and ideas above their station might be tempted by the state statistics office , a former jesuit monastery in a munich pedestrian zone .
the civil servants who have been pen-pushing there for the last few decades are set to move out , and no one is waiting to replace them .
given that it 's also in urgent need of renovation , the state certainly does n't want it , and since it 's already had an offer that 's in the three-figure millions , no one is dragging their feet over the deal . another potential bijou residence for buyers with more money than sense - a little like the legendary mad king of ludwig of bavaria who built many of the state 's flashier palaces - is a historic castle near würzburg , a snip for a few million that comes complete with outhouses , a moat and several hectares of land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe the demure , classicist spa down the road in bad brückenau is more to your liking - or perhaps you 'd prefer the traditional teutonic charms of a hotel on lake chiem . peddling bavaria 's best wares ? but before you start mortgaging your children to pay for your dream home , bear in mind you may run into a spot of bother with historical preservationists , who have complained that historically valuable buildings are simply being flogged off . faltlhauser is n't having any of it .
all the owners will have to stick to certain rules , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and before walt disney starts turning in his grave , the minister has promised that the state 's real pieces de resistances certainly wo n't be changing hands in the foreseeable future .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while .

the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed .

" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing . " modern-day mad king ludwigs anyone with a taste for unusual real estate and ideas above their station might be tempted by the state statistics office , a former jesuit monastery in a munich pedestrian zone .
the civil servants who have been pen-pushing there for the last few decades are set to move out , and no one is waiting to replace them .
given that it 's also in urgent need of renovation , the state certainly does n't want it , and since it 's already had an offer that 's in the three-figure millions , no one is dragging their feet over the deal . another potential bijou residence for buyers with more money than sense - a little like the legendary mad king of ludwig of bavaria who built many of the state 's flashier palaces - is a historic castle near würzburg , a snip for a few million that comes complete with outhouses , a moat and several hectares of land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe the demure , classicist spa down the road in bad brückenau is more to your liking - or perhaps you 'd prefer the traditional teutonic charms of a hotel on lake chiem . peddling bavaria 's best wares ? but before you start mortgaging your children to pay for your dream home , bear in mind you may run into a spot of bother with historical preservationists , who have complained that historically valuable buildings are simply being flogged off . faltlhauser is n't having any of it .
all the owners will have to stick to certain rules , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and before walt disney starts turning in his grave , the minister has promised that the state 's real pieces de resistances certainly wo n't be changing hands in the foreseeable future .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

bavaria , home to many of the fairytale palaces that inspired walt disney , is currently selling off prime property it ca n't afford to maintain . as you sift through the property pages of your local newspaper , you might find a bargain tucked away between the overpriced one-room apartments .
the state of bavaria is currently advertising some 170 prime properties it feels it no longer needs - so if you happen to have a fortune at your fingertips , a hilltop mansion with dreaming spires and acres of land could now be yours . but be warned - bartering 's out of the question .
" this is n't about earning some quick cash , " stressed kurt faltlhauser , bavarian interior minister . " we 're not just hawking any old thing . " modern-day mad king ludwigs anyone with a taste for unusual real estate and ideas above their station might be tempted by the state statistics office , a former jesuit monastery in a munich pedestrian zone .
the civil servants who have been pen-pushing there for the last few decades are set to move out , and no one is waiting to replace them .
given that it 's also in urgent need of renovation , the state certainly does n't want it , and since it 's already had an offer that 's in the three-figure millions , no one is dragging their feet over the deal . another potential bijou residence for buyers with more money than sense - a little like the legendary mad king of ludwig of bavaria who built many of the state 's flashier palaces - is a historic castle near würzburg , a snip for a few million that comes complete with outhouses , a moat and several hectares of land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe the demure , classicist spa down the road in bad brückenau is more to your liking - or perhaps you 'd prefer the traditional teutonic charms of a hotel on lake chiem . peddling bavaria 's best wares ? but before you start mortgaging your children to pay for your dream home , bear in mind you may run into a spot of bother with historical preservationists , who have complained that historically valuable buildings are simply being flogged off . faltlhauser is n't having any of it .
all the owners will have to stick to certain rules , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and before walt disney starts turning in his grave , the minister has promised that the state 's real pieces de resistances certainly wo n't be changing hands in the foreseeable future .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.06.2005 turkish writer picks up german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a literary ambassador for turkey turkey 's best-selling novelist orhan pamuk has been awarded the german book trade 's peace prize , reflecting a growing awareness that many of the issues preoccupying turkey these days have a profound global resonance . just one week after demonstrations took place in berlin against the german parliament 's resolution in memory of the massacre of armenians by turks in 1915 , germany has awarded one of its most prestigious cultural prizes to turkish writer orhan pamuk , an outspoken critic of his country 's inability to own up to its often harrowing history . born in 1952 , pamuk grew up among turkey 's secular upper classes .
after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .
earlier this year , he asked pamuk to write an article for sabah about south korea .
after it was published , he was bombarded with outraged readers ' mail , accusing him of having given a voce to a " traitor . " a relevant writer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prize jury 's decision continues a tradition of honoring writers whose works have a topical significance .
in 2003 , us essayist susan sontag -lrb- photo -rrb- received the award for her reflections on the fragile state of post 9/11 trans-atlantic relations .
a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .
" i do n't know why they tried to give me the prize . " this time , though , pamuk will be accepting his award - at the frankfurt book fair in october . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking the mold turkey 's bid for eu membership might still be a touch-and-go issue , but a look at germany ’ s cultural mainstream shows that the country ’ s turkish community has never been more visible .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .

but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .
it is a foundation stone of german-style capitalism but a number of employers say it acts as a brake on the creation of new jobs . merkel envisages a more flexible system where compromise still has an important role to play , but details remain sketchy . as for the subject of lower taxes , the party is also keeping its lips sealed . " there will be room for manoeuvre only when the german economy grows more than it is doing at present , " cdu premier of the western state of hesse , roland koch , told business daily handelsblatt this month . same strategy as always ? it was not so long ago that schröder , nicknamed " the bosses ' comrade " won applause from germany 's boardrooms . but economic stagnation , dithering over the pursuit of reform and a flirt by leading social democrats with class-war rhetoric to re-galvanise its supporters have led the business community to start looking to an alternative . for analysts , though , there is reason to fear more of the same . " a new government will carry out some reforms but they will only be small measures and , at the end of the day , it will be the same strategy as the past few years , " pohl said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it .

as germany gears up for planned elections in september , parties big and small , old and new are dusting down their soap boxes and sprucing up their images in preparation for the battle ahead . one party in particular which is making the most of the reinvention opportunities somehow inherent to election time , is the successor party to the east german communists , the pds . the party of democratic socialism has announced plans to be renamed the " linkspartei " -lrb- left party -rrb- , thus clearing the way to stand in an alliance with the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , founded in january by trade unionists and politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . pds party chairman , lothar bisky announced the renaming plans on wednesday , saying that the original suggestion to rename the party as " democratic left .
pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they still smiling ?
" it goes without saying that we wanted to be more successful , " said rehhagel .
" i would like to the thank the fans for getting behind us .
it is just a shame we let them down . "
rehhagel became the most popular man in greece when he guided the country to euro 2004 success with a 1-0 win over portugal , but since then things have gone downhill for the man then dubbed ' king otto ' .
to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .
" we obviously have a problem in attack , " rehhagel said .
" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- bonus rows and talk of quarreling in the camp have plagued greece of late and rehhagel is feeling the heat .
the president of the greek football federation , vassilios gagatsis , offered support on wednesday by claiming they wanted rehhagel to sign a three-year contract extension , despite the poor results .
" i hope and i want him to stay with us for the next three years and that he extends his contract until 2009 , " gagatsis told sport bild magazine .

the other teams in group a are russia and spain .
greece won 2-1 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- gagatsis said he would do everything in his power to persuade rehhagel to remain in charge of the team he transformed from no-hopers into the surprise european champions in portugal last year .
" i do n't even want to think about what we will do after he has left , " gagatsis said .
rehhagel , who turned down the german national job after euro 2004 , has refused to discuss his future until the 2006 world cup qualifying campaign is over .
if greece fail to qualify and rehhagel resigns , there are rumors that the serb coach dusan bajevic would take over .
bajevic has won eight league titles and five cups in greece with a variety of clubs . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

" the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .

his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .

he rejected the honor .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .
the country 's islamic intellectuals accused him of exploiting religious and historical themes to pander to western tastes .
still , however progressive and pro-european he may be , his support of turkey 's westward development is far from unconditional . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admirers see his work as a rejection of a recent intellectual tradition that aspires to be western by ignoring the past .
" if you try to repress memories , something always comes back , " pamuk once said in an interview with time magazine .
" i 'm what comes back . " a love-hate relationship according to the selection board that chose pamuk , in novels such as " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , " he follows the historical traces of the west in the east and of the east in the west in a way no other writer does . " he enjoys both commercial success and critical acclaim in his home country .
his 1990 novel " kara kitap " is widely seen as one of the most controversial and popular readings in turkish literature . but despite his phenomenal popularity , turkey itself has a love-hate relationship with pamuk .
nationalist groups angry at his criticism of turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority want to see his books removed from public libraries . and while many welcome the attention he brings turkey as its literary ambassador , others envy his international stature .
" there is a lot of jealousy that orhan pamuk has been translated into so many languages , " said one anonymous source in an interview in the tagesspiegel newspaper . yavus baydar from the newspaper sabah has described the award as " very significant for freedom of speech in turkey . "
he knows what he 's talking about .

a year later , the selection of hungarian novelist peter esterhazy came shortly after the eu 's eastwards enlargement .
in 2005 , the choice of pamuk serves as a reminder of just how much turkey and turkish issues factor into germany 's political and cultural debate . " my novel -lrb- " snow " -rrb- is about the inner conflicts of modern turks , " he told die zeit in april .
" it 's about the contradictions between islam and modernism and the desire to be integrated into europe - and the simultaneous fear . " in 1998 , ankara wanted to present him with turkey 's highest cultural accolade , the title of state artist .
he rejected the honor .
" for years i have been criticizing the state for putting authors in jail , for only trying to solve the kurdish problem by force , and for its narrow-minded nationalism , " said pamuk .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .

riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .

the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .

the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

" the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

after spending several years in new york , he was given a mixed reception when he returned to istanbul , the city where he was born .

pds " had been disallowed under electoral law . party leadership urges sense although the name " die linkspartei " has yet to receive the blessing of party members at the annual conference scheduled for mid-july , bisky made it clear that blocking the change would only damage the chances of success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky " with the new name , we want to send out a signal that we 're starting something new .
the historic chance for a joint left-wing party in western and eastern germany should not collapse over an argument about a name , " bisky said . but a number of leading pds politicians beg to differ .
member of parliament petra pau told the berliner zeitung newspaper " if pds is on the inside , it should say so on the outside . " others have indicated that the party leadership will have to bang the drum hard for the new name in order to get the two-thirds majority backing they need for endorsement . what 's in a name ? it might seem like a lot of hot semantic air , but in actual fact there is more to ceremony than this renaming game .
it sends a signal to the wasg , which flatly rejects any name containing pds , that they are serious about the new alliance formed by leaders of the two parties two weeks ago . since that time , the joint force has been steadily gaining ground in the opinion polls .
a survey published by the forsa research group this week showed that in the event of an election this sunday , the alliance would scoop nine percent of the vote , third only to the cdu and csu and gerhard schröder 's social democrats . that said , most of those polled conceded that they were still trying to decide how to cast their ballot come september . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany left behind while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

but the party now looks over after a disastrous confed cup , potentially spelling trouble for german coach otto rehagel . greece drew 0-0 with mexico in their final group b match here on wednesday but finishing bottom of the group without scoring a goal was not the plan before the tournament .
a 3-0 defeat against brazil and a 1-0 loss against japan had already sealed greece 's fate and it is back to the drawing board for the side 's german leader rehhagel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they still smiling ?
" it goes without saying that we wanted to be more successful , " said rehhagel .
" i would like to the thank the fans for getting behind us .
it is just a shame we let them down . "
rehhagel became the most popular man in greece when he guided the country to euro 2004 success with a 1-0 win over portugal , but since then things have gone downhill for the man then dubbed ' king otto ' .
to reach the 2006 world cup greece face an uphill task with ukraine eight points clear in the qualifying group and only the winners assured of automatic place in the finals .
victory against kazakhstan , denmark and georgia in the final three matches could see greece sneak in via a play-off but a barren spell in front of goal does not bode well .
" we obviously have a problem in attack , " rehhagel said .
" we have not scored for five games and you can not win games without scoring . "

-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- bonus rows and talk of quarreling in the camp have plagued greece of late and rehhagel is feeling the heat .
the president of the greek football federation , vassilios gagatsis , offered support on wednesday by claiming they wanted rehhagel to sign a three-year contract extension , despite the poor results .
" i hope and i want him to stay with us for the next three years and that he extends his contract until 2009 , " gagatsis told sport bild magazine .

greece won 2-1 .
-lrb- ap photo / luca bruno -rrb- gagatsis said he would do everything in his power to persuade rehhagel to remain in charge of the team he transformed from no-hopers into the surprise european champions in portugal last year .
" i do n't even want to think about what we will do after he has left , " gagatsis said .
rehhagel , who turned down the german national job after euro 2004 , has refused to discuss his future until the 2006 world cup qualifying campaign is over .
if greece fail to qualify and rehhagel resigns , there are rumors that the serb coach dusan bajevic would take over .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum .

the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute .

" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons .

since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .

ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.06.2005 german business looks to life after schröder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love-affair 's over executives , once charmed by chancellor schröder , are hungry for political and economic change with the promise of early polls .
but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy . in a survey of 22,000 firms conducted by the german board of trade and industry , 58 percent said they thought the overall business situation would improve after the poll , which is expected to be held in september and which the conservatives look set to win . germany 's leading stock market index , the dax , has soared too at the possibility of regime change in berlin .
the index , which comprises the 30 leading stocks listed on the frankfurt stock exchange , has jumped five percent since schröder , a social democrat , said last month he would seek early general elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank most of the big banks expect the trend to continue .
the sunnier outlook is based " on the hope that a new government will chart a clear course for reform , " rolf schneider , chief economist at the dresdner bank , said .
with five million unemployed , tepid economic growth and sickly public finances , germany 's erstwhile reputation as europe 's economic powerhouse seems a distant dream . conservatives vacillate on toughness of reform but , if business executives were hoping for strong words and a clearer sense of direction from the more business-friendly conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- with tough-talking angela merkel , as their joint candidate for chancellor , they may have to wait a while . " the cdu / csu are just full of contradictions at the moment , " said rüdiger pohl , an economist at halle university . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel indeed , the cdu / csu have made few concrete economic proposals for fear of alienating voters while they are riding high in the opinion polls .
merkel has even overtaken chancellor schröder in popularity ratings . .
the cdu looks set to pursue and probably even sharpen the unpopular reforms of the welfare state - a legacy of postwar reconstruction and the economic miracle - begun by the present government if it wins . it plans to unveil its election platform next month and many political observers expect it to remain vague as long as possible , although some initial proposals have surfaced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration in germany against cuts in social reforms and loosening of labor laws these include making the labour market more " flexible " - shorthand for loosening germany 's iron-clad protections for employees , lowering taxes , shoring up the health system to stabilise contributions , and driving down employers ' costs . to compensate and fill the tills , tough measures are envisaged with the plugging of tax loopholes and a rise in the basic rate of value added tax from 16 to 18 per cent .
this remains controversial given its feared impact on already anaemic domestic consumption but is widely backed by all the major parties . the cdu / csu bloc has been spurred on by the liberal free democrats , their probable coalition partners , who are demanding political reforms including lifting limits on corporate layoffs . merkel 's party prefers to proceed more cautiously - at least in its rhetoric - to avoid scaring the electorate .
she is of two minds about completely overhauling the system of co-determination , the process whereby decisions are made jointly by management and workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.06.2005 blair urges eu to accept change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is n't the most popular man in europe right now ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area . " the issue is not between a free market europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project , " he said . stressing that that those calling for the eu to change should not be accused of betraying european ideals , british prime minister blair called on europe to push through economic and budgetary reform or lag behind in the global economy . " we need reform urgently in europe , if europe is to grow , " he said . after the summit of eu leaders in brussels last week foundered on blair 's refusal to give up britain 's treasured budget rebate except as part of a wider inquisition into spending , few expected his words to fall on sympathetic ears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent days , blair has been castigated by other leaders - notably french president jacques chirac , german chancellor gerhard schröder and eu commission president jose manuel barroso - for being only interested in europe 's trading dimensions , and willing to sacrifice the good of the eu for petty national interests . little more than a free trade zone his vision for the eu is certainly not the same as chirac 's or gerhard schröder 's .
schröder told the mass circulation bild thursday that he was firmly against the bloc becoming little more than a free trade zone . " that 's not what i want , " he said .
" -lrb- the bloc -rrb- is a successful social model based on common values , rights and obligations .
anyone who wants to undermine this model - be it out of national interests or populism - is offending against the rights of future generations . " blair retaliated in his speech by emphasizing that " this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognize that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support among the people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a guest commentary in bild , blair rejected accusations that his sole priority was making the eu a large market . " britain supports a social europe , " he said .
" but it must be a social europe that suits the world today . "
in an interview with the daily tagesspiegel , he described himself as a " passionate european " and pointed out that the uk had signed up to the eu 's social charter during his premiership . blair takes the blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is a somewhat bitter irony probably not lost on blair that while in britain he is often reviled as an arch-europhile , elsewhere in the eu he is being blamed for plunging the bloc into crisis . at home , when the subject of europe comes up , the prime minister is usually portrayed as a vanguard federalist seeking to sell out britain 's national interests to brussels .
even on a more balanced view , blair is markedly pro-european by the standards of his country . he came to power in 1997 publicly determined to integrate london closer with the european mainstream , notably in pushing for britain to join the euro at some point . pro-europe after all ? this made him considerably more pro-europe than many in his left-leaning labour party , not to mention the main opposition conservatives , who generally take a far more hostile stance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : repeated opinion polls have also showed a significant majority of britons wanting to keep the pound , meaning even blair would have been unlikely to have won the issue had he put it to a referendum .
as it turned out this was never necessary .
in june 2003 , blair 's finance minister , gordon brown , announced that five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of joining the eurozone had not been passed , putting off any decision . blair was also notably more enthusiastic about the now-scuppered eu constitution , originally insisting it should be approved by britain without a referendum , only backing down after it become clear public opinion was against him . reshaping in his own image yet blair 's positive feelings for the eu stem as much from a desire to re-shape the bloc to his own image as fondness for the existing status quo . on a number of occasions - notably the iraq war - blair has pointedly backed the " new europe " of economically vibrant eastern european states over the traditional powerhouses of france and germany . fears among fellow eu members that blair wanted to drastically scale back the eu were a complete misreading of his beliefs , according to denis macshane , until last month blair 's minister for europe . " he supports european foreign policy , " he told reporters earlier this week .
" he supports social dimensions , he supports -lrb- common -rrb- defense .
the idea that britain under tony blair is going to go to a reversion of a europe of nation states without a strong european union is simply not the case . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have two sides in blair , " said alasdair murray from london-based think tank , the centre for european reform .
" on one side he is very pragmatic ... another side of him is much more messianic - he has a vision , he uses language that has almost a sort of religious imagery in it . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .
-lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- " europe is in a profound crisis " the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . ´ -lrb- june 21 , 2005 -rrb- britain , blair , brown and europe tony blair managed to lead his new labour back to the helm of britain , but analysts predict he wo n't serve a full third term .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

he has been at the origin of most attacks , feeding the livewire forward luciano figueroa , and his free kicks have wreaked havoc in opposing defenses .
bildunterschrift : argentina 's luciano figueroa , center , is congratulated by teammates juan riquelme , left , and juan sorin after scoring the opening goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between australia and argentina in nuremberg , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / thomas kienzle -rrb- the man who turns 27 on friday - bizarrely , the same birthday and same age as nakamura - believes he is playing the best football of his life .
" i think i am at the height of my career , " said the villarreal player .
riquelme has made nonsense of the assessment of former argentina coach marcelo bielsa who said he was " too slow " to star at international level .
he is just grateful to have been given a new start under coach jose pekerman .
" it is just a joy to play in this team and we believe we are heading in the right direction , " riquelme said after the 2-2 draw with germany in the argentines ' final group game .
if there is one player mexico must be wary of in sunday 's semi-final in hanover it is riquelme .
like bielsa , barcelona also considered riquelme surplus to requirements and he turned his loan move from the catalans to villarreal into a permanent deal this week .
having helped villarreal to a surprising third in the spanish league last season with 15 goals , riquelme can look forward to the champions league in 2005-2006 .
japan 's hero nakamura came to germany looking for a switch from italian serie a side reggina , and he has surely caused agents ' phone around the world to ring with his performances in japan 's campaign here .
bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equaliser .
the match ended in a 2-2 draw .
-lrb- ap photo / armando franca -rrb- in combination with super-sub masashi oguro , nakamura helped japan to defy expectations and they only narrowly lost out to brazil for qualification by virtue of goal difference .
nakamura 's free kick allowed oguro to pull japan level against the brazilians , who will now be wary of meeting them next year .
twice elected man of the match - he got the accolade in the 1-0 win over greece as well - nakamura has outshone japan 's best-known player , hidetoshi nakata , and will be a strong contender to be named in the best eleven players of this eight-nation tournament .

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- despite some rocky first-round performances , some brazilians are sure to also be nominated to that exclusive group .
everyone already knew about world footballer of the year ronaldinho , but european audiences will have been impressed by their first view of his young protege robinho .
although both players faded as brazil lost to mexico , they were sparkling in the first half against japan and scored a goal apiece .
unlike the robust riquelme and nakamura though , 23-year-old robinho looks physically a little slight for the world cup . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil squeaks past japan japan nearly pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament by drawing 2-2 with brazil in cologne on wednesday night .

" ethical funds " make it possible , as more germans are finding out . greedy foreign investors and companies that would do anything to make a profit - those are the " locusts " social democratic leader franz müntefering was talking about when he recently lambasted the state of german capitalism . were müntefering to dig a little deeper though , he 'd find that there is a good side to capitalism embraced by ethical investors who care about sustainability and social responsibility .
call them the ants . ethical funds , also known as socially responsible or " green " funds , offer investors with a conscience the ability to rest easy , safe in the knowledge that their money is not supporting companies involved in such areas as animal testing , nuclear energy , pornography , weapons , gambling and tobacco . " there are different concepts on what constitutes an ethical company , " said paschen von flotow , managing director of the sustainable business institute at the european business school .
" one is positive screening , where fund managers try to find the companies within one sector that are ' better ' than others , and the other way is to do negative screening , whereby you eliminate companies you do n't want for various environmental or ethical reasons . " although ethical funds remain a niche product , they represent an investment sector that is booming in europe , and especially in the german-speaking world , where there are currently around 120 different funds available . " the number of ethical funds is increasing today compared to the conventional market , where we see a decrease in the number of funds , " said von flotow . awareness lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical funds exclude companies that benefit from child labor .
since 1998 , demand for ethical funds has caused the total investment volume to balloon from around 300 million euros to a current volume of over 6.5 billion euros .
still , despite their success , ethical funds make up just 0.5 percent of the total market in investment funds .
while optimists might say this leaves plenty of room for growth , it 's also an indication of a lack of awareness both among the public , as well as professionals working in the financial sector . " the problem is that the financial advisors of banks whose job it is to sell funds often don ’ t have much time to spend with clients , so they typically focus on those funds which they think are easy to explain , " von flotow said .
" sometimes the advisors don ’ t even know whether their bank even offers ethical funds . " another problem has strictly to do with image .
ethical funds are often considered to be less profitable than conventional funds , even among people who are interested in making socially and environmentally responsible decisions .
in reality , ethical funds have been performing solidly on the german market . someone who invested 10,000 euros in leading ethical fund " ökovision " in 2003 , for example , would now be able to cash in their shares for roughly 12,800 euros .
the same amount invested in a comparable conventional fund with leading german mutual fund manager dws would have yielded 12,050 euros over the same period . in addition to pure mutual funds , there are also ethical pension funds that invest in state securities .
omitted from these portfolios are governments that own atomic weapons , use the death penalty , or have refused to sign the kyoto treaty on climate change - meaning the united states , japan , britain and france all fail to make the grade . increased transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is acting to encourage more transparency for investors a common factor with all ethical investments is an increased level of transparency for the investor . in the past , germans investing in pension funds , for example , were in the dark about what the funds ' yields were supporting .
now , thanks to new legislation approved by the german parliament earlier this month , pension funds are obliged to report yearly on if and how they act ecologically and ethically with the funds at their disposal .
" a milestone , " according to walter kahlenborn , managing director of the german sustainable investment forum . " the new rules on transparency will have the effect of stimulating the market and promoting the social , ethical and ecological aspects of investment management , " kahlenborn said . similarly , companies wishing to be included in an ethical mutual fund also have comply with more rigorous corporate social responsibility -lrb- csr -rrb- reporting standards , answering questions about their social and environmental standards , both at home and in developing countries .
the questions also go beyond product-related issues to include management issues such as company policy on diversity and equal opportunity . an increase in consumers seeking to make informed investment choices could even rescue capitalism 's blemished reputation in germany , said paschen von flotow of the sustainable business institute . " since we 've had this debate about capitalism in germany , there 's been more discussion about responsible investment , and certainly for me , sustainable investment could be an important element of the further development of capitalism , " von flotow said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

until now , both were level pegging - 40 % of cases linked to men , 40 % to women and 20 % to joint problems .
however , the european society for human reproduction and embryology found rates of an ivf treatment typically used to help male infertility have risen .
it said a number of factors including declining sperm quality due to environmental toxins may be involved .
a male problem use of icsi -lrb- intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection -rrb- , in which a single sperm is injected into the egg to fertilise it , made up only 43 % of ivf cycles in 1997 , but accounted for 52 % of cycles in 2002 .
having a family when you are younger is always a good plan dr allan pacey , british fertility society there were more than 122,000 icsi cycles and nearly 113,000 ivf cycles in 2002 , the eshre committee announced at its annual meeting in copenhagen on wednesday .
the data came from 24 european countries .
dr anders nyboe anderson , coordinator of the committee , said : " we do not really know why icsi has become more prevalent .
there are probably many reasons . "
it could be that the causes of infertility are shifting .
he added : " we see less and less infertility caused by severe tubal -lsb- fertility tube -rsb- problems in women , probably because of better sexual protection due to the risk of aids during the last 15 years . "
however he said the data on male subfertility showed it appeared to be increasing .
age-related problems dr anderson said : " maybe environmental factors are playing an increasing role as the planet becomes more polluted and factors that disrupt the endocrine system are in the food chain . "
but he said it was more likely that icsi was becoming the preferred method of assisted reproduction , as the technique has improved since its introduction in the early 1990s .
he said private clinics tended to use icsi rather than ivf to improve the chance of success first time , even though both techniques have the same take-home-baby rate .
another theory is that men , like women , are increasingly putting off starting a family until they are older , when fertility is lower , dr anderson said .
more and more men aged 50-65 are now attending fertility clinics - men over 40 making up nearly a quarter of consultations , the study said .
impact in separate research , a team of canadian scientists have found damage to dna in sperm increases with age .
by analysing the sperm of 2,134 men they found a wide variation in quality that was linked with age .
dna damage was far higher in men over 45 than in younger men - men aged 45 had double the damage of those younger than 30 .
he said data from the us showed that the birth rate for fathers older than 35 had increased by nearly 20 % between 1980 and 1995 .
lead author dr sergey moskotsev , of the mount sinai hospital in toronto , told the eshre conference : " the effect of age on male infertility is particularly interesting because of the growth in the number of men choosing to father children at older ages .
" the combination of increased female factor infertility , increased sperm dna damage , low levels of dna repair and increased abnormalities in conventional semen parameters will have a pronounced impact on their reproductive potential . "
dr allan pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the university of sheffield and secretary of the british fertility society , said : " this should remind us that the male reproductive system is not immune from the effects of ageing .
" whilst the effects of aging are not as dramatic as are seen in women , subtle changes in dna quality could seriously affect a couple 's ability to conceive , or could lead to miscarriage or even health problems in any children born .
" having a family when you are younger is always a good plan . "

until now , both were level pegging - 40 % of cases linked to men , 40 % to women and 20 % to joint problems .
however , the european society for human reproduction and embryology found rates of an ivf treatment typically used to help male infertility have risen .
it said a number of factors including declining sperm quality due to environmental toxins may be involved .
a male problem use of icsi -lrb- intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection -rrb- , in which a single sperm is injected into the egg to fertilise it , made up only 43 % of ivf cycles in 1997 , but accounted for 52 % of cycles in 2002 .
having a family when you are younger is always a good plan dr allan pacey , british fertility society there were more than 122,000 icsi cycles and nearly 113,000 ivf cycles in 2002 , the eshre committee announced at its annual meeting in copenhagen on wednesday .
the data came from 24 european countries .
dr anders nyboe anderson , coordinator of the committee , said : " we do not really know why icsi has become more prevalent .
there are probably many reasons . "
it could be that the causes of infertility are shifting .
he added : " we see less and less infertility caused by severe tubal -lsb- fertility tube -rsb- problems in women , probably because of better sexual protection due to the risk of aids during the last 15 years . "
however he said the data on male subfertility showed it appeared to be increasing .
age-related problems dr anderson said : " maybe environmental factors are playing an increasing role as the planet becomes more polluted and factors that disrupt the endocrine system are in the food chain . "
but he said it was more likely that icsi was becoming the preferred method of assisted reproduction , as the technique has improved since its introduction in the early 1990s .
he said private clinics tended to use icsi rather than ivf to improve the chance of success first time , even though both techniques have the same take-home-baby rate .
another theory is that men , like women , are increasingly putting off starting a family until they are older , when fertility is lower , dr anderson said .
more and more men aged 50-65 are now attending fertility clinics - men over 40 making up nearly a quarter of consultations , the study said .
impact in separate research , a team of canadian scientists have found damage to dna in sperm increases with age .
by analysing the sperm of 2,134 men they found a wide variation in quality that was linked with age .
dna damage was far higher in men over 45 than in younger men - men aged 45 had double the damage of those younger than 30 .
he said data from the us showed that the birth rate for fathers older than 35 had increased by nearly 20 % between 1980 and 1995 .
lead author dr sergey moskotsev , of the mount sinai hospital in toronto , told the eshre conference : " the effect of age on male infertility is particularly interesting because of the growth in the number of men choosing to father children at older ages .
" the combination of increased female factor infertility , increased sperm dna damage , low levels of dna repair and increased abnormalities in conventional semen parameters will have a pronounced impact on their reproductive potential . "
dr allan pacey , senior lecturer in andrology at the university of sheffield and secretary of the british fertility society , said : " this should remind us that the male reproductive system is not immune from the effects of ageing .
" whilst the effects of aging are not as dramatic as are seen in women , subtle changes in dna quality could seriously affect a couple 's ability to conceive , or could lead to miscarriage or even health problems in any children born .

the action group also claims that farmers and suppliers in the developing world are not getting a fair deal because of the purchasing power of tesco , asda , sainsbury 's and morrisons .
friends of the earth says more regulation is needed to stop the suffering of uk farmers and smaller high street retailers .
" mps must act now to curb the growing market power of supermarkets and ensure that britain 's booming supermarket industry does not kill off farmers , consumer choice and the traditional british high street , " said friends of the earth 's supermarket campaigner vicki hird .

a team from adelaide found baby girls born to obese mothers were more likely to have irregular periods as women .
as obesity soars in the western world , this could lead to increasing levels of fertility problems , they warned .
the findings were presented to the european society for human reproduction and embryology conference in denmark .
epidemic lead researcher dr michael davies from the research centre in reproductive health at the university of adelaide , said : " we may reasonably expect an epidemic of menstrual and fertility diseases as a consequence . "
pcos symptoms sufferers may have some or all of the following amenorrhea -lrb- no menstrual period -rrb- multiple , small cysts in the ovaries obesity or weight gain acne excess hair recurrent miscarriage skin tags increased levels of male hormone insulin resistance his team interviewed 544 women who had been born between 1973 and 1974 , which meant they were now aged between 30 and 32 .
the women were asked about their medical history .
their records were also checked to assess their own birth weight and the weight of their mothers at the last clinical examination before they had given birth .
the women who reported having irregular periods were far more likely to have been large babies and their mothers were more likely to have been obese while carrying them in the womb .
these women also reported symptoms that are common with a leading cause of female infertility - a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome -lrb- pcos -rrb- .
these included symptoms such as excess facial and body hair .
however , women who had a diagnosis of full blown pcos tended to have been smaller than average babies .
dr davies said this suggests that there are two overlapping mechanisms behind the abnormalities .
" one pathway may be mediated by high maternal weight in late pregnancy , which is linked to irregular periods in the daughter , and possibly obesity and weight-related reproduction problems .
" a second pathway may involve reduced placental and foetal growth , which is linked to the more severe symptoms of pcos in the daughter , usually resulting in an early clinical diagnosis of the syndrome . "
one in seven couples currently has problems conceiving .
around a fifth of adults in britain are obese and three-quarters are overweight .

the public accounts committee criticised ministers and the nhs for a lack of urgency over ward cleanliness , hand hygiene and side room shortages .
new figures show a 6.1 % drop in overall mrsa infections , despite an increase in almost four out of 10 hospitals .
health minister jane kennedy said nhs trusts were fully engaged in combating hospital-acquired infections .
' worrying situation ' committee chairman edward leigh told radio 4 's today programme that four years after the committee asked the government to insist on mandatory reporting of all hospital-acquired infections , it was still not being done .
he said there was mandatory reporting of mrsa , but this only represented 6 % of around 300,000 infection cases a year .
the report by the cross party group of mps also called for the much-quoted figure of 5,000 deaths a year from hospital-acquired infections to be updated , as it related to the 1980s .
" we do n't know in detail how many people are actually dying - some of these figures go back to the 1980s .
it is a worrying situation , " said mr leigh . "
everybody knows full well ... hospitals are not as clean now as they were 30 or 40 years ago " edward leigh public accounts committee q & a : mrsa ' superbugs ' ' bug disabled my mother ' the bugs hitting the wards he said that despite hospitals being increasingly hi-tech , basic procedures " talked about for 100 years " were not in place .
" if we do n't know what 's going on , how can we get a grip on this problem ? " he added .
" everybody listening to this programme knows full well ... hospitals are not as clean now as they were 30 or 40 years ago . "
the committee called for a surveillance scheme for all hospital infections - only about 20 % are currently monitored .
and the mps concluded there needed to be a root and branch shift towards prevention at all levels of the nhs .
control teams ms kennedy said england had one of the most detailed surveillance systems in the world .
mrsa rates by hospital most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader she said : " every trust has infection control teams ... and have signed up to the ' clean our hands ' campaign .
" we were the first government to introduce mandatory surveillance of mrsa . "
ms kennedy added a raft of infection rates for conditions , including clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci , would be published later this year .
she also highlighted the latest mrsa infection rates for english hospitals , which showed a yearly drop for the first time since records began in 2001-2 .
the 6.1 % fall means the bloodstream infection rate is at its lowest level yet , but is still well short of meeting the target of fewer than 4,000 cases by 2007-8 .
good hygiene dr georgia duckworth , an mrsa expert at the health protection agency , said there was still a lot of work to do .
" the most important thing to remember in the control of hospital infections such as mrsa is good hospital hygiene and in particular washing hands thoroughly in between patients . "
liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb accused ministers of being obsessed with producing initiatives to " grab headlines " .
" the government 's figures do n't tell the whole story .
the government must collect and publish the facts about the true level of infection in the nhs , including mrsa and other serious infections . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said the report had proved the government had been complacent .
" pressure from the national audit office , the conservative party and the media has forced the government to announce a number of initiatives in the space of the last few months , but these respond only to a fraction of the problem and are too often delayed . "

with your permission , i will come back after each european council during the uk presidency and report to you .
in addition , i would be happy to consult the parliament before each council , so as to have the benefit of the views of the european parliament before council deliberations .
this is a timely address .
whatever else people disagree upon in europe today , they at least agree on one point : europe is in the midst of a profound debate about its future .
i want to talk to you plainly today about this debate , the reasons for it and how to resolve it .
in every crisis there is an opportunity .
there is one here for europe now , if we have the courage to take it .
the debate over europe should not be conducted by trading insults or in terms of personality .
it should be an open and frank exchange of ideas .
and right at the outset i want to describe clearly how i define the debate and the disagreement underlying it .
the issue is not between a " free market " europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project .
this is not just a misrepresentation .
it is to intimidate those who want change in europe by representing the desire for change as betrayal of the european ideal , to try to shut off serious debate about europe 's future by claiming that the very insistence on debate is to embrace the anti-europe .
it is a mindset i have fought against all my political life .
ideals survive through change .
they die through inertia in the face of challenge .
i am a passionate pro-european .
i always have been .
my first vote was in 1975 in the british referendum on membership and i voted yes .
in 1983 , when i was the last candidate in the uk to be selected shortly before that election and when my party had a policy of withdrawing from europe , i told the selection conference that i disagreed with the policy .
some thought i had lost the selection .
some perhaps wish i had .
i then helped change our policy in the 1980 's and was proud of that change .
since being prime minister i signed the social chapter , helped , along with france , to create the modern european defence policy , have played my part in the amsterdam , the nice , then the rome treaties .
this is a union of values , of solidarity between nations and people , of not just a common market in which we trade but a common political space in which we live as citizens .
it always will be .
i believe in europe as a political project .
i believe in europe with a strong and caring social dimension .
i would never accept a europe that was simply an economic market .
to say that is the issue is to escape the real debate and hide in the comfort zone of the things we have always said to each other in times of difficulty .
there is not some division between the europe necessary to succeed economically and social europe .
political europe and economic europe do not live in separate rooms .
the purpose of social europe and economic europe should be to sustain each other .
the purpose of political europe should be to promote the democratic and effective institutions to develop policy in these two spheres and across the board where we want and need to cooperate in our mutual interest .
but the purpose of political leadership is to get the policies right for today 's world .
for 50 years europe 's leaders have done that .
we talk of crisis .
let us first talk of achievement .
when the war ended , europe was in ruins .
today the eu stands as a monument to political achievement .
almost 50 years of peace , 50 years of prosperity , 50 years of progress .
think of it and be grateful .
the broad sweep of history is on the side of the eu .
countries round the world are coming together because in collective cooperation they increase individual strength .
until the second half of the 20th century , for centuries european nations individually had dominated the world , colonised large parts of it , fought wars against each other for world supremacy .
out of the carnage of the second world war , political leaders had the vision to realise those days were gone .
today 's world does not diminish that vision .
it demonstrates its prescience .
the usa is the world 's only super power .
but china and india in a few decades will be the world 's largest economies , each of them with populations three times that of the whole of the eu .
the idea of europe , united and working together , is essential for our nations to be strong enough to keep our place in this world .
now , almost 50 years on , we have to renew .
there is no shame in that .
all institutions must do it .
and we can .
but only if we remarry the european ideals we believe in with the modern world we live in .
if europe defaulted to euro scepticism , or if european nations faced with this immense challenge , decide to huddle together , hoping we can avoid globalisation , shrink away from confronting the changes around us , take refuge in the present policies of europe as if by constantly repeating them , we would by the very act of repetition make them more relevant , then we risk failure .
failure on a grand , strategic , scale .
this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognise that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support amongst the people .
and as ever the people are ahead of the politicians .
we always think as a political class that people , unconcerned with the daily obsession of politics , may not understand it , may not see its subtleties and its complexities .
but , ultimately , people always see politics more clearly than us .
precisely because they are not daily obsessed with it .
the issue is not about the idea of the european union .
it is about modernisation .
it is about policy .
it is not a debate about how to abandon europe but how to make it do what it was set up to do : improve the lives of people .
and right now , they are n't convinced .
consider this .
for four years europe conducted a debate over our new constitution , two years of it in the convention .
it was a detailed and careful piece of work setting out the new rules to govern a europe of 25 and in time 27 , 28 and more member states .
it was endorsed by all governments .
it was supported by all leaders .
it was then comprehensively rejected in referendums in two founding member states , in the case of the netherlands by over 60 per cent .
the reality is that in most member states it would be hard today to secure a ' yes ' for it in a referendum .
there are two possible explanations .
one is that people studied the constitution and disagreed with its precise articles .
i doubt that was the basis of the majority ' no ' .
this was not an issue of bad drafting or specific textual disagreement .
the other explanation is that the constitution became merely the vehicle for the people to register a wider and deeper discontent with the state of affairs in europe .
i believe this to be the correct analysis .
if so , it is not a crisis of political institutions , it is a crisis of political leadership .
people in europe are posing hard questions to us .
they worry about globalisation , job security , about pensions and living standards .
they see not just their economy but their society changing around them .
traditional communities are broken up , ethnic patterns change , family life is under strain as families struggle to balance work and home .
we are living through an era of profound upheaval and change .
look at our children and the technology they use and the jobs market they face .
the world is unrecognisable from that we experienced as students 20 , 30 years ago .
when such change occurs , moderate people must give leadership .
if they do n't , the extremes gain traction on the political process .
it happens within a nation .
it is happening in europe now .
just reflect .
the laeken declaration which launched the constitution was designed " to bring europe closer to the people " .
did it ?
the lisbon agenda was launched in the year 2000 with the ambition of making europe " the most competitive place to do business in the world by 2010 " .
we are half way through that period .
has it succeeded ?
i have sat through council conclusions after council conclusions describing how we are " reconnecting europe to the people " .
are we ?
it is time to give ourselves a reality check .
to receive the wake-up call .
the people are blowing the trumpets round the city walls .
are we listening ?
have we the political will to go out and meet them so that they regard our leadership as part of the solution not the problem ?
that is the context in which the budget debate should be set .
people say : we need the budget to restore europe 's credibility .
of course we do .
but it should be the right budget .
it should n't be abstracted from the debate about europe 's crisis .
it should be part of the answer to it .
i want to say a word about last friday 's summit .
there have been suggestions that i was not willing to compromise on the uk rebate ; that i only raised cap reform at the last minute ; that i expected to renegotiate the cap on friday night .
in fact i am the only british leader that has ever said i would put the rebate on the table .
i never said we should end the cap now or renegotiate it overnight .
such a position would be absurd .
any change must take account of the legitimate needs of farming communities and happen over time .
i have said simply two things : that we can not agree a new financial perspective that does not at least set out a process that leads to a more rational budget ; and that this must allow such a budget to shape the second half of that perspective up to 2013 .
otherwise it will be 2014 before any fundamental change is agreed , let alone implemented .
again , in the meantime , of course britain will pay its fair share of enlargement .
i might point out that on any basis we would remain the second highest net contributor to the eu , having in this perspective paid billions more than similar sized countries .
so , that is the context .
what would a different policy agenda for europe look like ?
first , it would modernise our social model .
again some have suggested i want to abandon europe 's social model .
but tell me : what type of social model is it that has 20m unemployed in europe , productivity rates falling behind those of the usa ; that is allowing more science graduates to be produced by india than by europe ; and that , on any relative index of a modern economy - skills , r & d , patents , it , is going down not up .
india will expand its biotechnology sector fivefold in the next five years .
china has trebled its spending on r & d in the last five .
of the top 20 universities in the world today , only two are now in europe .
the purpose of our social model should be to enhance our ability to compete , to help our people cope with globalisation , to let them embrace its opportunities and avoid its dangers .
of course we need a social europe .
but it must be a social europe that works .
and we 've been told how to do it .
the kok report in 2004 shows the way .
investment in knowledge , in skills , in active labour market policies , in science parks and innovation , in higher education , in urban regeneration , in help for small businesses .
this is modern social policy , not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future .
and since this is a day for demolishing caricatures , let me demolish one other : the idea that britain is in the grip of some extreme anglo-saxon market philosophy that tramples on the poor and disadvantaged .
the present british government has introduced the new deal for the unemployed , the largest jobs programme in europe that has seen long-term youth unemployment virtually abolished .
it has increased investment in our public services more than any other european country in the past five years .
we needed to , it is true , but we did it .
we have introduced britain 's first minimum wage .
we have regenerated our cities .
we have lifted almost one million children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship and are embarked on the most radical expansion of childcare , maternity and paternity rights in our country 's history .
it is just that we have done it on the basis of and not at the expense of a strong economy .
secondly , let the budget reflect these realities .
again the sapir report shows the way .
published by the european commission in 2003 , it sets out in clear detail what a modern european budget would look like .
put it into practice .
but a modern budget for europe is not one that 10 years from now is still spending 40 per cent of its money on the cap .
thirdly , implement the lisbon agenda .
on jobs , labour market participation , school leavers , lifelong learning , we are making progress that nowhere near matches the precise targets we set out at lisbon .
that agenda told us what to do .
let us do it .
fourth , and here i tread carefully , get a macroeconomic framework for europe that is disciplined but also flexible .
it is not for me to comment on the eurozone .
i just say this : if we agreed real progress on economic reform , if we demonstrated real seriousness on structural change , then people would perceive reform of macro policy as sensible and rational , not a product of fiscal laxity but of commonsense .
and we need such reform urgently if europe is to grow .
after the economic and social challenges , then let us confront another set of linked issues - crime , security and immigration .
crime is now crossing borders more easily than ever before .
organised crime costs the uk at least £ 20bn annually .
migration has doubled in the past 20 years .
much of the migration is healthy and welcome .
but it must he managed .
illegal immigration is an issue for all our nations , and a human tragedy for many thousands of people .
it is estimated that 70 per cent of illegal immigrants have their passage facilitated by organised crime groups .
then there is the repugnant practice of human trafficking whereby organised gangs move people from one region to another with the intention of exploiting them when they arrive .
between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked globally each year .
every year over 100,000 women are victims of trafficking in the european union .
again , a relevant jha agenda would focus on these issues : implementing the eu action plan on counter-terrorism which has huge potential to improve law enforcement as well as addressing the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists ; cross-border intelligence and policing on organised crime ; developing proposals to hit the people and drug traffickers hard , in opening up their bank accounts , harassing their activities , arresting their leading members and bring them to justice ; getting returns agreements for failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries and others ; developing biometric technology to make europe 's borders secure .
then there is the whole area of cfsp .
we should be agreeing practical measures to enhance european defence capability , be prepared to take on more missions of peacekeeping and enforcement , develop the capability , with nato or where nato does not want to be engaged outside it , to be able to intervene quickly and effectively in support of conflict resolution .
look at the numbers in european armies today and our expenditure .
do they really answer the strategic needs of today ?
such a defence policy is a necessary part of an effective foreign policy .
but even without it , we should be seeing how we can make europe 's influence count .
when the european union agreed recently a doubling of aid to africa , it was an immediate boost not just for that troubled continent , but for european cooperation .
we are world leaders in development and proud of it .
we should be leading the way on promoting a new multi-lateral trade agreement which will increase trade for all , especially the poorest nations .
we are leading the debate on climate change and developing pan-european policies to tackle it .
thanks to xavier solana , europe has started to make its presence felt in the mepp .
but my point is very simple .
a strong europe would be an active player in foreign policy , a good partner of course to the us but also capable of demonstrating its own capacity to shape and move the world forward .
such a europe - its economy in the process of being modernised , its security enhanced by clear action within our borders and beyond - would be a confident europe .
it would be a europe confident enough to see enlargement not as a threat , as if membership were a zero sum game in which old members lose as new members gain , but an extraordinary , historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful union .
because be under no illusion : if we stop enlargement or shut out its natural consequences , it would n't , in the end , save one job , keep one firm in business , prevent one delocalisation .
for a time it might but not for long .
and in the meantime europe will become more narrow , more introspective and those who garner support will be those no in the traditions of european idealism but in those of outdated nationalism and xenophobia .
but i tell you in all frankness : it is a contradiction to be in favour of liberalising europe 's membership but against opening up its economy .
if we set out that clear direction ; if we then combined it with the commission - as this one under jose manuel barroso 's leadership is fully capable of doing - that is prepared to send back some of the unnecessary regulation , peel back some of the bureaucracy and become a champion of a global , outward-looking , competitive europe , then it will not be hard to capture the imagination and support of the people of europe .
in our presidency , we will try to take forward the budget deal ; to resolve some of the hard dossiers , like the services directive and working time directive ; to carry out the union 's obligations to those like turkey and croatia that wait in hope of a future as part of europe ; and to conduct this debate about the future of europe in an open , inclusive way , giving our own views strongly but fully respectful of the views of others .
only one thing i ask : do n't let us kid ourselves that this debate is unnecessary ; that if only we assume ' business as usual ' , people will sooner or later relent and acquiesce in europe s it is , not as they want it to be .
in my time as prime minister , i have found that the hard part is not taking the decision , it is spotting when it has to be taken .
it is understanding the difference between the challenges that have to be managed and those that have to be confronted and overcome .
this is such a moment of decision for europe .
the people of europe are speaking to us .
they are posing the questions .
they are wanting our leadership .
it is time we gave it to them .

investment in knowledge , in skills , in active labour market policies , in science parks and innovation , in higher education , in urban regeneration , in help for small businesses .
this is modern social policy , not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future .
and since this is a day for demolishing caricatures , let me demolish one other : the idea that britain is in the grip of some extreme anglo-saxon market philosophy that tramples on the poor and disadvantaged .
the present british government has introduced the new deal for the unemployed , the largest jobs programme in europe that has seen long-term youth unemployment virtually abolished .
it has increased investment in our public services more than any other european country in the past five years .
we needed to , it is true , but we did it .
we have introduced britain 's first minimum wage .
we have regenerated our cities .
we have lifted almost one million children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship and are embarked on the most radical expansion of childcare , maternity and paternity rights in our country 's history .
it is just that we have done it on the basis of and not at the expense of a strong economy .
secondly , let the budget reflect these realities .
again the sapir report shows the way .
published by the european commission in 2003 , it sets out in clear detail what a modern european budget would look like .
put it into practice .
but a modern budget for europe is not one that 10 years from now is still spending 40 per cent of its money on the cap .
thirdly , implement the lisbon agenda .
on jobs , labour market participation , school leavers , lifelong learning , we are making progress that nowhere near matches the precise targets we set out at lisbon .
that agenda told us what to do .
let us do it .
fourth , and here i tread carefully , get a macroeconomic framework for europe that is disciplined but also flexible .
it is not for me to comment on the eurozone .
i just say this : if we agreed real progress on economic reform , if we demonstrated real seriousness on structural change , then people would perceive reform of macro policy as sensible and rational , not a product of fiscal laxity but of commonsense .
and we need such reform urgently if europe is to grow .
after the economic and social challenges , then let us confront another set of linked issues - crime , security and immigration .
crime is now crossing borders more easily than ever before .
organised crime costs the uk at least £ 20bn annually .
migration has doubled in the past 20 years .
much of the migration is healthy and welcome .
but it must he managed .
illegal immigration is an issue for all our nations , and a human tragedy for many thousands of people .
it is estimated that 70 per cent of illegal immigrants have their passage facilitated by organised crime groups .
then there is the repugnant practice of human trafficking whereby organised gangs move people from one region to another with the intention of exploiting them when they arrive .
between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked globally each year .
every year over 100,000 women are victims of trafficking in the european union .
again , a relevant jha agenda would focus on these issues : implementing the eu action plan on counter-terrorism which has huge potential to improve law enforcement as well as addressing the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists ; cross-border intelligence and policing on organised crime ; developing proposals to hit the people and drug traffickers hard , in opening up their bank accounts , harassing their activities , arresting their leading members and bring them to justice ; getting returns agreements for failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries and others ; developing biometric technology to make europe 's borders secure .
then there is the whole area of cfsp .
we should be agreeing practical measures to enhance european defence capability , be prepared to take on more missions of peacekeeping and enforcement , develop the capability , with nato or where nato does not want to be engaged outside it , to be able to intervene quickly and effectively in support of conflict resolution .
look at the numbers in european armies today and our expenditure .
do they really answer the strategic needs of today ?
such a defence policy is a necessary part of an effective foreign policy .
but even without it , we should be seeing how we can make europe 's influence count .
when the european union agreed recently a doubling of aid to africa , it was an immediate boost not just for that troubled continent , but for european cooperation .
we are world leaders in development and proud of it .
we should be leading the way on promoting a new multi-lateral trade agreement which will increase trade for all , especially the poorest nations .
we are leading the debate on climate change and developing pan-european policies to tackle it .
thanks to xavier solana , europe has started to make its presence felt in the mepp .
but my point is very simple .
a strong europe would be an active player in foreign policy , a good partner of course to the us but also capable of demonstrating its own capacity to shape and move the world forward .
such a europe - its economy in the process of being modernised , its security enhanced by clear action within our borders and beyond - would be a confident europe .
it would be a europe confident enough to see enlargement not as a threat , as if membership were a zero sum game in which old members lose as new members gain , but an extraordinary , historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful union .
because be under no illusion : if we stop enlargement or shut out its natural consequences , it would n't , in the end , save one job , keep one firm in business , prevent one delocalisation .
for a time it might but not for long .
and in the meantime europe will become more narrow , more introspective and those who garner support will be those no in the traditions of european idealism but in those of outdated nationalism and xenophobia .
but i tell you in all frankness : it is a contradiction to be in favour of liberalising europe 's membership but against opening up its economy .
if we set out that clear direction ; if we then combined it with the commission - as this one under jose manuel barroso 's leadership is fully capable of doing - that is prepared to send back some of the unnecessary regulation , peel back some of the bureaucracy and become a champion of a global , outward-looking , competitive europe , then it will not be hard to capture the imagination and support of the people of europe .
in our presidency , we will try to take forward the budget deal ; to resolve some of the hard dossiers , like the services directive and working time directive ; to carry out the union 's obligations to those like turkey and croatia that wait in hope of a future as part of europe ; and to conduct this debate about the future of europe in an open , inclusive way , giving our own views strongly but fully respectful of the views of others .
only one thing i ask : do n't let us kid ourselves that this debate is unnecessary ; that if only we assume ' business as usual ' , people will sooner or later relent and acquiesce in europe s it is , not as they want it to be .
in my time as prime minister , i have found that the hard part is not taking the decision , it is spotting when it has to be taken .
it is understanding the difference between the challenges that have to be managed and those that have to be confronted and overcome .
this is such a moment of decision for europe .
the people of europe are speaking to us .
they are posing the questions .
they are wanting our leadership .
it is time we gave it to them .

with your permission , i will come back after each european council during the uk presidency and report to you .
in addition , i would be happy to consult the parliament before each council , so as to have the benefit of the views of the european parliament before council deliberations .
this is a timely address .
whatever else people disagree upon in europe today , they at least agree on one point : europe is in the midst of a profound debate about its future .
i want to talk to you plainly today about this debate , the reasons for it and how to resolve it .
in every crisis there is an opportunity .
there is one here for europe now , if we have the courage to take it .
the debate over europe should not be conducted by trading insults or in terms of personality .
it should be an open and frank exchange of ideas .
and right at the outset i want to describe clearly how i define the debate and the disagreement underlying it .
the issue is not between a " free market " europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project .
this is not just a misrepresentation .
it is to intimidate those who want change in europe by representing the desire for change as betrayal of the european ideal , to try to shut off serious debate about europe 's future by claiming that the very insistence on debate is to embrace the anti-europe .
it is a mindset i have fought against all my political life .
ideals survive through change .
they die through inertia in the face of challenge .
i am a passionate pro-european .
i always have been .
my first vote was in 1975 in the british referendum on membership and i voted yes .
in 1983 , when i was the last candidate in the uk to be selected shortly before that election and when my party had a policy of withdrawing from europe , i told the selection conference that i disagreed with the policy .
some thought i had lost the selection .
some perhaps wish i had .
i then helped change our policy in the 1980 's and was proud of that change .
since being prime minister i signed the social chapter , helped , along with france , to create the modern european defence policy , have played my part in the amsterdam , the nice , then the rome treaties .
this is a union of values , of solidarity between nations and people , of not just a common market in which we trade but a common political space in which we live as citizens .
it always will be .
i believe in europe as a political project .
i believe in europe with a strong and caring social dimension .
i would never accept a europe that was simply an economic market .
to say that is the issue is to escape the real debate and hide in the comfort zone of the things we have always said to each other in times of difficulty .
there is not some division between the europe necessary to succeed economically and social europe .
political europe and economic europe do not live in separate rooms .
the purpose of social europe and economic europe should be to sustain each other .
the purpose of political europe should be to promote the democratic and effective institutions to develop policy in these two spheres and across the board where we want and need to cooperate in our mutual interest .
but the purpose of political leadership is to get the policies right for today 's world .
for 50 years europe 's leaders have done that .
we talk of crisis .
let us first talk of achievement .
when the war ended , europe was in ruins .
today the eu stands as a monument to political achievement .
almost 50 years of peace , 50 years of prosperity , 50 years of progress .
think of it and be grateful .
the broad sweep of history is on the side of the eu .
countries round the world are coming together because in collective cooperation they increase individual strength .
until the second half of the 20th century , for centuries european nations individually had dominated the world , colonised large parts of it , fought wars against each other for world supremacy .
out of the carnage of the second world war , political leaders had the vision to realise those days were gone .
today 's world does not diminish that vision .
it demonstrates its prescience .
the usa is the world 's only super power .
but china and india in a few decades will be the world 's largest economies , each of them with populations three times that of the whole of the eu .
the idea of europe , united and working together , is essential for our nations to be strong enough to keep our place in this world .
now , almost 50 years on , we have to renew .
there is no shame in that .
all institutions must do it .
and we can .
but only if we remarry the european ideals we believe in with the modern world we live in .
if europe defaulted to euro scepticism , or if european nations faced with this immense challenge , decide to huddle together , hoping we can avoid globalisation , shrink away from confronting the changes around us , take refuge in the present policies of europe as if by constantly repeating them , we would by the very act of repetition make them more relevant , then we risk failure .
failure on a grand , strategic , scale .
this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognise that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support amongst the people .
and as ever the people are ahead of the politicians .
we always think as a political class that people , unconcerned with the daily obsession of politics , may not understand it , may not see its subtleties and its complexities .
but , ultimately , people always see politics more clearly than us .
precisely because they are not daily obsessed with it .
the issue is not about the idea of the european union .
it is about modernisation .
it is about policy .
it is not a debate about how to abandon europe but how to make it do what it was set up to do : improve the lives of people .
and right now , they are n't convinced .
consider this .
for four years europe conducted a debate over our new constitution , two years of it in the convention .
it was a detailed and careful piece of work setting out the new rules to govern a europe of 25 and in time 27 , 28 and more member states .
it was endorsed by all governments .
it was supported by all leaders .
it was then comprehensively rejected in referendums in two founding member states , in the case of the netherlands by over 60 per cent .
the reality is that in most member states it would be hard today to secure a ' yes ' for it in a referendum .
there are two possible explanations .
one is that people studied the constitution and disagreed with its precise articles .
i doubt that was the basis of the majority ' no ' .
this was not an issue of bad drafting or specific textual disagreement .
the other explanation is that the constitution became merely the vehicle for the people to register a wider and deeper discontent with the state of affairs in europe .
i believe this to be the correct analysis .
if so , it is not a crisis of political institutions , it is a crisis of political leadership .
people in europe are posing hard questions to us .
they worry about globalisation , job security , about pensions and living standards .
they see not just their economy but their society changing around them .
traditional communities are broken up , ethnic patterns change , family life is under strain as families struggle to balance work and home .
we are living through an era of profound upheaval and change .
look at our children and the technology they use and the jobs market they face .
the world is unrecognisable from that we experienced as students 20 , 30 years ago .
when such change occurs , moderate people must give leadership .
if they do n't , the extremes gain traction on the political process .
it happens within a nation .
it is happening in europe now .
just reflect .
the laeken declaration which launched the constitution was designed " to bring europe closer to the people " .
did it ?
the lisbon agenda was launched in the year 2000 with the ambition of making europe " the most competitive place to do business in the world by 2010 " .
we are half way through that period .
has it succeeded ?
i have sat through council conclusions after council conclusions describing how we are " reconnecting europe to the people " .
are we ?
it is time to give ourselves a reality check .
to receive the wake-up call .
the people are blowing the trumpets round the city walls .
are we listening ?
have we the political will to go out and meet them so that they regard our leadership as part of the solution not the problem ?
that is the context in which the budget debate should be set .
people say : we need the budget to restore europe 's credibility .
of course we do .
but it should be the right budget .
it should n't be abstracted from the debate about europe 's crisis .
it should be part of the answer to it .
i want to say a word about last friday 's summit .
there have been suggestions that i was not willing to compromise on the uk rebate ; that i only raised cap reform at the last minute ; that i expected to renegotiate the cap on friday night .
in fact i am the only british leader that has ever said i would put the rebate on the table .
i never said we should end the cap now or renegotiate it overnight .
such a position would be absurd .
any change must take account of the legitimate needs of farming communities and happen over time .
i have said simply two things : that we can not agree a new financial perspective that does not at least set out a process that leads to a more rational budget ; and that this must allow such a budget to shape the second half of that perspective up to 2013 .
otherwise it will be 2014 before any fundamental change is agreed , let alone implemented .
again , in the meantime , of course britain will pay its fair share of enlargement .
i might point out that on any basis we would remain the second highest net contributor to the eu , having in this perspective paid billions more than similar sized countries .
so , that is the context .
what would a different policy agenda for europe look like ?
first , it would modernise our social model .
again some have suggested i want to abandon europe 's social model .
but tell me : what type of social model is it that has 20m unemployed in europe , productivity rates falling behind those of the usa ; that is allowing more science graduates to be produced by india than by europe ; and that , on any relative index of a modern economy - skills , r & d , patents , it , is going down not up .
india will expand its biotechnology sector fivefold in the next five years .
china has trebled its spending on r & d in the last five .
of the top 20 universities in the world today , only two are now in europe .
the purpose of our social model should be to enhance our ability to compete , to help our people cope with globalisation , to let them embrace its opportunities and avoid its dangers .
of course we need a social europe .
but it must be a social europe that works .
and we 've been told how to do it .
the kok report in 2004 shows the way .
investment in knowledge , in skills , in active labour market policies , in science parks and innovation , in higher education , in urban regeneration , in help for small businesses .
this is modern social policy , not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future .
and since this is a day for demolishing caricatures , let me demolish one other : the idea that britain is in the grip of some extreme anglo-saxon market philosophy that tramples on the poor and disadvantaged .

it has increased investment in our public services more than any other european country in the past five years .
we needed to , it is true , but we did it .
we have introduced britain 's first minimum wage .
we have regenerated our cities .
we have lifted almost one million children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship and are embarked on the most radical expansion of childcare , maternity and paternity rights in our country 's history .
it is just that we have done it on the basis of and not at the expense of a strong economy .
secondly , let the budget reflect these realities .

but a modern budget for europe is not one that 10 years from now is still spending 40 per cent of its money on the cap .

but only if we remarry the european ideals we believe in with the modern world we live in .
if europe defaulted to euro scepticism , or if european nations faced with this immense challenge , decide to huddle together , hoping we can avoid globalisation , shrink away from confronting the changes around us , take refuge in the present policies of europe as if by constantly repeating them , we would by the very act of repetition make them more relevant , then we risk failure .
failure on a grand , strategic , scale .
this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognise that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support amongst the people .
and as ever the people are ahead of the politicians .
we always think as a political class that people , unconcerned with the daily obsession of politics , may not understand it , may not see its subtleties and its complexities .
but , ultimately , people always see politics more clearly than us .
precisely because they are not daily obsessed with it .
the issue is not about the idea of the european union .
it is about modernisation .
it is about policy .
it is not a debate about how to abandon europe but how to make it do what it was set up to do : improve the lives of people .
and right now , they are n't convinced .
consider this .
for four years europe conducted a debate over our new constitution , two years of it in the convention .
it was a detailed and careful piece of work setting out the new rules to govern a europe of 25 and in time 27 , 28 and more member states .
it was endorsed by all governments .
it was supported by all leaders .
it was then comprehensively rejected in referendums in two founding member states , in the case of the netherlands by over 60 per cent .
the reality is that in most member states it would be hard today to secure a ' yes ' for it in a referendum .
there are two possible explanations .
one is that people studied the constitution and disagreed with its precise articles .
i doubt that was the basis of the majority ' no ' .
this was not an issue of bad drafting or specific textual disagreement .
the other explanation is that the constitution became merely the vehicle for the people to register a wider and deeper discontent with the state of affairs in europe .
i believe this to be the correct analysis .
if so , it is not a crisis of political institutions , it is a crisis of political leadership .
people in europe are posing hard questions to us .
they worry about globalisation , job security , about pensions and living standards .
they see not just their economy but their society changing around them .
traditional communities are broken up , ethnic patterns change , family life is under strain as families struggle to balance work and home .
we are living through an era of profound upheaval and change .
look at our children and the technology they use and the jobs market they face .
the world is unrecognisable from that we experienced as students 20 , 30 years ago .
when such change occurs , moderate people must give leadership .
if they do n't , the extremes gain traction on the political process .
it happens within a nation .
it is happening in europe now .
just reflect .
the laeken declaration which launched the constitution was designed " to bring europe closer to the people " .
did it ?
the lisbon agenda was launched in the year 2000 with the ambition of making europe " the most competitive place to do business in the world by 2010 " .
we are half way through that period .
has it succeeded ?
i have sat through council conclusions after council conclusions describing how we are " reconnecting europe to the people " .
are we ?
it is time to give ourselves a reality check .
to receive the wake-up call .
the people are blowing the trumpets round the city walls .
are we listening ?
have we the political will to go out and meet them so that they regard our leadership as part of the solution not the problem ?
that is the context in which the budget debate should be set .
people say : we need the budget to restore europe 's credibility .
of course we do .
but it should be the right budget .
it should n't be abstracted from the debate about europe 's crisis .
it should be part of the answer to it .
i want to say a word about last friday 's summit .
there have been suggestions that i was not willing to compromise on the uk rebate ; that i only raised cap reform at the last minute ; that i expected to renegotiate the cap on friday night .
in fact i am the only british leader that has ever said i would put the rebate on the table .
i never said we should end the cap now or renegotiate it overnight .
such a position would be absurd .
any change must take account of the legitimate needs of farming communities and happen over time .
i have said simply two things : that we can not agree a new financial perspective that does not at least set out a process that leads to a more rational budget ; and that this must allow such a budget to shape the second half of that perspective up to 2013 .
otherwise it will be 2014 before any fundamental change is agreed , let alone implemented .
again , in the meantime , of course britain will pay its fair share of enlargement .
i might point out that on any basis we would remain the second highest net contributor to the eu , having in this perspective paid billions more than similar sized countries .
so , that is the context .
what would a different policy agenda for europe look like ?
first , it would modernise our social model .
again some have suggested i want to abandon europe 's social model .
but tell me : what type of social model is it that has 20m unemployed in europe , productivity rates falling behind those of the usa ; that is allowing more science graduates to be produced by india than by europe ; and that , on any relative index of a modern economy - skills , r & d , patents , it , is going down not up .
india will expand its biotechnology sector fivefold in the next five years .
china has trebled its spending on r & d in the last five .
of the top 20 universities in the world today , only two are now in europe .
the purpose of our social model should be to enhance our ability to compete , to help our people cope with globalisation , to let them embrace its opportunities and avoid its dangers .
of course we need a social europe .
but it must be a social europe that works .
and we 've been told how to do it .
the kok report in 2004 shows the way .
investment in knowledge , in skills , in active labour market policies , in science parks and innovation , in higher education , in urban regeneration , in help for small businesses .
this is modern social policy , not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future .
and since this is a day for demolishing caricatures , let me demolish one other : the idea that britain is in the grip of some extreme anglo-saxon market philosophy that tramples on the poor and disadvantaged .
the present british government has introduced the new deal for the unemployed , the largest jobs programme in europe that has seen long-term youth unemployment virtually abolished .
it has increased investment in our public services more than any other european country in the past five years .
we needed to , it is true , but we did it .
we have introduced britain 's first minimum wage .
we have regenerated our cities .
we have lifted almost one million children out of poverty and two million pensioners out of acute hardship and are embarked on the most radical expansion of childcare , maternity and paternity rights in our country 's history .
it is just that we have done it on the basis of and not at the expense of a strong economy .
secondly , let the budget reflect these realities .
again the sapir report shows the way .
published by the european commission in 2003 , it sets out in clear detail what a modern european budget would look like .
put it into practice .
but a modern budget for europe is not one that 10 years from now is still spending 40 per cent of its money on the cap .
thirdly , implement the lisbon agenda .
on jobs , labour market participation , school leavers , lifelong learning , we are making progress that nowhere near matches the precise targets we set out at lisbon .
that agenda told us what to do .
let us do it .
fourth , and here i tread carefully , get a macroeconomic framework for europe that is disciplined but also flexible .
it is not for me to comment on the eurozone .
i just say this : if we agreed real progress on economic reform , if we demonstrated real seriousness on structural change , then people would perceive reform of macro policy as sensible and rational , not a product of fiscal laxity but of commonsense .
and we need such reform urgently if europe is to grow .
after the economic and social challenges , then let us confront another set of linked issues - crime , security and immigration .
crime is now crossing borders more easily than ever before .
organised crime costs the uk at least £ 20bn annually .
migration has doubled in the past 20 years .
much of the migration is healthy and welcome .
but it must he managed .
illegal immigration is an issue for all our nations , and a human tragedy for many thousands of people .
it is estimated that 70 per cent of illegal immigrants have their passage facilitated by organised crime groups .
then there is the repugnant practice of human trafficking whereby organised gangs move people from one region to another with the intention of exploiting them when they arrive .
between 600,000 and 800,000 people are trafficked globally each year .
every year over 100,000 women are victims of trafficking in the european union .
again , a relevant jha agenda would focus on these issues : implementing the eu action plan on counter-terrorism which has huge potential to improve law enforcement as well as addressing the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists ; cross-border intelligence and policing on organised crime ; developing proposals to hit the people and drug traffickers hard , in opening up their bank accounts , harassing their activities , arresting their leading members and bring them to justice ; getting returns agreements for failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries and others ; developing biometric technology to make europe 's borders secure .
then there is the whole area of cfsp .
we should be agreeing practical measures to enhance european defence capability , be prepared to take on more missions of peacekeeping and enforcement , develop the capability , with nato or where nato does not want to be engaged outside it , to be able to intervene quickly and effectively in support of conflict resolution .
look at the numbers in european armies today and our expenditure .
do they really answer the strategic needs of today ?
such a defence policy is a necessary part of an effective foreign policy .
but even without it , we should be seeing how we can make europe 's influence count .
when the european union agreed recently a doubling of aid to africa , it was an immediate boost not just for that troubled continent , but for european cooperation .
we are world leaders in development and proud of it .
we should be leading the way on promoting a new multi-lateral trade agreement which will increase trade for all , especially the poorest nations .
we are leading the debate on climate change and developing pan-european policies to tackle it .
thanks to xavier solana , europe has started to make its presence felt in the mepp .
but my point is very simple .
a strong europe would be an active player in foreign policy , a good partner of course to the us but also capable of demonstrating its own capacity to shape and move the world forward .
such a europe - its economy in the process of being modernised , its security enhanced by clear action within our borders and beyond - would be a confident europe .
it would be a europe confident enough to see enlargement not as a threat , as if membership were a zero sum game in which old members lose as new members gain , but an extraordinary , historic opportunity to build a greater and more powerful union .
because be under no illusion : if we stop enlargement or shut out its natural consequences , it would n't , in the end , save one job , keep one firm in business , prevent one delocalisation .
for a time it might but not for long .
and in the meantime europe will become more narrow , more introspective and those who garner support will be those no in the traditions of european idealism but in those of outdated nationalism and xenophobia .
but i tell you in all frankness : it is a contradiction to be in favour of liberalising europe 's membership but against opening up its economy .
if we set out that clear direction ; if we then combined it with the commission - as this one under jose manuel barroso 's leadership is fully capable of doing - that is prepared to send back some of the unnecessary regulation , peel back some of the bureaucracy and become a champion of a global , outward-looking , competitive europe , then it will not be hard to capture the imagination and support of the people of europe .
in our presidency , we will try to take forward the budget deal ; to resolve some of the hard dossiers , like the services directive and working time directive ; to carry out the union 's obligations to those like turkey and croatia that wait in hope of a future as part of europe ; and to conduct this debate about the future of europe in an open , inclusive way , giving our own views strongly but fully respectful of the views of others .
only one thing i ask : do n't let us kid ourselves that this debate is unnecessary ; that if only we assume ' business as usual ' , people will sooner or later relent and acquiesce in europe s it is , not as they want it to be .
in my time as prime minister , i have found that the hard part is not taking the decision , it is spotting when it has to be taken .
it is understanding the difference between the challenges that have to be managed and those that have to be confronted and overcome .
this is such a moment of decision for europe .
the people of europe are speaking to us .
they are posing the questions .
they are wanting our leadership .
it is time we gave it to them .

with your permission , i will come back after each european council during the uk presidency and report to you .
in addition , i would be happy to consult the parliament before each council , so as to have the benefit of the views of the european parliament before council deliberations .
this is a timely address .
whatever else people disagree upon in europe today , they at least agree on one point : europe is in the midst of a profound debate about its future .
i want to talk to you plainly today about this debate , the reasons for it and how to resolve it .
in every crisis there is an opportunity .
there is one here for europe now , if we have the courage to take it .
the debate over europe should not be conducted by trading insults or in terms of personality .
it should be an open and frank exchange of ideas .
and right at the outset i want to describe clearly how i define the debate and the disagreement underlying it .
the issue is not between a " free market " europe and a social europe , between those who want to retreat to a common market and those who believe in europe as a political project .
this is not just a misrepresentation .
it is to intimidate those who want change in europe by representing the desire for change as betrayal of the european ideal , to try to shut off serious debate about europe 's future by claiming that the very insistence on debate is to embrace the anti-europe .
it is a mindset i have fought against all my political life .
ideals survive through change .
they die through inertia in the face of challenge .
i am a passionate pro-european .
i always have been .
my first vote was in 1975 in the british referendum on membership and i voted yes .
in 1983 , when i was the last candidate in the uk to be selected shortly before that election and when my party had a policy of withdrawing from europe , i told the selection conference that i disagreed with the policy .
some thought i had lost the selection .
some perhaps wish i had .
i then helped change our policy in the 1980 's and was proud of that change .
since being prime minister i signed the social chapter , helped , along with france , to create the modern european defence policy , have played my part in the amsterdam , the nice , then the rome treaties .
this is a union of values , of solidarity between nations and people , of not just a common market in which we trade but a common political space in which we live as citizens .
it always will be .
i believe in europe as a political project .
i believe in europe with a strong and caring social dimension .
i would never accept a europe that was simply an economic market .
to say that is the issue is to escape the real debate and hide in the comfort zone of the things we have always said to each other in times of difficulty .
there is not some division between the europe necessary to succeed economically and social europe .
political europe and economic europe do not live in separate rooms .
the purpose of social europe and economic europe should be to sustain each other .
the purpose of political europe should be to promote the democratic and effective institutions to develop policy in these two spheres and across the board where we want and need to cooperate in our mutual interest .
but the purpose of political leadership is to get the policies right for today 's world .
for 50 years europe 's leaders have done that .
we talk of crisis .
let us first talk of achievement .
when the war ended , europe was in ruins .
today the eu stands as a monument to political achievement .
almost 50 years of peace , 50 years of prosperity , 50 years of progress .
think of it and be grateful .
the broad sweep of history is on the side of the eu .
countries round the world are coming together because in collective cooperation they increase individual strength .
until the second half of the 20th century , for centuries european nations individually had dominated the world , colonised large parts of it , fought wars against each other for world supremacy .
out of the carnage of the second world war , political leaders had the vision to realise those days were gone .
today 's world does not diminish that vision .
it demonstrates its prescience .
the usa is the world 's only super power .
but china and india in a few decades will be the world 's largest economies , each of them with populations three times that of the whole of the eu .
the idea of europe , united and working together , is essential for our nations to be strong enough to keep our place in this world .
now , almost 50 years on , we have to renew .
there is no shame in that .
all institutions must do it .
and we can .
but only if we remarry the european ideals we believe in with the modern world we live in .
if europe defaulted to euro scepticism , or if european nations faced with this immense challenge , decide to huddle together , hoping we can avoid globalisation , shrink away from confronting the changes around us , take refuge in the present policies of europe as if by constantly repeating them , we would by the very act of repetition make them more relevant , then we risk failure .
failure on a grand , strategic , scale .
this is not a time to accuse those who want europe to change of betraying europe .
it is a time to recognise that only by change will europe recover its strength , its relevance , its idealism and therefore its support amongst the people .
and as ever the people are ahead of the politicians .
we always think as a political class that people , unconcerned with the daily obsession of politics , may not understand it , may not see its subtleties and its complexities .
but , ultimately , people always see politics more clearly than us .
precisely because they are not daily obsessed with it .
the issue is not about the idea of the european union .
it is about modernisation .
it is about policy .
it is not a debate about how to abandon europe but how to make it do what it was set up to do : improve the lives of people .
and right now , they are n't convinced .
