will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .

" it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .
the text does not say which countries should become permanent members but proposes two for asia , two for africa , one for western europe and one for latin america .
africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .
on thursday , he again demanded that other countries not " interfere " and signaled he was ready to go again . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "

he is still trying to put together the team pieces so that germany can reach his stated goal at the world cup 2006 , namely the final .
" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .
injuries a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's miroslav klose was the second highest goalscorer at world cup 2002 for some players , nagging injuries present the biggest problem .
germany 's top scorer in south korea and japan three years ago , miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- from werder bremen , left the training camp this week to have his right knee operated on .
along with midfielder dietmar hamann from champions league victor liverpool and defender philip lahm , some key players will be missing from the german roster in the june tournament .
but are the hectic schedules responsible for the injuries and burnouts ?
rainer holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , said things could be better organized .
" with reasonable practice schedules and vacations place properly , it should be possible for a player to deal with the schedule , " he said but added that playing the confederations cup one year before the world cup is not reasonable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clubs want piece of fifa pie in switzerland , a legal case between fifa and europe 's richest clubs could lead to a redistribution of power , if not wealth .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "

he is still trying to put together the team pieces so that germany can reach his stated goal at the world cup 2006 , namely the final .
" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .
injuries a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's miroslav klose was the second highest goalscorer at world cup 2002 for some players , nagging injuries present the biggest problem .
germany 's top scorer in south korea and japan three years ago , miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- from werder bremen , left the training camp this week to have his right knee operated on .
along with midfielder dietmar hamann from champions league victor liverpool and defender philip lahm , some key players will be missing from the german roster in the june tournament .
but are the hectic schedules responsible for the injuries and burnouts ?
rainer holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , said things could be better organized .
" with reasonable practice schedules and vacations place properly , it should be possible for a player to deal with the schedule , " he said but added that playing the confederations cup one year before the world cup is not reasonable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clubs want piece of fifa pie in switzerland , a legal case between fifa and europe 's richest clubs could lead to a redistribution of power , if not wealth .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .
while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .
while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .
while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .

then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head .
schröder and merkel " ten years ago , germany would not have said yes to a woman , which suggests that women have greater chances today , " she said .
" but women who do get to the top have to fit in with male behavior .
merkel has learned , as a woman , how to acquire and use power , how to develop strategies and how to get her own way . "
angela merkel 's public persona is well-worn and gaining popularity , with the latest polls putting already putting her ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder . but voters will have the final say in september . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- election 2005 after his social democratic party suffered defeat in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 , german chancellor gerhard schröder announced he wanted early elections to put his reform course before voters .
schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .

dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .

" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .

there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .

she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .

" the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .

" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .

she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2005 euro caught in constitution crossfire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu constitution crisis drag down the single currency ?
will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added . " of course , nobody can confidently predict the endgame of such developments . " nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .
ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .

the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "

he is still trying to put together the team pieces so that germany can reach his stated goal at the world cup 2006 , namely the final .
" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2005 schröder 's shuttle diplomacy to save eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could a bit of magic save the eu constitution ?
germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- ironically , if schröder does manage to save the constitution , it could be virtually his last act as german chancellor . in the wake of a devastating state election defeat for his social democrats last month , he called a no confidence vote in his government on july 1 which will almost certainly lead to an early general election in september . opinion polls currently show that the opposition conservative christian democrats , led by angela merkel , will win . while germany will watch the developments both at home and in europe closely , so will bulgaria and romania who are hoping that the current eu crisis and the compromised standing of the current german chancellor does not put their accession bids in jeopardy . on friday schröder threw his support behind the attempts of romania and bulgaria to join the european union , despite concerns in the rest of the bloc that it is growing too fast . " there are differing opinions about the entry of romania and bulgaria into the eu , as well as about the start of negotiations with turkey , but i remain convinced that we must support these moves , " schröder said after meeting the visiting romanian prime minister , calin tariceanu . eu hopefuls fear for schröder , europe though both countries count schröder as one of their most staunch supporters of their membership bids , a looming federal election that could replace him with a conservative alternative has struck fear . that may all be academic if current concerns over whether the dutch and french rejections of the constitution may put a freeze on enlargement become reality . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

not only college students are endangered , but also high school students .
if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .

but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .

" the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar .

" angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .

if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .

even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .

just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .

that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .
the text does not say which countries should become permanent members but proposes two for asia , two for africa , one for western europe and one for latin america .
africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .
on thursday , he again demanded that other countries not " interfere " and signaled he was ready to go again . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "

he is still trying to put together the team pieces so that germany can reach his stated goal at the world cup 2006 , namely the final .
" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head .
schröder and merkel " ten years ago , germany would not have said yes to a woman , which suggests that women have greater chances today , " she said .
" but women who do get to the top have to fit in with male behavior .
merkel has learned , as a woman , how to acquire and use power , how to develop strategies and how to get her own way . "
angela merkel 's public persona is well-worn and gaining popularity , with the latest polls putting already putting her ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder . but voters will have the final say in september . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2005 opinion : the eu constitution is dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wants to support the future eu ?
what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .

africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .

africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .
while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .
the text does not say which countries should become permanent members but proposes two for asia , two for africa , one for western europe and one for latin america .
africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .
on thursday , he again demanded that other countries not " interfere " and signaled he was ready to go again . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us reportedly opposed to berlin 's un bid us secretary of state condoleezza rice reportedly is opposed to germany 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .

put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .

the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .

it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .

dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said .

ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head .
schröder and merkel " ten years ago , germany would not have said yes to a woman , which suggests that women have greater chances today , " she said .
" but women who do get to the top have to fit in with male behavior .
merkel has learned , as a woman , how to acquire and use power , how to develop strategies and how to get her own way . "
angela merkel 's public persona is well-worn and gaining popularity , with the latest polls putting already putting her ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder . but voters will have the final say in september . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- election 2005 after his social democratic party suffered defeat in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 , german chancellor gerhard schröder announced he wanted early elections to put his reform course before voters .
schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .

some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .

" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .

there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .

as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .
i was arrested and sentenced to ten days ’ imprisonment .
three days later , i was expelled from the university , " said pavel . arthur told a similar tale : " they said i would n't be allowed to take an exam and a kgb agent went to my dean and put pressure on him . " crackdown against democracy both young men are active in the " youth front " organization .
about 2,000 people between 15 and 24 years of age belong to the group that works for democracy and human rights in their country .
since the beginning of the year , 33 young people have been dismissed from the university .
not only college students are endangered , but also high school students .
if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .
everything just got worse .
so we had to go on a hunger strike .
that ’ s our last hope , " said pavel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young demonstrators hold a slogan reading " down with tyranny " during a protest against belarusian president alexander lukashenko in central minsk , belarus , tuesday , oct .

the young people are demanding that the expelled students be permitted back in .
the motto of their protest is called " children want to learn " and their logo is a sun rising behind a school desk .
posters with the logo are all over city .
more and more young people are going on hunger strikes .
at the moment , the number stands at eleven , two of them are minors . this past weekend , the director of the university 's ideology department and a police officer visited the hunger-strikers , noted down their names , and suggested they stop .
but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .
we have to stick together right now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2005 opinion : the eu constitution is dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wants to support the future eu ?
what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2005 euro caught in constitution crossfire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu constitution crisis drag down the single currency ?
will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added . " of course , nobody can confidently predict the endgame of such developments . " nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .
ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- expected french ' non ' hits euro the euro remained near seven-month lows thursday due to continuing concerns that france will vote against the eu constitution , an impression reinforced by reported comments from former finance minister nicolas sarkozy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.06.2005 opinion : the eu constitution is dead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who wants to support the future eu ?
what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu in agony after constitution fiasco europe is agonizing over the eu constitution 's future after dutch and french voters rejected it .
while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .
-lrb- june 2 , 2005 -rrb- europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .
i was arrested and sentenced to ten days ’ imprisonment .
three days later , i was expelled from the university , " said pavel . arthur told a similar tale : " they said i would n't be allowed to take an exam and a kgb agent went to my dean and put pressure on him .

about 2,000 people between 15 and 24 years of age belong to the group that works for democracy and human rights in their country .
since the beginning of the year , 33 young people have been dismissed from the university .
not only college students are endangered , but also high school students .
if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .

but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- ironically , if schröder does manage to save the constitution , it could be virtually his last act as german chancellor . in the wake of a devastating state election defeat for his social democrats last month , he called a no confidence vote in his government on july 1 which will almost certainly lead to an early general election in september . opinion polls currently show that the opposition conservative christian democrats , led by angela merkel , will win . while germany will watch the developments both at home and in europe closely , so will bulgaria and romania who are hoping that the current eu crisis and the compromised standing of the current german chancellor does not put their accession bids in jeopardy . on friday schröder threw his support behind the attempts of romania and bulgaria to join the european union , despite concerns in the rest of the bloc that it is growing too fast . " there are differing opinions about the entry of romania and bulgaria into the eu , as well as about the start of negotiations with turkey , but i remain convinced that we must support these moves , " schröder said after meeting the visiting romanian prime minister , calin tariceanu . eu hopefuls fear for schröder , europe though both countries count schröder as one of their most staunch supporters of their membership bids , a looming federal election that could replace him with a conservative alternative has struck fear . that may all be academic if current concerns over whether the dutch and french rejections of the constitution may put a freeze on enlargement become reality . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added . " of course , nobody can confidently predict the endgame of such developments . " nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .
ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .
i was arrested and sentenced to ten days ’ imprisonment .
three days later , i was expelled from the university , " said pavel . arthur told a similar tale : " they said i would n't be allowed to take an exam and a kgb agent went to my dean and put pressure on him . " crackdown against democracy both young men are active in the " youth front " organization .
about 2,000 people between 15 and 24 years of age belong to the group that works for democracy and human rights in their country .
since the beginning of the year , 33 young people have been dismissed from the university .
not only college students are endangered , but also high school students .
if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .
everything just got worse .

the motto of their protest is called " children want to learn " and their logo is a sun rising behind a school desk .

more and more young people are going on hunger strikes .
at the moment , the number stands at eleven , two of them are minors . this past weekend , the director of the university 's ideology department and a police officer visited the hunger-strikers , noted down their names , and suggested they stop .
but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- ironically , if schröder does manage to save the constitution , it could be virtually his last act as german chancellor . in the wake of a devastating state election defeat for his social democrats last month , he called a no confidence vote in his government on july 1 which will almost certainly lead to an early general election in september . opinion polls currently show that the opposition conservative christian democrats , led by angela merkel , will win . while germany will watch the developments both at home and in europe closely , so will bulgaria and romania who are hoping that the current eu crisis and the compromised standing of the current german chancellor does not put their accession bids in jeopardy . on friday schröder threw his support behind the attempts of romania and bulgaria to join the european union , despite concerns in the rest of the bloc that it is growing too fast . " there are differing opinions about the entry of romania and bulgaria into the eu , as well as about the start of negotiations with turkey , but i remain convinced that we must support these moves , " schröder said after meeting the visiting romanian prime minister , calin tariceanu . eu hopefuls fear for schröder , europe though both countries count schröder as one of their most staunch supporters of their membership bids , a looming federal election that could replace him with a conservative alternative has struck fear . that may all be academic if current concerns over whether the dutch and french rejections of the constitution may put a freeze on enlargement become reality . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .
the text does not say which countries should become permanent members but proposes two for asia , two for africa , one for western europe and one for latin america .
africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

-lrb- ap photo / jockel finck -rrb- ironically , if schröder does manage to save the constitution , it could be virtually his last act as german chancellor . in the wake of a devastating state election defeat for his social democrats last month , he called a no confidence vote in his government on july 1 which will almost certainly lead to an early general election in september . opinion polls currently show that the opposition conservative christian democrats , led by angela merkel , will win . while germany will watch the developments both at home and in europe closely , so will bulgaria and romania who are hoping that the current eu crisis and the compromised standing of the current german chancellor does not put their accession bids in jeopardy . on friday schröder threw his support behind the attempts of romania and bulgaria to join the european union , despite concerns in the rest of the bloc that it is growing too fast . " there are differing opinions about the entry of romania and bulgaria into the eu , as well as about the start of negotiations with turkey , but i remain convinced that we must support these moves , " schröder said after meeting the visiting romanian prime minister , calin tariceanu . eu hopefuls fear for schröder , europe though both countries count schröder as one of their most staunch supporters of their membership bids , a looming federal election that could replace him with a conservative alternative has struck fear . that may all be academic if current concerns over whether the dutch and french rejections of the constitution may put a freeze on enlargement become reality . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added . " of course , nobody can confidently predict the endgame of such developments . " nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .
ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

" this is a dangerous move and certainly china will oppose it , " wang told reporters at the un headquarters in new york .
" it will split the house and destroy the unity and also derail the whole process of discussion on big un reforms . " china has opposed japan being granted permanent status on the security council , demanding it first correct its attitude to its wartime history .
tensions between the two countries have risen in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they want the same thing : german chancellor schröder and japanese prime minsiter koizumi germany , japan , india and brazil have formed a group , called g4 , to lobby for permanent seats on the security council .
it has circulated a draft resolution , which could be voted on at the un general assembly in september , proposing a 25-member security council , 10 more than now , with six new permanent members . china backs alternative plan wang said china leaned toward a rival plan , proposed by italy , mexico and pakistan , to enlarge the security council to 25 members , but without additional veto-wielding permanent members . " we see many good points in their formula because this will expand the security council and this will give certain members who they believe are important a longer term , " he said . in the italy-mexico-pakistan plan , some non-permanent members could be re-elected at the end of their two-year stints on the security council , unlike the current practice . germany , japan , india and brazil plan to put their motion to the general assembly if they are certain they will get the support of two thirds of the 191 un members so that it will be passed .
the text does not say which countries should become permanent members but proposes two for asia , two for africa , one for western europe and one for latin america .
africa , latin america , asia and eastern europe would each get one of the new non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the security council : who will get in first and who will get to stay ?
according to the german-backed plan , all of the new permanent members should have the same right to veto a resolution as the current five permanent members : britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
but the united states has opposed extending the veto . preparing for a showdown ? china could not technically block a motion put to the general assembly but could kill it off later .
the change to the security council would also require changes to the un charter .
this would have to be passed by the parliaments of two thirds of the un members , including the five permanent members . altering the charter is the fourth stage in the g4 plan . " i hope it will not come to the fourth stage , " wang said . un secretary general kofi annan also said he hopes to avoid a showdown . " ideally , consensus is what one should aim for , but if that were to fail and there is a broad agreement , one should be able to vote , " he said . ghosts from the past japan has made winning a permanent seat on the security council a top goal of its foreign policy .
but china says japan has not atoned enough for the past to deserve a seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thorn in china 's side : japanese prime minister koizumi visiting yasukuni shrine in central tokyo china has strongly attacked japan recently over prime minister junichiro koizumi 's annual pilgrimage to a shrine that honors 2.5 million japanese war dead , including 14 war criminals .
china has called koizumi 's visits to the yasukuni shrine the biggest obstacle in bilateral relations . amidst angry exchanges between the two countries over the shrine , chinese vice premier wu yi last week canceled a meeting with koizumi in tokyo .
the state-run china daily on monday equated koizumi 's pilgrimage with a german chancellor visiting hitler 's bunker . koizumi has defended his visits , saying the pilgrimage is a japanese way to honor the dead .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .

more and more young people are going on hunger strikes .
at the moment , the number stands at eleven , two of them are minors . this past weekend , the director of the university 's ideology department and a police officer visited the hunger-strikers , noted down their names , and suggested they stop .
but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .

it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution . the european union 's largest member is ready to head to the negotiating table on the long-term eu budget battle . german chancellor gerhard schröder signaled that germany is ready to make a compromise on eu financing after urgent talks with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker on the fate of the european constitution .
luxembourg currently holds the eu presidency . schröder said germany is prepared to make a contribution within the confines of its material resources , but that other countries must do likewise . " all countries must move and national egos can not be allowed to get in the way , " schröder told journalists in luxembourg on thursday . countries should n't make excessive demands schröder said germany was ready to do what it could " within its means .

but he faces strong resistance . wealthier eu countries , like france and germany , balk at paying more to help out new members .
at the same time , less wealthy nations , like spain and portugal , do n't want to sacrifice some of the aid they receive . juncker , who is trying to meet with as many eu leaders as possible to sound them out on their position on the budget , is aiming to get a deal inked by heads of state when they meet at the june 16-17 summit in brussels . but the prospect of a deal is fading fast amid the growing political crisis following the rejection by dutch and french voters of the eu constitution .

but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "

" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .
injuries a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's miroslav klose was the second highest goalscorer at world cup 2002 for some players , nagging injuries present the biggest problem .
germany 's top scorer in south korea and japan three years ago , miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- from werder bremen , left the training camp this week to have his right knee operated on .
along with midfielder dietmar hamann from champions league victor liverpool and defender philip lahm , some key players will be missing from the german roster in the june tournament .
but are the hectic schedules responsible for the injuries and burnouts ?
rainer holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , said things could be better organized .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added .

ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.06.2005 euro caught in constitution crossfire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu constitution crisis drag down the single currency ?
will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added . " of course , nobody can confidently predict the endgame of such developments . " nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .

will it sink or will it float ?
the question is being leveled at the eu as a whole in the wake of the constitution rejections , but experts are beginning to ask the same thing about the euro-zone economy . the back-to-back " no " votes in france and the netherlands on the european union constitution may leave the euro zone economy deeply scarred , damaging confidence , budget and monetary policies and structural reforms , economists said thursday . the most visible blow so far was suffered by the region 's single currency .
the euro has fallen nearly two percent against the dollar since friday , a reaction to the resounding rejection of the eu charter in both countries . the greatest fear among economists and investors is national budgets getting out of control in germany , italy and france , where public deficits have already exceeded eu limits for several years . the three large european countries are also facing the domestic political point of view , the " no " vote on the treaty could paradoxically advance the structural reforms that the european economy needs , ferry said .
another impetus may come from britain , which is outside the euro zone , and takes over the rotating eu presidency in july , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferry predicts that europe is moving toward more fiscal and social competition , more restructuring and outsourcing of industries and less intervention .
in other words , the opposite of what the french " no " voters wanted . on the other hand , politicians may focus on their national priorities and give in to more populist anti-europe rhetoric , according to bank of america economist laurenzo codogno . more populist policies " would push europe even further away from the kind of supply-side reforms that are desperately needed to stimulate growth , " codogno said .
it would also put more pressure on the ecb " to rely on lower interest rates to solve problems that should more properly be addressed by means of economic reforms , " he added . the international chamber of commerce , a business organization , echoed that advice .
" the more closed a society , the more vulnerable is its economy and that is exactly what we do n't need , " said maria livanos cattaui , icc secretary general . ecb head dismisses euro fears as " absurd " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet meanwhile , the president of the european central bank , jean-claude trichet , dismissed " absurd " speculation that the euro may be abolished in the wake of the dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution . " it is totally absurd " and " complete nonsense " , trichet said at a press conference following a meeting of the ecb 's central governors . the speculation intensified on wednesday after german magazine stern claimed that the german finance ministry had blamed the euro for weak economic growth in germany , where unemployment is hovering around the five million mark , or 11.6 percent of the workforce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel that prompted the ministry and the bundesbank to throw their support behind the euro .
" german finance minister eichel and bundesbank president weber see the euro as a singular success story and an important step towards securing the future of europe , " a bundesbank spokesman insisted . concerns that ' no ' votes are the harbingers of doom although the eu 's constitution contains little in the way of economic policy , the crisis the rejections have sparked is raising new questions over europe 's already cloudy economic outlook , analysts say . " true , viewed in isolation the french and ...
dutch ' no ' votes might look like one of the occasional setbacks for the european project that are usually overcome as time goes by , " morgan stanley economist joachim fels said . " but viewed in conjunction with other political undercurrents , i think they serve to underscore that europe is on a slippery slope towards disintegration and instability - a stunning reversal of the long march towards integration and stability in the last half century , " he added .

" nationalist , rather than eu , reforms possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although the collapse of europe 's joint economic undertakings is a highly unlikely worst-case scenario , its mere mention makes policy-makers cringe with fear .
ing economist rob carnell said that the likely reaction from eu politicians eager to regain their dwindling political capital would be to seek a more " nationalist " , rather than european , approach to economic problems . that would translate into a general apathy for painful reforms and budget discipline , especially in the run up to elections in the next couple of years in big countries such as france , germany and italy . enter the age of fortress europe ? as tensions flare up with china over textiles and the united states over aircraft makers , an internal eu political crisis could also cause members to become more combative on international trade issues and seek a so-called " fortress europe " to ward off foreign competitors from steeling jobs . " i doubt we 'll see a return to quotas and tariffs but what is more likely is that you will get some more argumentative and fractious disputes , for example the dispute over airbus and boeing is likely to turn ugly , " carnell said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .

the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head .
schröder and merkel " ten years ago , germany would not have said yes to a woman , which suggests that women have greater chances today , " she said .
" but women who do get to the top have to fit in with male behavior .
merkel has learned , as a woman , how to acquire and use power , how to develop strategies and how to get her own way . "
angela merkel 's public persona is well-worn and gaining popularity , with the latest polls putting already putting her ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder . but voters will have the final say in september . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .

brazil 's ronaldo is taking a break ; germany 's top scorer at the world cup 2002 , miroslav klose , is hurt . the brazilian football confederation -lrb- cbf -rrb- and national coach carlos alberto parreira used the term " release . "
the south american and real madrid super striker ronaldo said he wanted " rest . "
whatever the case , the world cup 2002 top scorer will not be appearing at the confederations cup which kicks off in cologne , germany on june 15 .
" i needed a rest and a chance to forget about things i 've been going through , " he said on television in reference to the recent break-up with his fiancee .
" i 'm going to prepare well for next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian coach carlos alberto parreira yet in addition to the vacation from the confed cup , he will miss the next two crucial world cup qualifiers in the south america group , including a top match on wednesday against group leader argentina in buenos aires .
coach parreira -lrb- photo -rrb- had little sympathy for the striker 's personal problems .
confederations cup useless the increasingly tight league and national schedule forces players , coaches and clubs to make tough decisions about which competitions they should participate in .
the confederations cup does pit the top national teams from around the world against each other but the true meaning is missing for many .
" the confederations cup is just like the copa america , " ronaldo said .
" tournaments like this should be abolished . "
it 's a clearly understandable viewpoint for a top player like ronaldo .
to strike his name from brazil 's world cup roster would be close to blasphemy .
other players , however , are fighting for a spot on the national squads and look to take advantage of such an absence .
nevertheless , club coaches are concerned about the health of their top stars .
" it is unreasonable for international players to be on the pitch for the entire summer , " said bayern munich coach felix magath coach .
" i am puzzled how you can expect them to have a successful world cup next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- left -rrb- needs striker kevin kuranyi 's goalscoring talents in june tests national managers see it differently - including german coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he is still trying to put together the team pieces so that germany can reach his stated goal at the world cup 2006 , namely the final .
" everyone needs to give it their all if they want to be at the world cup , " he said .
injuries a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's miroslav klose was the second highest goalscorer at world cup 2002 for some players , nagging injuries present the biggest problem .
germany 's top scorer in south korea and japan three years ago , miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- from werder bremen , left the training camp this week to have his right knee operated on .
along with midfielder dietmar hamann from champions league victor liverpool and defender philip lahm , some key players will be missing from the german roster in the june tournament .
but are the hectic schedules responsible for the injuries and burnouts ?
rainer holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , said things could be better organized .
" with reasonable practice schedules and vacations place properly , it should be possible for a player to deal with the schedule , " he said but added that playing the confederations cup one year before the world cup is not reasonable . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clubs want piece of fifa pie in switzerland , a legal case between fifa and europe 's richest clubs could lead to a redistribution of power , if not wealth .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .

what happens now following the no votes to the eu constitution ?
just push on as if nothing happened , like some eu leaders are demanding ?
maybe some breathing space for the eu to take stock of itself would be better . if there were a stronger word for dead , it could be used following the dramatic clear " nee " of the dutch on wednesday .
the eu constitution is more than dead .
it is more dead than it was when the french shouted their unmistakable " non " to the treaty .
eu leaders ' persistent pleading is not going to help , either .
the crisis management by current eu president , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , eu commission president jose barroso and european parliament president josep borrell is shamefully meager .
they have little more to offer than a " keep it up ! " on the ratification - even though it was foreseeable that two of the eu 's founding nations would reject the treaty .
leaders have three options eu leaders should have come together for an immediate summit already on monday , the day after the french " non . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority in france chose the " non " over the " oui " instead , the regular eu summit in brussels in mid-june will be converted into a crisis summit .
actually , the equally important eu budget was also supposed to be on the agenda .
but that wo n't happen now .
the european heads of state have three options .
they can declare the constitution project terminated .
they can decide which parts of the constitution - for example a simplified voting procedure - can be adopted in another manner with separate treaties .
or they can hold on to the ratification process and decide at the end of 2006 how to proceed .
put treaty on the back burner the third possibility , which is the official line at the moment , is actually not an option .
if it were , the constitution text would have to be changed or at least france and the netherlands given another chance to vote on the unchanged text .
both appear politically impossible .
the second possibility - to implement certain parts - would require a consensus by the 25 member states in new treaty negotiations , which would be hard to achieve in the current situation .
it would be logically and politically rational to put the constitution project on the back burner for several years - as well-meant as it was - and bury the current draft .
leaders should stop and think the voters in france and the netherlands not only sank the treaty , they also at the same time sharply criticized a whole range of european achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands also responded with a big " nee " in their referendum the french slated the single market and economic policies .
the dutch took aim at the common currency euro , centralism and immigration policies .
this has to make european leaders stop and think .
did they move too quickly in the past 15 years , since the fall of the wall ?
did they ask too much of their citizens ?
why was n't it possible to make it clear to europeans that there was no way around the eu 's eastward expansion ?
a new europe requires a new architecture the eu was built with its back to the berlin wall .
when the wall fell , the house had to be rebuilt to stabilize it .
that 's how luxembourg 's prime minister juncker vividly explained it .
he 's right .
what 's necessary now is some breathing room .
eu leaders have to show that they are n't disregarding the will of their voters , but , on the other hand , are not going to fall into complete paralysis .
european integration has to continue , but in smaller steps .
the individual countries of the world can not survive on their own , neither politically nor economically .
it 's also time for an honest stocktaking of what is really necessary in the eu and where there is excessive integration or even paternalism .
europe does n't have to regulate everything , but rather form a framework .
this is a hercules task , which is more difficult to solve than making a constitution .
the treaty , by the way , only came about in a second attempt a year ago - also at a so-called crisis summit . bernd riegert -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany set to compromise on eu budget german chancellor gerhard schröder is ready to make concessions on the eu budget .
it is causing deep divisions between members , just as the political crisis flares up over the eu constitution .

while some fear that the " no 's " could all but bury the treaty , most eu leaders said its ratification should continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2005 german women mull woman as chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man 's woman ?
the rise of angela merkel to cdu chancellor candidate is a clear coup for her , the party and possibly germany .
as the first female aspirant , she could poker hard with her gender trump , but has thus far chosen not to . as the nation publicly ponders the more than reasonable chance of being ruled by a woman by the end of the year , the lady in question appears to dismiss the relevance of her gender out of hand .
some say that 's okay , because it 's her policies which count , but there is a strong feeling among other camps that a little more recognition of her fellow women-folk would not only boost merkel 's chances at the ballot box , but could be the making of modern germany .
although regarded from the distance of the outside world as pretty progressive , a closer look at germany reveals it to be a straggler on such issues as genuine female equality .
the sluggish birth rate , particularly among academics and women in positions of authority , is often attributed to the lack of encouragement offered to women who want the " all " of career and family . bildunterschrift : in her element days before her election there is some hope among women in high places that angela merkel will inspire a change in attitudes , but in order to achieve that she would need to make more of who she is . brunhilde raiser , the president of the national council of german women 's organizations said she finds merkel 's stance disconcerting . " the fact is that her experience is being a woman and having been minister of women 's affairs , and she should n't ignore that , " raiser said .
" i 'm not saying she has to be feminine , but she should have women on her radar . " " women need support " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rita süssmuth but rita süssmuth , a former federal minister for women and president of the german parliament , said she does n't think merkel would greatly improve her chances of being elected by touting a tough gender-political agenda . " angela merkel has realized that women need to be supported , but she has never made it central to her policies , " she said .
" the women who will vote for her do n't mind this .
she has her way of doing things and can support women through legislation .
that 's how they will judge her . "
there is an unsurprising groundswell of feeling , particularly among women , that having a female chancellor candidate is a positive step , but the jury is still out on merkel 's merits .
" germany is ready for this in the sense that the time is right , but there are of course reservations and skepticism because it 's an unknown quantity , " raiser said .
as such , merkel is under extreme scrutiny which extends far beyond the realm of her political ideals .
the lear of the limelight women in high-places have long had to deal with the critical eyes of the press and the public , and in the case of angela merkel the interest focuses on the very issue she shuns : being female .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel gets a re-touch she has taken much flak over the years for her appearance , but raiser said it is just a part of a cultural phenomenon in which women have been made to put pressure on themselves in a futile attempt to please all of the people all of the time .
yet that is not really a claim which can be laid at merkel 's door .
she has done it differently and is often accused of having fallen in with the men and out with the women during her ascent to the top of the political ladder .
that in itself is a point of critique from those women who are backing a female chancellor to inspire women to break with the binding structures of motherhood and embrace the challenge of juggling work and kids with a clear conscience .
feisty or female ?
merkel has to tread very carefully in order to prevent germany 's women from feeling snubbed whilst simultaneously remaining feisty enough to keep up with the men in the inner sanctum of the political world .
rita süssmuth said the key is being able to play different roles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head .
schröder and merkel " ten years ago , germany would not have said yes to a woman , which suggests that women have greater chances today , " she said .
" but women who do get to the top have to fit in with male behavior .
merkel has learned , as a woman , how to acquire and use power , how to develop strategies and how to get her own way . "
angela merkel 's public persona is well-worn and gaining popularity , with the latest polls putting already putting her ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder . but voters will have the final say in september . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel chosen as chancellor candidate angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- election 2005 after his social democratic party suffered defeat in state elections in north rhine-westphalia on may 22 , german chancellor gerhard schröder announced he wanted early elections to put his reform course before voters .
schröder 's election strategy hits a snag chancellor gerhard schroeder is basing new elections on losing a planned vote of " no confidence " on july 1 .
but losing that and then going on to be left 's top candidate is proving a dilemma .

the bundestag voted by 575 to seven to extend the mission of the 2,600 soldiers based in the region of prizren in the southwest of the province .
german defense minister peter struck said there was no alternative to the presence of nato forces as outbreaks of violence were still possible in the province divided between the ethnic albanian majority and minority serbs .

two opposition leaders have also just been condemned to two years of hard labor for allegedly " violating public order " when they staged a rally against lukashenko in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko such actions have earned lukashenko stinging criticism from the west for suppressing freedom of speech and freedom of the press .
but now , young people from belarus are also voicing their own strong criticism of the authoritarian regime . pressure on those parts of the population that support democratic reforms has increased in the past few months , as government leaders of the former soviet republic who have been in power for the past eleven years fear they may be losing their grip on power .
young people appear to pose the biggest threat , so more activists in democratic youth organizations are being expelled from universities and school because of their political views . now , to fight for the right for education , they ’ re using the last weapon the have : they ’ re going on hunger strikes .
pavel and arthur , two students that are no longer permitted to attend university , now gather in front of the lecture hall . " i was expelled because i attended a rally .
i was arrested and sentenced to ten days ’ imprisonment .
three days later , i was expelled from the university , " said pavel . arthur told a similar tale : " they said i would n't be allowed to take an exam and a kgb agent went to my dean and put pressure on him .

about 2,000 people between 15 and 24 years of age belong to the group that works for democracy and human rights in their country .
since the beginning of the year , 33 young people have been dismissed from the university .
not only college students are endangered , but also high school students .
if they are thrown out of school , they have no chance to finish their education , which is supposedly guaranteed by belarus ' constitution . " at first , we protested against that , but no one heeded our demands .
everything just got worse .
so we had to go on a hunger strike .

the motto of their protest is called " children want to learn " and their logo is a sun rising behind a school desk .
posters with the logo are all over city .
more and more young people are going on hunger strikes .
at the moment , the number stands at eleven , two of them are minors . this past weekend , the director of the university 's ideology department and a police officer visited the hunger-strikers , noted down their names , and suggested they stop .
but the protestors wo n't hear of it . " we 're going to keep going until all the students and pupils can continue their education , " said arthur . the young protestors are getting support from all sorts of belarus citizens .
even well-known politicians and celebrities have started a petition in support and are demanding that the belarussian government stop its repression of the students .
pavel and his fellow activists are optimistic . " we 'll succeed in ensuring a safe future for ourselves and our country .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

germany forced the pace friday as european leaders scrambled to resolve the deep political crisis over the eu constitution , with chancellor gerhard schröder scheduling a series of meetings with eu leaders . the bloc is suffering one of the biggest crises in its history after voters in france and the netherlands rejected the first text of its kind , shattering efforts to streamline ground rules for the ever-expanding eu membership . with polls in denmark suggesting it , too , would reject the treaty , britain appearing ready to put its promised referendum on ice and luxembourg 's prime minister forced to put his job on the line , schröder has emerged - almost by default - as a mediator . " i will not give up in working for this constitution , for a united europe which we need , " schröder said on thursday , after crisis talks in luxembourg with the european union 's current presidency . with french president jacques chirac compromised by the decisive " no " from his electorate in sunday 's french referendum , schröder - the other half of the franco-german engine at the heart of europe - has been forced to lead the salvage operation . he followed his flying visit to luxembourg by dashing back to berlin for a brief meeting with irish prime minister bertie ahern . chirac , blair and juncker on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac is due to fly in saturday for a working dinner in the german capital with schröder and the two will meet again five days later in paris . meanwhile schröder will squeeze in another meeting with luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker next week as well .
then british prime minister tony blair visits on june 13 , just ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on june 16-17 at which they will discuss what to do next . speculation mounted friday that britain will announce on monday that it is putting its referendum on hold in the wake of the massive rejections by voters in france and wednesday in the netherlands . struggling to keep the treaty together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while germany has ratified the constitution , albeit without a referendum , schröder and the other defenders of the constitution appeared to be facing an increasingly difficult task to hold the treaty together . he warned against " overreaction " to the referendum outcomes , but little good news was emerging on friday to help his cause . with luxembourg the next country to hold a referendum on the constitution , on july 10 , juncker declared he would resign if his country 's voters rejected it .
" it is a question of basic decency towards the voters of luxembourg , " the premier told reporters .
" if there is a ' no , ' it is not the people who have to quit .
it is up to me to go , " he added . juncker was speaking after opinion polls showed a surge of support for the " no " camp in luxembourg , the tiny state which has been a staunch supporter of the european project . denmark likely to join the no club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and in denmark , public opinion has swung against ratification of the treaty in the wake of the rejection in france and the netherlands , two opinion polls showed .
both danish polls give the " no " camp a clear lead for the first time , less than four months ahead of a referendum on september 27 . schröder meanwhile called for the process of ratifying the constitution to continue , arguing that all 25 eu member states had been promised the right to vote on it and must be allowed to do so . domestic worries lingering behind eu crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : links : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder gibt autogramme waehrend seines rundganges beim 30 .

" there are differing opinions about the entry of romania and bulgaria into the eu , as well as about the start of negotiations with turkey , but i remain convinced that we must support these moves , " schröder said after meeting the visiting romanian prime minister , calin tariceanu . eu hopefuls fear for schröder , europe though both countries count schröder as one of their most staunch supporters of their membership bids , a looming federal election that could replace him with a conservative alternative has struck fear . that may all be academic if current concerns over whether the dutch and french rejections of the constitution may put a freeze on enlargement become reality . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's motor plans emergency summit germany and france , for so long the driving force behind european integration , will hold an emergency summit this weekend to discuss the crisis unfolding after the french and dutch rejection of the eu constitution .

this was the first major research into the health of people living in the former soviet republic .
its authors , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , say the health care system in turkmenistan is poor , even by central asian standards .
over the last five years , health care has systematically deteriorated .
international bodies like the united nations and the european parliament have condemned human rights abuses in turkmenistan , but this is the first time there have been calls from leading health experts to improve medical care .
president saparmyrat niyazov has shut nearly all higher education facilities , effectively stopping the training of new doctors and nurses .
lack of prevention in addition , his other decisions have had a major impact : closing all hospitals outside the capital , abolishing free health care and firing 15,000 health care workers in just one day and replacing them with army conscripts .
" rates of tb are high , and hiv , too , " said bernd rechel from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , one of the authors of the report .
" the country is claiming there are currently no cases , but unofficial sources report there are perhaps thousands of infected people , " he added .
" and these people wo n't have access to proper diagnosis and treatment .
the policy of the government will worsen the situation , that 's for sure . "
ignoring these types of diseases means no-one knows exactly how many cases there are .
it also results in a complete lack of prevention measures - like safer sex campaigns or promoting sterile needle use .
the report states the government is ignoring the increasing number of young people taking hard drugs , which is fuelling suicide rates and prostitution .
the international community must act now , the scientists say , to make the government improve health care access and stop human rights violations that are increasing public health problems .

this was the first major research into the health of people living in the former soviet republic .
its authors , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , say the health care system in turkmenistan is poor , even by central asian standards .
over the last five years , health care has systematically deteriorated .
international bodies like the united nations and the european parliament have condemned human rights abuses in turkmenistan , but this is the first time there have been calls from leading health experts to improve medical care .
president saparmyrat niyazov has shut nearly all higher education facilities , effectively stopping the training of new doctors and nurses .
lack of prevention in addition , his other decisions have had a major impact : closing all hospitals outside the capital , abolishing free health care and firing 15,000 health care workers in just one day and replacing them with army conscripts .
" rates of tb are high , and hiv , too , " said bernd rechel from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine , one of the authors of the report .
" the country is claiming there are currently no cases , but unofficial sources report there are perhaps thousands of infected people , " he added .
" and these people wo n't have access to proper diagnosis and treatment .
the policy of the government will worsen the situation , that 's for sure . "
ignoring these types of diseases means no-one knows exactly how many cases there are .
it also results in a complete lack of prevention measures - like safer sex campaigns or promoting sterile needle use .

laura rhodes , 13 , from neath , south wales , committed suicide last year .
her parents believe she was unhappy at bullying about her weight and sexuality at cefn saeson school .
an inquest ruled the school did all it could to help laura .
the school and the local authority said that they were satisfied with the coroner 's findings .
laura died last september after taking an overdose of painkillers with a 14-year-old friend from birmingham .
her friend - who can not be named for legal reasons - survived .
the inquest into laura 's death heard that the two girls had met over the internet and formed a close relationship , going on holiday together to crete with laura 's family .
mike rhodes says they can try to prevent this happening to another child but on their return to the uk , ran away together to bath .
neath port talbot coroner david osborne said that the situation at the school had not been the main cause of the suicide pact between the girls .
the inquest heard that laura had suffered name-calling about her weight and sexuality during her time at cefn saeson , from september 2002 to july 2003 .
she left the school a year before taking her own life .
the inquest concluded that , whilst bullying at the school had made her unhappy , it was not to blame for her death .
the inquest heard cefn saeson had done all it could to help laura , bringing in experts to help .
but laura 's parents mike and yvonne rhodes still believe the bullying was a factor and said they were taking legal action in a stand against bullying .
laura attended cefn saeson school for one academic year " we want to prevent it happening to any other children - that 's the main thing now , " mr rhodes told bbc wales .
" it 's too late for laura .
we ca n't have true justice , can we ?
we ca n't have laura back .
but maybe we can prevent it happening to some other child . "
in a joint statement the local education authority and the school said laura 's death was a " tragedy " and offered their sympathies to her family .
the statement said : " the appropriate place for the circumstances surrounding laura 's unfortunate death to be decided upon was at the coroner 's inquest , where all the necessary evidence and documents were presented .
" the coroner , therefore , was in the best position to reach a decision .
" we are satisfied by the coroner 's findings that name-calling was not the cause of laura 's death . "

laura rhodes , 13 , from neath , south wales , committed suicide last year .
her parents believe she was unhappy at bullying about her weight and sexuality at cefn saeson school .
an inquest ruled the school did all it could to help laura .
the school and the local authority said that they were satisfied with the coroner 's findings .
laura died last september after taking an overdose of painkillers with a 14-year-old friend from birmingham .
her friend - who can not be named for legal reasons - survived .
the inquest into laura 's death heard that the two girls had met over the internet and formed a close relationship , going on holiday together to crete with laura 's family .
but on their return to the uk , ran away together to bath .
neath port talbot coroner david osborne said that the situation at the school had not been the main cause of the suicide pact between the girls .
the inquest heard that laura had suffered name-calling about her weight and sexuality during her time at cefn saeson , from september 2002 to july 2003 .
she left the school a year before taking her own life .
the inquest concluded that , whilst bullying at the school had made her unhappy , it was not to blame for her death .
the inquest heard cefn saeson had done all it could to help laura , bringing in experts to help .
but laura 's parents mike and yvonne rhodes still believe the bullying was a factor and said they were taking legal action in a stand against bullying .
" we want to prevent it happening to any other children - that 's the main thing now , " mr rhodes told bbc wales .
" it 's too late for laura .
we ca n't have true justice , can we ?
we ca n't have laura back .
but maybe we can prevent it happening to some other child . "
in a joint statement the local education authority and the school said laura 's death was a " tragedy " and offered their sympathies to her family .
the statement said : " the appropriate place for the circumstances surrounding laura 's unfortunate death to be decided upon was at the coroner 's inquest , where all the necessary evidence and documents were presented .
" the coroner , therefore , was in the best position to reach a decision .
" we are satisfied by the coroner 's findings that name-calling was not the cause of laura 's death . "

the messages , which can be sent from any part of northern ireland , will go centrally to the police service 's belfast regional control centre .
sign language staff at the centre will then direct the call to one , or all , of the required emergency services - police , ambulance and fire and rescue .
in addition to the scheme , the police are also training disability link officers in each of its 29 district command units .
the officers will be trained in both english and irish sign language .
hugh orde said the new text service was another step towards making northern ireland a safer place for everyone .
" it also allows a group of people in the deaf and signing community who may in the past have found it difficult to communicate with the police and other emergency services and to deal with us in confidence , " he said .
" policing with the community is all about partnership . "
majella mcateer , of the deaf association of northern ireland said : " we are delighted with this recent development as it is vital that deaf sign language users have equal access to the emergency services of northern ireland .
" we hope that we can continue to break down barriers , raise awareness within the community and improve access to services for deaf sign language users . "

this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
i agree with mr damaged that the percentages mentioned are far from giving a realistic picture of the abuse of this drug amongst gay men as a whole .
tina is a growing problem true , but ghb is widespread and far more dangerous .
however , it must be said that tina is addictive and people should be aware that this kind of drug can ruin their lives .
do n't be a victim to crystal meth !
it 's ugly man !
mike , london can we note that this is unpublished research and based on people they 've met in gay gyms - far from representative if not distorting .
crystal is horrendous but we 're far from where this report suggests - the real crisis is ghb .
mr damaged , london , uk methamphetamine manufacture requires some very specific chemicals and a very dangerous production process .
if it is , as i suspect , being manufactured in the uk then the chemical companies could be recruited to watch over various chemicals needed to produce the drug .
i appreciate that manufacturers would shop around buying different components from different suppliers , but if one chemical was controlled , it would be possible to curb the drugs production .

i agree with mr damaged that the percentages mentioned are far from giving a realistic picture of the abuse of this drug amongst gay men as a whole .
tina is a growing problem true , but ghb is widespread and far more dangerous .
however , it must be said that tina is addictive and people should be aware that this kind of drug can ruin their lives .

it 's ugly man !
mike , london can we note that this is unpublished research and based on people they 've met in gay gyms - far from representative if not distorting .
crystal is horrendous but we 're far from where this report suggests - the real crisis is ghb .
mr damaged , london , uk methamphetamine manufacture requires some very specific chemicals and a very dangerous production process .
if it is , as i suspect , being manufactured in the uk then the chemical companies could be recruited to watch over various chemicals needed to produce the drug .
i appreciate that manufacturers would shop around buying different components from different suppliers , but if one chemical was controlled , it would be possible to curb the drugs production .

i agree with mr damaged that the percentages mentioned are far from giving a realistic picture of the abuse of this drug amongst gay men as a whole .
tina is a growing problem true , but ghb is widespread and far more dangerous .
however , it must be said that tina is addictive and people should be aware that this kind of drug can ruin their lives .
do n't be a victim to crystal meth !
it 's ugly man !
mike , london can we note that this is unpublished research and based on people they 've met in gay gyms - far from representative if not distorting .
crystal is horrendous but we 're far from where this report suggests - the real crisis is ghb .
mr damaged , london , uk methamphetamine manufacture requires some very specific chemicals and a very dangerous production process .
if it is , as i suspect , being manufactured in the uk then the chemical companies could be recruited to watch over various chemicals needed to produce the drug .
i appreciate that manufacturers would shop around buying different components from different suppliers , but if one chemical was controlled , it would be possible to curb the drugs production .

staff at maesteg comprehensive near bridgend say they will confiscate the ' hoodies ' from any pupil found wearing one when children return to school .
letters were sent to parents last week informing them of the new ruling .
the children 's charity nch has said most youngsters are " mystified " by the opposition to the tops .
the move at maesteg comprehensive school follows a series of high-profile bans across the uk , triggered by a decision not to allow them at the bluewater shopping complex in kent . "
all hooded tops will be confiscated and only returned at the end of each half-term " head teacher anne carhart last month , the centre issued a code of conduct which also banned swearing , anti-social behaviour and caps .
tony blair expressed support and the shopping centre said visitor numbers increased after the ban was introduced .
in a newsletter sent to parents , maesteg head teacher anne carhart thanked parents for their support in a recent " clampdown " on uniforms .
but she added : " we are particularly concerned as hooded tops are reappearing and the hood is being used to hide pupils ' identity during unacceptable behaviour .
" all hooded tops will be confiscated and only returned at the end of each half-term . "
but nch youth worker leah savory said youngsters she meets do not understand why adults connect certain fashion items with intimidation and criminality .
for the vast majority of youngsters , wearing a hood is much more about wearing clothes that are young and fashionable than it is about looking deliberately intimidating and threatening , she said .
but ms savory said it was definitely not acceptable for individual young people or groups to intimidate threaten or abuse others , in a shopping centre , on the streets or anywhere else .
but she added adults can not " have it both ways " .
" if this is what we think as a society we should say so , and the police , neighbourhood wardens and others should enforce these rules - clearly , fairly and transparently .
" on the one hand , we have educationalists and psychologists saying it is good for young people to express themselves and to be encouraged to tolerate difference .
" on the other hand , adults are actually banning the clothes they choose to wear .
as well as the bluewater outlawing of ' hoodies ' , a violent teenager from manchester was also recently given an asbo which included a five-year-ban on wearing a hooded top .
