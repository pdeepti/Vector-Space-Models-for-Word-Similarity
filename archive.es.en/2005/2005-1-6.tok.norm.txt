debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .

while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .

pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .

after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .
if the international community can coordinate humanitarian aid , debt relief and financial help for a catastrophe of such an immense scale , perhaps new standards can be set for the future . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waves of horror dw-world 's complete coverage of the asian tsunami disaster .

although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .

the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

in late december , the state interior ministers agreed that the new regulations - which could require the immigrants to speak german and to have the skills to get a job in germany - would apply to all but the 27,000 people who had by the end of 2004 received written permission to move , according to the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
the new rules have neither been finalized nor have they been made public yet .
the paper reported that the changes will also be valid for those who have applied but not yet gotten approval to move .
since 1990 , people from the former soviet union have only had to show a birth certificate proving their jewish heritage to be allowed to live in germany . dw-world.de acrimony over jewish immigration interior minister otto schily and german jewish leader paul spiegel are at odds over changes to rules permitting jews from the former soviet union to immigrate to germany .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .

while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .

the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .

after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .

aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .
6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .
11 . "
pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .
china and japan pledge cooperation japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and chinese premier wen jiabao met on the sidelines of the summit , both interested in seeing their play prominent roles in the relief effort .
the two countries have seen their relations sharply deteriorate in recent months , but their leaders pledged in jakarta to work together to help victims of asia 's tsunami disaster .
" i would like to strengthen the cooperative relationship between japan and china in the field of disaster assistance , " wen told koizumi , as quoted by a japanese foreign ministry official .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .
if the international community can coordinate humanitarian aid , debt relief and financial help for a catastrophe of such an immense scale , perhaps new standards can be set for the future . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waves of horror dw-world 's complete coverage of the asian tsunami disaster .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .

the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

in late december , the state interior ministers agreed that the new regulations - which could require the immigrants to speak german and to have the skills to get a job in germany - would apply to all but the 27,000 people who had by the end of 2004 received written permission to move , according to the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
the new rules have neither been finalized nor have they been made public yet .
the paper reported that the changes will also be valid for those who have applied but not yet gotten approval to move .
since 1990 , people from the former soviet union have only had to show a birth certificate proving their jewish heritage to be allowed to live in germany . dw-world.de acrimony over jewish immigration interior minister otto schily and german jewish leader paul spiegel are at odds over changes to rules permitting jews from the former soviet union to immigrate to germany .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .
if the international community can coordinate humanitarian aid , debt relief and financial help for a catastrophe of such an immense scale , perhaps new standards can be set for the future . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waves of horror dw-world 's complete coverage of the asian tsunami disaster .
germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany one of the single largest donors so far .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .
6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .
11 . "
pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .
china and japan pledge cooperation japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and chinese premier wen jiabao met on the sidelines of the summit , both interested in seeing their play prominent roles in the relief effort .
the two countries have seen their relations sharply deteriorate in recent months , but their leaders pledged in jakarta to work together to help victims of asia 's tsunami disaster .
" i would like to strengthen the cooperative relationship between japan and china in the field of disaster assistance , " wen told koizumi , as quoted by a japanese foreign ministry official .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .

the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2005 opinion : aiding with more than pledges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid often does n't make it to those that need it germany 's decision to raise its aid for the asian tsunami to € 500 million should increase pressure on the united states and other industrial nations to follow suit at a donor conference in jakarta starting thursday . the natural catastrophe caused by last month 's underwater earthquake and ensuing tsunami is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions .
the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .

after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2005 opinion : aiding with more than pledges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid often does n't make it to those that need it germany 's decision to raise its aid for the asian tsunami to € 500 million should increase pressure on the united states and other industrial nations to follow suit at a donor conference in jakarta starting thursday . the natural catastrophe caused by last month 's underwater earthquake and ensuing tsunami is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions .
the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .

the new rules have neither been finalized nor have they been made public yet .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros .

aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .

while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .

un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "

hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .

bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2005 smarter soccer through chips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon the ball will be smarter than the players controversial calls in soccer about whether a player was offsides or a ball really made it behind the goal line could be a thing of the past thanks to a new technology developed in germany . the scientists at the fraunhofer institute for integrated circuits looked somewhat out of place on the practice field next to their erlangen facility kicking a soccer ball around .
but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .

the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2005 smarter soccer through chips großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon the ball will be smarter than the players controversial calls in soccer about whether a player was offsides or a ball really made it behind the goal line could be a thing of the past thanks to a new technology developed in germany . the scientists at the fraunhofer institute for integrated circuits looked somewhat out of place on the practice field next to their erlangen facility kicking a soccer ball around .
but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .

after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .
if the international community can coordinate humanitarian aid , debt relief and financial help for a catastrophe of such an immense scale , perhaps new standards can be set for the future . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waves of horror dw-world 's complete coverage of the asian tsunami disaster .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2005 opinion : aiding with more than pledges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid often does n't make it to those that need it germany 's decision to raise its aid for the asian tsunami to € 500 million should increase pressure on the united states and other industrial nations to follow suit at a donor conference in jakarta starting thursday . the natural catastrophe caused by last month 's underwater earthquake and ensuing tsunami is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions .
the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .
6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .

pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .

although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .

that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .
6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "

6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .

pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .

compared to the previous year , the two car companies have edged closer to their us and japanese competition . while us automakers mostly spun their wheels in 2004 with lacklustre sales as competition from foreign manufacturers accelerated , two of germany ’ s big car manufacturers closed the year in high gear .
although overall sales for german cars on the tough us market were down slightly from the previous year , bmw and daimlerchrysler reported two-digit growth in sold units during december – a sign that americans started to look beyond japan for their car imports . end of year pick up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new m6 will be powered by a 5.0-liter v10 engine and will be able to go from 0-62mph in 4.6 seconds .
it hits the market in 2005 .
in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .

the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .
the end of the year boost helped the munich-based automaker increase its annual us sales by 7 percent to 296,111 vehicles and pushed it ahead of its biggest german competitor volkswagen . daimlerchrysler said tuesday its us sales were up more than 3 percent in 2004 for 2,427,634 cars sold .
the increase was largely helped by a surprise 11 percent jump in year-end sales .
the german-us company is the only one of the american “ big three ” which ended the year on a positive note .
for the company ’ s luxury mercedes-benz line , sales rose 23 percent in december to 26,607 – the best month ever for the nameplate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's 2003 model of the 911 turbo cabriolet will get a new look in 2004 .
the german sports carmaker porsche lost speed as the year closed out and had to book a 7.2 percent loss in us sales .
the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .
audi of america also watched as 9.8 percent fewer cars were sold in the us . a december surprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german car brands like mercedes , bmw , porsche and volkswagen pulled ahead towards the end of 2004 “ the strong sales figures for foreign carmakers in december were the surprise of the month , ” joseph barker of csm worldwide told reuters .
the car market analyst said the us market , which is already saturated , will continue to show strong outside competition in the coming year .
new brands and models will continue to put more pressure on the existing players . the key ones to watch are the japanese .
nissan , honda and the hugely popular toyota showed large two-digit growth for december while the world ’ s largest automaker gm suffered losses of more than 6 percent .
ford , the second biggest us car company , also reported for the seventh consecutive month a decline in sales . resarch firm autodata corp. said the december auto figures translate to an annualized sales rate of 18.4 million units versus 17.47 million a year ago .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .

shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .

washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations secretary-general kofi annan addresses a press conference at the tsunami summit in jakarta , indonesia , thursday , jan .
6 , 2005 .
while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "
he said un secretary general kofi annan " can count on our full support .
we look forward to participating in the un donors conference in geneva on jan .
11 . "
pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

the us secretary of state told the conference that some $ 200 million in private donations had been raised in the united states and stressed the massive relief operation mounted by its military .
he said more than 14,000 military personnel were dispatched to the region , along with a carrier group , an amphibious group , helicopters , supply and patrol planes and ships able to supply tens of thousands of gallons of fresh water .
china and japan pledge cooperation japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and chinese premier wen jiabao met on the sidelines of the summit , both interested in seeing their play prominent roles in the relief effort .
the two countries have seen their relations sharply deteriorate in recent months , but their leaders pledged in jakarta to work together to help victims of asia 's tsunami disaster .
" i would like to strengthen the cooperative relationship between japan and china in the field of disaster assistance , " wen told koizumi , as quoted by a japanese foreign ministry official .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

debt repayment for affected countries will also be delayed . close to € 3 billion -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in aid has been pledged by individuals and governments , but the one-day emergency conference was called to address longer-term aid efforts and to make sure help gets to the five million people who need it - the survivors of the indian ocean tsunami disaster .
aid organizations are concerned that the various donors might fail to deliver on pledges once media attention turns elsewhere .
bringing together leaders from 26 countries and organizations , the summit tackled debt relief for the hardest-hit nations , as rich countries agreed to allow interest and repayment to be postponed to aid reconstruction efforts .
those attending also agreed to set up an early warning system for the indian ocean and developing structures to improve coordination of the relief effort .
unprecedented response the emergency summit for the 11 stricken countries opened with a minute 's silence .
the first person to address the gathering was the conference host , indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
" we do not yet have a name for the quake and tsunami that hit our regions on the 26th of december , 2004 , " he said .
" but we know that it 's the most destructive natural disaster in living memory . "

while world health organization experts warned that the death toll in the countries hit by the tsunami could double unless swift action is taken to prevent the spread of disease , un secretary-general kofi annan said some € 750 million -lrb- $ 979 million -rrb- would be needed in the next six months to meet the emergency requirements of 5 million people .
" what happened on dec .
26 was an unprecedented , global catastrophe , " he said .
" it requires an unprecedented , global response . "
un relief coordinator jan egeland said the un was expecting to care for up to 800,000 tsunami survivors in indonesia alone for the next year .
officials also warned that orphaned children could easily end up kidnapped by traffickers .
one-upmanship ?
speaking to the press later , annan dismissed notions of a rivalry between rich nations to be the most generous donor .
" i am encouraged and i think it is not a beauty contest , " he said .
" i think all the leaders here are genuinely concerned and would like to make every contribution they can . "
no more core group us secretary of state colin powell announced at the conference that his country was dissolving the " core group " of nations it formed with india , japan and australia to expedite aid for victims of the asian tsunami disaster .
" the core group helped to catalyze the international response , " he said .
" now having served its purpose , it will now fold itself into the broader coordination efforts of the united nations . "
some saw the four-nation group , later joined by canada and the netherlands , as overlapping or competing with the united nations , which traditionally has taken the lead in coordinating international responses to disasters .
" we recognize that the governments of the affected nations have the primary role in rebuilding their countries , " powell said .
" but in the face of a disaster of this immensity , international help and cooperation is crucial .
the united states welcomes the coordinating role of the united nations . "

pressing for un leadership leaders of the countries worst affected by the catastrophe , including indonesia , sri lanka and thailand , pressed at the jakarta conference for un leadership of the reconstruction drive .
hatsuhisa takashima , spokesman for japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura , said that in the face of such pressure , " the role of the so-called core group is expected to be transferred to the united nations . "
speculation mounted before the conference over whether the us would raise its aid commitment after moves by australia and germany to boost theirs .
" in all likelihood our contribution will be revised upward as the full effects of this massive tragedy can be better assessed , " powell told the afflicted nations .
" president bush wants you to know that you will have the full support of the united states as you go through the process of relief , recovery , and reconstruction . "

in december , bmw reported an 18 percent increase in sales for a total of 29,292 cars sold in the united states .

the company justified the decline as an example of consumer hold-out : porsche is expected to introduce its new “ boxster ” to the us in january .
but thanks largely to the success of its all-terrain “ cayenne , ” the porsche company was able to maintain a positive year-long increase of 10.4 percent . volkswagen , which also saw a massive 19 percent increase in december sales , didn ’ t have enough strength to pull ahead at the end of the year and reported a 15 percent overall decline in sales compared to 2003 .

a controversial proposal to digitalize germany 's cultural heritage with the help of the country 's new one-euro job scheme is ruffling feathers at the german cultural council . bill gates got there first in the early 1990s , when his corbis agency began securing digital rights to license images , including masterpieces such as " mona lisa , " " whistler 's mother " and various library and archive collections .
now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

now , another entrepreneur has followed suit and suggested going online with germany 's entire cultural archives , pooled from some 12,000 libraries , literary , art and photography collections , state museums and theaters .
it 's a daunting task .
but what makes the idea so contentious is that his first priority is not so much preserving german culture for posterity as providing 20,000 unemployed germans with so-called " one-euro jobs " that were introduced as part of a social welfare reform .
jeopardizing the job market ?
hans j. heinrich , publisher and museums expert , thinks he 's hit on a win-win situation .
he foresees a team recruited from the ranks of germany 's long-term unemployed academics for an initial two years , tasked with digitalizing some 100 million german cultural treasures .
but the german cultural council is having none of it .
its main concerns are that the project will breach copyright law ; be implemented by people lacking appropriate qualifications and experience of handling cultural property - and inevitably damage the already fragile job market for arts and culture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss however , christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's state secretary for media and culture , thinks heinrich might just be on to something .
the cultural council has called on her to reconsider her approval .
" creating 20,000 one-euro jobs for a cultural project will affect the entire job market to an extent we ca n't predict , " said its manager , olaf zimmermann .
" no one in the cultural sector will continue to hire staff if it 's possible to find workers for next to nothing .
with one-euro jobs , the state takes over the employee 's costs , which would add up to € 72 million for a two-year project .
it 's unacceptable that such a vast undertaking can be waved past the standard structures , committees and hierarchies by -lrb- christina weiss -rrb- . "
multiple benefits supporters of the project point out that for once , the one-euro scheme could be constructive .
often dismissed simply as a way of fudging unemployment figures , implemented along the lines described by heinrich , it genuinely could help the jobless develop new skills .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for help at a german unemployment office with some 50,000 unemployed in the cultural sector , heinrich is convinced the scheme will attract plenty of applicants , who would then undergo a month-long training in digital technology and data processing .
he 's also been at pains to point out that the project would prove profitable for the museums and archives by increasing their commercial scope by facilitating image reproduction , for example , and serving as a potentially lucrative research service .
moreover , by providing electronic back-up , a centralized database would help limit damage on the scale suffered by the anna amalia library last year , allowing works of art to be precisely reconstructed with reference to the original . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de one euro , one way out of unemployment ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.01.2005 opinion : aiding with more than pledges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid often does n't make it to those that need it germany 's decision to raise its aid for the asian tsunami to € 500 million should increase pressure on the united states and other industrial nations to follow suit at a donor conference in jakarta starting thursday . the natural catastrophe caused by last month 's underwater earthquake and ensuing tsunami is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions .
the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .

the scope of the disaster makes it extremely difficult to coordinate relief efforts , but world leaders have gathered in the indonesian capital jakarta for a one-day summit . in the wake of the destruction across south asia , the outpouring of sympathy and willingness to give has been impressive the world over .
however , considerable vigilance will be required to ensure sums agreed to on paper eventually make it to those who need it most . on wednesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said berlin was increasing its pledge to half a billion euros .
calculating the amount of financial aid the world 's rich nations should contribute to such a tragedy is always tricky , however , germany 's offer is an encouraging sign .
shortly thereafter , australia said it would donate aus $ 1 billion -lrb- € 578 million -rrb- in aid .
both pledges easily top washington 's pledge of $ 350 million , highlighting just how stingy the united states - the world 's wealthiest nation - is being with its financial aid . of course , no one is arguing rich nations should get into a race to trump each other with ever increasing aid amounts simply for pr reasons .
but with an estimated death toll already estimated at over 200,000 and millions of others injured or displaced , the asian tsunami is a disaster without modern precedent .
it demands a commensurate response both physically and financially . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american crewmen from the uss abraham lincoln and indonesian army soldiers load relief supplies onto a u.s. navy sea hawk helicopter at banda aceh airport for a sortie to earthquake and tsunami victims monday jan .
3 , 2005 .
after appearing to be slow to react in the immediate wake of the catastrophe , the united states has now ramped up its relief operations across south asia considerably .
following his tour of one of the hardest hit areas in indonesia , us secretary of state colin powell said washington would likely double the number of helicopters currently being used to ferry supplies and the injured .
the us armed forces have also deployed a fleet of naval ships and military aircraft .
that increased logistical aid is crucial , since the united states is one of the few nations that can organize such help . increasing us aid but us president george w. bush would now do well to double his financial commitment to all the affected countries .
washington 's pledge of $ 350 million is a vast improvement over the embarrassing $ 15 million initially offered , but it is dwarfed by the billions america pledged to help relief efforts for far less devastating hurricanes in florida last year . compared to the pledges of germany and australia , washington 's financial aid does n't measure up to the relative size of the united states ' economy .
japan , the world 's second largest economy , has already offered $ 500 million and even tiny norway is donating $ 180 million . washington 's leadership is also needed to ensure money that is pledged at the donor conference eventually shows up .
too often the world has pledged money after a natural or man-made catastrophe that never makes it to those in need .
whether for the rebuilding of afghanistan after the toppling of the taliban or for reconstruction aid follow the devastating earthquake in bam , iran in 2003 , follow through on pledges is shockingly poor . of course , to encourage donor nations to deliver the actual sums they pledge , the entire nature of such relief efforts must become more transparent and efficient .
greater international coordination is required to track where money is coming from and for what purpose it is eventually used . the dramatic and enormous nature of the tsunami disaster is what makes the summit in jakarta so important .
if the international community can coordinate humanitarian aid , debt relief and financial help for a catastrophe of such an immense scale , perhaps new standards can be set for the future . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waves of horror dw-world 's complete coverage of the asian tsunami disaster .

in late december , the state interior ministers agreed that the new regulations - which could require the immigrants to speak german and to have the skills to get a job in germany - would apply to all but the 27,000 people who had by the end of 2004 received written permission to move , according to the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
the new rules have neither been finalized nor have they been made public yet .
the paper reported that the changes will also be valid for those who have applied but not yet gotten approval to move .

in late december , the state interior ministers agreed that the new regulations - which could require the immigrants to speak german and to have the skills to get a job in germany - would apply to all but the 27,000 people who had by the end of 2004 received written permission to move , according to the süddeutsche zeitung daily .
the new rules have neither been finalized nor have they been made public yet .
the paper reported that the changes will also be valid for those who have applied but not yet gotten approval to move .
since 1990 , people from the former soviet union have only had to show a birth certificate proving their jewish heritage to be allowed to live in germany . dw-world.de acrimony over jewish immigration interior minister otto schily and german jewish leader paul spiegel are at odds over changes to rules permitting jews from the former soviet union to immigrate to germany .

euronext chief jean-francois theodore was scheduled to meet furse on friday .
the financial times said the fact that both cash equities and derivatives would be run out of london , leaving only clearing , settlement , information technology and central functions in frankfurt , would risk upsetting elements of corporate germany and politicians were concerned that seifert was making too many concessions . dw-world.de deutsche börse launches charm offensive in its bid to win over the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , german stock market operator deutsche börse appeared to be pulling out all the stops on wednesday to convince its london rival of the virtues of a merger .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .

aid groups are working in earnest in the tsunami-hit regions thanks to generous donations .
but some are so overwhelmed by the flood of funds , they want people to stop donating exclusively for south asia . aid organization medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- has flown around 250 tons of relief supplies so far to the asian countries hit by the tsunami .
its volunteers in europe have loaded everything from medicines , generators , mosquito nets and plastic sheets on to charter planes bound for the crisis regions . most of the supplies were bought by the funds and charitable donations that have been pouring into the organization 's bank account ever since the disaster struck on dec .
26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point .

26 , 2004 . the german chapter of msf says it has collected over € 30 million -lrb- $ 39.5 million -rrb- in germany alone . no more money needed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami survivors from the aceh islands queue for food at a refugee center on the outskirts of banda aceh .
but , more than 10 days after the powerful undersea quake in the indian ocean devastated the coastlines of several south asian countries , msf has asked people to stop donating for the tsunami-hit regions . surprising as it sounds , the organization says that all the large emergency medical aid programs in the affected regions are completely financed at the moment and further money is n't needed at this point . " we 've already raked in more than our entire income in the past year , " said ulrike von pilar , head of the german branch of msf .
" we have to remind people that we 're just an emergency-medicine organization .
the money that 's flowing in has to be sensibly invested in programs that really guarantee medical quality in the long term .
that 's not what we 're about . " donate , but not just for south asia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsunami victims stand by temporary residences after losing their homes in a camp at the eastern coastal village of kattankudi , near batticaloa , sri lanka .
that 's why msf is now urging people to transfer money to them without explicitly mentioning " seaquake " on the transactions because that would only allow it to use the donations for the tsunami-affected regions in asia . " we ca n't exactly guarantee that we can use the funds there in the next few months , " said von pilar .
" so , if donors really want to contribute towards reconstruction in the disaster zones , it 's better if they give to other organizations who plan to work there in the long term . " at the same time von pilar stressed that msf still welcomed donations that were n't earmarked for a certain region .
" we could always use the money where it 's needed most urgently , " she said .
" that could be in asia at the moment or in other large crisis regions where we work , in darfur or in congo , for instance . " " logistical nightmare " msf is a veteran as far as managing humanitarian crisis goes .
the private emergency-medicine organization has been around since the early 1970s and has grown into an international network with offices in 18 countries . but , despite its experience in the field , the aid group admits that the deployment in south asia in the wake of the devastating tsunami has been quite a challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman and a dog walk across a submerged debris-filled street in banda aceh , indonesia .
" transporting relief supplies to the worst-affected regions has been a logistical nightmare , " said petra meyer , spokeswoman for msf 's german branch .
" things are particularly bad in the indonesian province of banda aceh where there 's hardly any fuel , the helicopters ca n't land because most streets have been washed away , and the airport naturally is overburdened so that heavy cargo planes ca n't touch down there at all . " msf has several hundred international and local colleagues in even the most inaccessible tsunami-hit regions .
however , the group is uncertain how long it will take before the basic medical needs of the civilian population are met . " at the moment , we ca n't say how long we 'll stay on in the region with our emergency medicine program , " said meyer .
" definitely weeks , maybe even months . " christiane wolters -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping aceh connect again aceh faces a lack of aid , but also information .

but although they might be stiff-legged and pale from all that time sitting in front of computer screens , the decidedly unsporty researchers could be changing the way world soccer is refereed . they have developed a new , wireless ball and player location system that can immediately tell referees and game analysts where the soccer ball or striker is at any point in time - to the centimeter . the fraunhofer scientists got the initial assist from cairos technologies in karlsbad .
the company 's director , hartmut braun , got the idea with a friend after watching a game .
he knew that after a soccer game , fans around the world gather at their local bars or in homes debating whether the ball was actually in the goal or some player was really offsides when he made that winning kick . microchips there has been talk about installing photoelectric sensors around the field or even radar .
but cairos decided to ask the fraunhofer institute to plant electronic bugs of a sort in the balls and the players ' shinpads which enable sensors to pinpoint their exact position on the field at any time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for five years , the chip-wearing scientists in erlangen kicked a chip-ball around , measuring , programming and playing test matches on the roof of their building and on the small field next door . the chips read the current position of the ball and the 22 players on the field up to 2000 times a second , according to the institute 's rené dunkler .
the data is then pick up by antennas that are placed around the field and sent on to a central computer , which processes the statistical information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could , for example , tell spectators in a fraction of a second that the ball accelerated from 21 to 137 kph after the most recent kick or that it missed the right goalpost by 3.9 centimeters .
coaches could also tell which players were hustling around the pitch , and which were holding back , either out of fatigue or laziness . put to the test joseph blatter , head of the soccer governing body fifa , has given signs that he is receptive to the new technology .
german ball manufacturer adidas is to make a presentation to fifa on feb .
26 , when a chip-laden ball will be used at a test match .
if the trial is successful , the ball will be used in the carling cup final in cardiff on feb .
27 . referees have also shown interest in the new technology .
it could potentially help them in the many high-stress situations they find themselves in , when the calls they must make in mere moments seal the fates of careers , titles and millions of euros . " we 're seeing speed and accuracy in soccer developing at a rapid rate , and the job becoming more demanding , " fifa referee urs meier told the news magazine der spiegel .
" if the technology is there , it should be used . " other sports , other uses although the technology was initially developed for soccer , other sports could just as well benefit from the new chips , such as ski jumping , football , basketball or baseball . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bookies could hit it big with new betting options the technology creates .
bookies could find use for the development , as the statistics generated could open up new vistas for gamblers . besides sports , tests using the chips in airports are underway and were featured at a recent trade fair on security .
developers say the system could also be used in searching for missing persons , guarding prisoners or maintaining security around buildings . a revolution that is beginning with a little black-and-white ball looks like it could spread much further . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the ugly side of the beautiful game an explosion of racial abuse in european soccer over the past few weeks has seen the return of a problem once thought of as a relic of the game .

picture : north news the organic food industry has been given a boost after potatoes which can be grown without chemicals but resist deadly diseases have been identified .
a european study , led by researchers at newcastle university , found up to 10 varieties which are resilient to the deadly fungal disease blight .
they also created ' designer composts ' to increase organic potato crop yields .
the findings are being presented at a meeting on thursday hosted by the soil association and newcastle university .
several varieties of organic potato are on supermarket shelves across the continent for the first time , thanks to the study .
prof carlo leifert , behind the project , said : " until now it 's been hard to find varieties of potato that can be grown organically but can resist blight , and it 's taken a lot of investigation to get this far .
" from a european perspective , you ca n't really find a ' one size fits all ' solution to the organic problem - a potato that 's popular with the swiss may not suit what the british consumer wants for baked potato , mash and chips . "
among the newly-available organic potato selection are two scottish varieties , eve balfour and lady balfour , and a " purple " potato from hungary .

picture : north news the organic food industry has been given a boost after potatoes which can be grown without chemicals but resist deadly diseases have been identified .
a european study , led by researchers at newcastle university , found up to 10 varieties which are resilient to the deadly fungal disease blight .
they also created ' designer composts ' to increase organic potato crop yields .
the findings are being presented at a meeting on thursday hosted by the soil association and newcastle university .
several varieties of organic potato are on supermarket shelves across the continent for the first time , thanks to the study .
prof carlo leifert , behind the project , said : " until now it 's been hard to find varieties of potato that can be grown organically but can resist blight , and it 's taken a lot of investigation to get this far .
" from a european perspective , you ca n't really find a ' one size fits all ' solution to the organic problem - a potato that 's popular with the swiss may not suit what the british consumer wants for baked potato , mash and chips . "
among the newly-available organic potato selection are two scottish varieties , eve balfour and lady balfour , and a " purple " potato from hungary .

parts of the island convey the false impression of normality at first glance , the main tourist strip in patong , the island 's largest resort , seems the same as it always was , with its endless souvenir shops , dive centres and tuk-tuk drivers touting for business .
neon signs light up the evening sky , thais and westerners dance the night away and the strip clubs and lap-dancing bars are open into the small hours as usual .
but it would not take long to figure out that something was not quite right .
for one thing , at this time of year phuket is usually heaving with tourists , desperate for a break from the european winter over the christmas and new year holiday .
bbc news : video and audio watch the wave hit but while some foreigners have decided to stay on the island despite the disaster , which has claimed more than 5,000 lives in thailand , the place is still a mere shadow of its former self .

" but we 're still open just the same .

clearing-up just one street down from the rock in dice bar , on the coastal road , any illusion that this is just a normal winter season would be shattered almost immediately .
there are few flashing lights left here , and few shop-fronts which have not been at least partly boarded up .
the pain and loss is never far from sight debris from broken buildings has been swept into neat piles , stacked up on both sides of the road .

you also do not have to go far to see posters of the missing , which relatives have plastered at various points around the island .
in fact , as soon as you leave immigration at the island 's airport , there are posters stuck on pillars and posts , looking somewhat incongruous when placed near advertisements for " the paradise island of phuket " .
it might be possible to clear away much of the wreckage less than two weeks after a disaster of this magnitude , but you can not erase the suffering of those still desperately searching for loved ones .

the clear-up operation has been gaining momentum some thais are even cashing in on the disaster .
on the patong tourist strip , there are at least two shops selling cds showing amateur video footage of the tsunami .
western tourists still choosing to holiday in phuket also say that the best way for the island to move on is to get back to normal as quickly as possible .

"
waveney district council has ruled that the work at easton bavents , near southwold , needs planning permission .
but resident peter boggis disagrees : " i will not stop until they can prove to me i 've broken the law " , he said .
" they are very wrong in their heading of unauthorised tipping ; this is lawful reconstruction of a soft sea defence . "
mr boggis said he plans to complete a defence nearly half a mile long - he began moving earth nearly two years ago .
he believes finishing the job will cost him £ 500,000 .
waveney district council will now have to decide whether to take legal action to enforce the ruling .

developers want to build more than 230 of the tallest wind turbines to be erected in britain on peat moorland in the north of the island .
the scottish executive has made a commitment to renewable energy .
but the lewis scheme is opposed by crofters , island communities and environmental campaigners .
developers are promising millions of pounds will flow to landowners and island communities in royalties . "
if this goes ahead , we 've got to lose 50 % of common grazing " alec macleod crofter supporters insist building and operating the wind farm will bring prosperity to lewis .
but fears have been aired that grazing land will be destroyed by the turbines , road-building and the massive quarries required to support the development .
crofter alec macleod said : " as a crofting area , we rely a lot on common grazing .
if this goes ahead , we 've got to lose 50 % of common grazing .
" this year alone about 5,000 lambs have left this area for the british market , which brings in a great revenue . "
the western isles local authority has not yet agreed its official response to the project .
but some councillors have urged people not to reject wind farms in general until they have weighed up all sides of the argument .
energy targets councillor angus graham said : " i would be willing to sacrifice that pleasing landscape for the economic benefits that will come to these islands .
" these islands have very little going for them currently economically , i think this is a golden opportunity . "
but anti-wind farm campaigner catriona campbell branded the proposals environmental vandalism .
she said : " blanket bog is as rare as the rainforest , rainforest is also remote and undeveloped - would people advocate cutting down the rainforest and putting a wind farm into it ?
" it 's the same thing . "
the final decision will be taken by holyrood ministers .
the towers will be higher than the tallest free-standing structure in scotland - glasgow 's science centre tower - and more than twice the height of the scott monument .
more than 300 jobs would be created during the wind farm 's four-year construction and a further 350 jobs over its 25-year lifetime .
the plans have been lodged by lewis wind power , a joint venture company .
it was formed by british energy and london-based energy firm amec .
the turbines would generate enough green energy to supply electricity to 450,000 homes .
it is estimated that the development could meet about 6 % of the uk 's renewable energy targets and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 1.85 million tonnes per annum , when compared with coal-fired power stations .
the developer claimed the 702-megawatt wind farm could generate up to £ 8m a year for the western isles economy .

developers want to build more than 230 of the tallest wind turbines to be erected in britain on peat moorland in the north of the island .
the scottish executive has made a commitment to renewable energy .

but fears have been aired that grazing land will be destroyed by the turbines , road-building and the massive quarries required to support the development .
crofter alec macleod said : " as a crofting area , we rely a lot on common grazing .
if this goes ahead , we 've got to lose 50 % of common grazing .
" this year alone about 5,000 lambs have left this area for the british market , which brings in a great revenue . "
the western isles local authority has not yet agreed its official response to the project .
but some councillors have urged people not to reject wind farms in general until they have weighed up all sides of the argument .

" these islands have very little going for them currently economically , i think this is a golden opportunity . "
but anti-wind farm campaigner catriona campbell branded the proposals environmental vandalism .

"
waveney district council has ruled that the work at easton bavents , near southwold , needs planning permission .
but resident peter boggis disagrees : " i will not stop until they can prove to me i 've broken the law " , he said .
" they are very wrong in their heading of unauthorised tipping ; this is lawful reconstruction of a soft sea defence . "
mr boggis said he plans to complete a defence nearly half a mile long - he began moving earth nearly two years ago .
he believes finishing the job will cost him £ 500,000 .
waveney district council will now have to decide whether to take legal action to enforce the ruling .
