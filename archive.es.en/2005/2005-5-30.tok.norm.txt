the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .

but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .

under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .

the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .

eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .
" when we heard of that -lrb- chinese action -rrb- we were surprised , " said eu spokeswoman claude veron-reville .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady .

popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 the tattered constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of many opponents of the eu constitution the eu constitution stood as a milestone in european history .
still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .
needless to say , the commercial did n't go over well . nicole scherschun -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : french flex their muscles european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : french vote not the end of europe many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2005 npd attempts election image makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis in suits : the npd 's respectable facade in an bid to take a seat in the bundestag at the next election , the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is targeting young voters and rural areas with a new serious campaign approach . how strong exactly is germany 's right wing national democratic party ?
this is not an easy question to answer .
estimates vary as to how many members the npd could have . in 2004 , the estimates put the number of new members at 300 while a year later it was as high as 5,300 .
then there were the recent elections in schleswig-holstein , where the npd won 1.9 percent of the vote , and north rhine-westphalia , where the radical right secured 0.9 percent .
these results hint at a support nearing 70,000 , up from 2,300 in 2000 . whatever the numbers , it does n't seem enough for the npd .
with early elections due before the end of this year , the npd are looking to gain three direct mandates and cross the five percent threshold which will see them enter the bundestag .
the far-right party is under no illusions , however .
this target is a tall order .
but that is n't stopping them from trying .
a new campaign to attract younger voters and rural voters with more serious policies is currently underway . the npd seems to have been inspired by its recent election successes and the failure of the government to have the party banned under constitutional law .
but despite what the party considers to be a golden period , it continues to be snubbed by the main parties even when members make it onto local authority councils .
the target , therefore , becomes credibility on a federal level .
and for that , the npd needs more support and the targets are young people and people who have escaped the net of the big parties . support in exchange for working for the npd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party is rebranding itself as the " underdog " to attract youngsters who have become disillusioned by the mainstream parties .
" we find these youngsters and politicize them if they are not already .
they work for the party , " uwe leichsenring , an npd member in saxony 's state government said .
leichsenring adds that the youngsters who are attracted to the npd get support in exchange for their allegiance .
" we have a children 's group , a singing group and a climbing group .
we are of the opinion that a child who is not on the street will not get into trouble .
we keep them occupied . " the npd is also targeting the disgruntled workforce in rural areas in its bid to portray itself as a credible alternative in the political arena by campaigning on issues such as the improvement of services and the fight against corruption in places where the main parties have ignored .
but nabil yacoub from the foreign council in dresden believes the party is just employing populism and playing on people 's fears away . rural areas slip through the mainstream net bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the npd continually use their populist slogans , especially at this time of such uncertainty amongst the population regarding rising costs and the state of the social system , " yacoub said .
" in the country areas , they are even more aggressive .
the social infrastructure , education facilities and such is centered on the towns .
the countryside is ignored and the npd finds a receptive audience there .
we sometimes do project days in rural schools and we are shocked by how swayed they are .
many teachers say that they would lose a whole class if they spoke out against the far-right . " in the countryside , the supposed connection between the high proportion of foreigners and increasing unemployment for germans does n't have the same impact as in towns .
but npd representative leichsenring admits that the focus is not just on the danger of foreigners taking jobs but foreigners in general . xenophobic policies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in saxony , the foreigners in the job market make very little impact .
most of them do n't work anyway , mostly because they do n't want to .
the discussion here is whether you want to live in a part of town where it is 80 percent foreigners .
if you like that then there is always the opportunity to live in cologne or frankfurt .
but we do n't want this and those here who do n't want this know who to vote for . " for stephan siegmund , the leader of the lutheran church in the königstein parish , an npd stronghold , this kind of hostility to foreigners is nothing new .
" the npd offers very simplistic answers to very complex questions and many people just want easy answers , " siegmund said .
" however , look at our east german past .
there was also a latent racism .
there was a lot of negativity and hostility towards foreigners . " npd sells national identity and german pride however , the negative posture towards foreigners is only one component of the npd ideology .
the party is also taking up the torch of protecting germany from supranational institutions and the loss of national identity . " one day , the citizens will have to consider which way they want to go , " uwe leichsenring said .
" if they want to go -lrb- the supranational way -rrb- , then they must choose the spd or cdu .
if they want to go the other way then they should choose the npd .
we want back our nation state and not to be steered by brussels .
we want out of eu and nato , to be neutral and to have our own currency along with giving more say to the people . " many see through the new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd members canvass with a public-friendly approach while dressed respectably in suits but many people still see through the new approach and find the old xenophobia , racism and connections with far-right violence hidden behind them . " whatever they say , they are still the npd and wo n't get a shot , " said one resident .
similar opinions throughout the country suggest that the npd will have to adapt into a completely different political entity to gain the support they need to get into the bundestag in the coming election . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right npd prints paper in poland the npd party has long railed against moving jobs abroad to germany 's low-wage and low-cost eastern neighbors .

this is not an easy question to answer .
estimates vary as to how many members the npd could have . in 2004 , the estimates put the number of new members at 300 while a year later it was as high as 5,300 .
then there were the recent elections in schleswig-holstein , where the npd won 1.9 percent of the vote , and north rhine-westphalia , where the radical right secured 0.9 percent .
these results hint at a support nearing 70,000 , up from 2,300 in 2000 . whatever the numbers , it does n't seem enough for the npd .
with early elections due before the end of this year , the npd are looking to gain three direct mandates and cross the five percent threshold which will see them enter the bundestag .
the far-right party is under no illusions , however .
this target is a tall order .
but that is n't stopping them from trying .
a new campaign to attract younger voters and rural voters with more serious policies is currently underway . the npd seems to have been inspired by its recent election successes and the failure of the government to have the party banned under constitutional law .
but despite what the party considers to be a golden period , it continues to be snubbed by the main parties even when members make it onto local authority councils .
the target , therefore , becomes credibility on a federal level .
and for that , the npd needs more support and the targets are young people and people who have escaped the net of the big parties . support in exchange for working for the npd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party is rebranding itself as the " underdog " to attract youngsters who have become disillusioned by the mainstream parties .
" we find these youngsters and politicize them if they are not already .
they work for the party , " uwe leichsenring , an npd member in saxony 's state government said .
leichsenring adds that the youngsters who are attracted to the npd get support in exchange for their allegiance .
" we have a children 's group , a singing group and a climbing group .
we are of the opinion that a child who is not on the street will not get into trouble .
we keep them occupied . " the npd is also targeting the disgruntled workforce in rural areas in its bid to portray itself as a credible alternative in the political arena by campaigning on issues such as the improvement of services and the fight against corruption in places where the main parties have ignored .
but nabil yacoub from the foreign council in dresden believes the party is just employing populism and playing on people 's fears away . rural areas slip through the mainstream net bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the npd continually use their populist slogans , especially at this time of such uncertainty amongst the population regarding rising costs and the state of the social system , " yacoub said .
" in the country areas , they are even more aggressive .
the social infrastructure , education facilities and such is centered on the towns .
the countryside is ignored and the npd finds a receptive audience there .
we sometimes do project days in rural schools and we are shocked by how swayed they are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2005 npd attempts election image makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis in suits : the npd 's respectable facade in an bid to take a seat in the bundestag at the next election , the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is targeting young voters and rural areas with a new serious campaign approach . how strong exactly is germany 's right wing national democratic party ?
this is not an easy question to answer .
estimates vary as to how many members the npd could have . in 2004 , the estimates put the number of new members at 300 while a year later it was as high as 5,300 .
then there were the recent elections in schleswig-holstein , where the npd won 1.9 percent of the vote , and north rhine-westphalia , where the radical right secured 0.9 percent .
these results hint at a support nearing 70,000 , up from 2,300 in 2000 . whatever the numbers , it does n't seem enough for the npd .
with early elections due before the end of this year , the npd are looking to gain three direct mandates and cross the five percent threshold which will see them enter the bundestag .
the far-right party is under no illusions , however .
this target is a tall order .
but that is n't stopping them from trying .
a new campaign to attract younger voters and rural voters with more serious policies is currently underway . the npd seems to have been inspired by its recent election successes and the failure of the government to have the party banned under constitutional law .
but despite what the party considers to be a golden period , it continues to be snubbed by the main parties even when members make it onto local authority councils .
the target , therefore , becomes credibility on a federal level .
and for that , the npd needs more support and the targets are young people and people who have escaped the net of the big parties . support in exchange for working for the npd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party is rebranding itself as the " underdog " to attract youngsters who have become disillusioned by the mainstream parties .
" we find these youngsters and politicize them if they are not already .
they work for the party , " uwe leichsenring , an npd member in saxony 's state government said .
leichsenring adds that the youngsters who are attracted to the npd get support in exchange for their allegiance .
" we have a children 's group , a singing group and a climbing group .
we are of the opinion that a child who is not on the street will not get into trouble .
we keep them occupied . " the npd is also targeting the disgruntled workforce in rural areas in its bid to portray itself as a credible alternative in the political arena by campaigning on issues such as the improvement of services and the fight against corruption in places where the main parties have ignored .
but nabil yacoub from the foreign council in dresden believes the party is just employing populism and playing on people 's fears away . rural areas slip through the mainstream net bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the npd continually use their populist slogans , especially at this time of such uncertainty amongst the population regarding rising costs and the state of the social system , " yacoub said .
" in the country areas , they are even more aggressive .
the social infrastructure , education facilities and such is centered on the towns .
the countryside is ignored and the npd finds a receptive audience there .
we sometimes do project days in rural schools and we are shocked by how swayed they are .
many teachers say that they would lose a whole class if they spoke out against the far-right . " in the countryside , the supposed connection between the high proportion of foreigners and increasing unemployment for germans does n't have the same impact as in towns .
but npd representative leichsenring admits that the focus is not just on the danger of foreigners taking jobs but foreigners in general . xenophobic policies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in saxony , the foreigners in the job market make very little impact .
most of them do n't work anyway , mostly because they do n't want to .
the discussion here is whether you want to live in a part of town where it is 80 percent foreigners .
if you like that then there is always the opportunity to live in cologne or frankfurt .
but we do n't want this and those here who do n't want this know who to vote for . " for stephan siegmund , the leader of the lutheran church in the königstein parish , an npd stronghold , this kind of hostility to foreigners is nothing new .
" the npd offers very simplistic answers to very complex questions and many people just want easy answers , " siegmund said .
" however , look at our east german past .
there was also a latent racism .
there was a lot of negativity and hostility towards foreigners . " npd sells national identity and german pride however , the negative posture towards foreigners is only one component of the npd ideology .
the party is also taking up the torch of protecting germany from supranational institutions and the loss of national identity . " one day , the citizens will have to consider which way they want to go , " uwe leichsenring said .
" if they want to go -lrb- the supranational way -rrb- , then they must choose the spd or cdu .
if they want to go the other way then they should choose the npd .
we want back our nation state and not to be steered by brussels .
we want out of eu and nato , to be neutral and to have our own currency along with giving more say to the people . " many see through the new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd members canvass with a public-friendly approach while dressed respectably in suits but many people still see through the new approach and find the old xenophobia , racism and connections with far-right violence hidden behind them . " whatever they say , they are still the npd and wo n't get a shot , " said one resident .
similar opinions throughout the country suggest that the npd will have to adapt into a completely different political entity to gain the support they need to get into the bundestag in the coming election . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right npd prints paper in poland the npd party has long railed against moving jobs abroad to germany 's low-wage and low-cost eastern neighbors .
but the far-right extremists just got caught printing a party newspaper across the border in poland .
-lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2005 npd attempts election image makeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis in suits : the npd 's respectable facade in an bid to take a seat in the bundestag at the next election , the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- is targeting young voters and rural areas with a new serious campaign approach . how strong exactly is germany 's right wing national democratic party ?
this is not an easy question to answer .
estimates vary as to how many members the npd could have . in 2004 , the estimates put the number of new members at 300 while a year later it was as high as 5,300 .
then there were the recent elections in schleswig-holstein , where the npd won 1.9 percent of the vote , and north rhine-westphalia , where the radical right secured 0.9 percent .
these results hint at a support nearing 70,000 , up from 2,300 in 2000 . whatever the numbers , it does n't seem enough for the npd .
with early elections due before the end of this year , the npd are looking to gain three direct mandates and cross the five percent threshold which will see them enter the bundestag .
the far-right party is under no illusions , however .
this target is a tall order .
but that is n't stopping them from trying .
a new campaign to attract younger voters and rural voters with more serious policies is currently underway . the npd seems to have been inspired by its recent election successes and the failure of the government to have the party banned under constitutional law .
but despite what the party considers to be a golden period , it continues to be snubbed by the main parties even when members make it onto local authority councils .
the target , therefore , becomes credibility on a federal level .
and for that , the npd needs more support and the targets are young people and people who have escaped the net of the big parties . support in exchange for working for the npd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party is rebranding itself as the " underdog " to attract youngsters who have become disillusioned by the mainstream parties .
" we find these youngsters and politicize them if they are not already .
they work for the party , " uwe leichsenring , an npd member in saxony 's state government said .
leichsenring adds that the youngsters who are attracted to the npd get support in exchange for their allegiance .
" we have a children 's group , a singing group and a climbing group .
we are of the opinion that a child who is not on the street will not get into trouble .
we keep them occupied . " the npd is also targeting the disgruntled workforce in rural areas in its bid to portray itself as a credible alternative in the political arena by campaigning on issues such as the improvement of services and the fight against corruption in places where the main parties have ignored .
but nabil yacoub from the foreign council in dresden believes the party is just employing populism and playing on people 's fears away . rural areas slip through the mainstream net bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the npd continually use their populist slogans , especially at this time of such uncertainty amongst the population regarding rising costs and the state of the social system , " yacoub said .
" in the country areas , they are even more aggressive .
the social infrastructure , education facilities and such is centered on the towns .
the countryside is ignored and the npd finds a receptive audience there .
we sometimes do project days in rural schools and we are shocked by how swayed they are .
many teachers say that they would lose a whole class if they spoke out against the far-right . " in the countryside , the supposed connection between the high proportion of foreigners and increasing unemployment for germans does n't have the same impact as in towns .
but npd representative leichsenring admits that the focus is not just on the danger of foreigners taking jobs but foreigners in general . xenophobic policies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in saxony , the foreigners in the job market make very little impact .
most of them do n't work anyway , mostly because they do n't want to .
the discussion here is whether you want to live in a part of town where it is 80 percent foreigners .
if you like that then there is always the opportunity to live in cologne or frankfurt .
but we do n't want this and those here who do n't want this know who to vote for . " for stephan siegmund , the leader of the lutheran church in the königstein parish , an npd stronghold , this kind of hostility to foreigners is nothing new .
" the npd offers very simplistic answers to very complex questions and many people just want easy answers , " siegmund said .
" however , look at our east german past .
there was also a latent racism .
there was a lot of negativity and hostility towards foreigners . " npd sells national identity and german pride however , the negative posture towards foreigners is only one component of the npd ideology .
the party is also taking up the torch of protecting germany from supranational institutions and the loss of national identity . " one day , the citizens will have to consider which way they want to go , " uwe leichsenring said .
" if they want to go -lrb- the supranational way -rrb- , then they must choose the spd or cdu .
if they want to go the other way then they should choose the npd .
we want back our nation state and not to be steered by brussels .
we want out of eu and nato , to be neutral and to have our own currency along with giving more say to the people . " many see through the new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd members canvass with a public-friendly approach while dressed respectably in suits but many people still see through the new approach and find the old xenophobia , racism and connections with far-right violence hidden behind them . " whatever they say , they are still the npd and wo n't get a shot , " said one resident .
similar opinions throughout the country suggest that the npd will have to adapt into a completely different political entity to gain the support they need to get into the bundestag in the coming election . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right npd prints paper in poland the npd party has long railed against moving jobs abroad to germany 's low-wage and low-cost eastern neighbors .

these results hint at a support nearing 70,000 , up from 2,300 in 2000 . whatever the numbers , it does n't seem enough for the npd .
with early elections due before the end of this year , the npd are looking to gain three direct mandates and cross the five percent threshold which will see them enter the bundestag .
the far-right party is under no illusions , however .
this target is a tall order .
but that is n't stopping them from trying .
a new campaign to attract younger voters and rural voters with more serious policies is currently underway . the npd seems to have been inspired by its recent election successes and the failure of the government to have the party banned under constitutional law .
but despite what the party considers to be a golden period , it continues to be snubbed by the main parties even when members make it onto local authority councils .
the target , therefore , becomes credibility on a federal level .
and for that , the npd needs more support and the targets are young people and people who have escaped the net of the big parties . support in exchange for working for the npd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the party is rebranding itself as the " underdog " to attract youngsters who have become disillusioned by the mainstream parties .
" we find these youngsters and politicize them if they are not already .
they work for the party , " uwe leichsenring , an npd member in saxony 's state government said .
leichsenring adds that the youngsters who are attracted to the npd get support in exchange for their allegiance .
" we have a children 's group , a singing group and a climbing group .
we are of the opinion that a child who is not on the street will not get into trouble .
we keep them occupied . " the npd is also targeting the disgruntled workforce in rural areas in its bid to portray itself as a credible alternative in the political arena by campaigning on issues such as the improvement of services and the fight against corruption in places where the main parties have ignored .
but nabil yacoub from the foreign council in dresden believes the party is just employing populism and playing on people 's fears away . rural areas slip through the mainstream net bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the npd continually use their populist slogans , especially at this time of such uncertainty amongst the population regarding rising costs and the state of the social system , " yacoub said .
" in the country areas , they are even more aggressive .
the social infrastructure , education facilities and such is centered on the towns .
the countryside is ignored and the npd finds a receptive audience there .
we sometimes do project days in rural schools and we are shocked by how swayed they are .
many teachers say that they would lose a whole class if they spoke out against the far-right . " in the countryside , the supposed connection between the high proportion of foreigners and increasing unemployment for germans does n't have the same impact as in towns .
but npd representative leichsenring admits that the focus is not just on the danger of foreigners taking jobs but foreigners in general . xenophobic policies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in saxony , the foreigners in the job market make very little impact .
most of them do n't work anyway , mostly because they do n't want to .
the discussion here is whether you want to live in a part of town where it is 80 percent foreigners .
if you like that then there is always the opportunity to live in cologne or frankfurt .
but we do n't want this and those here who do n't want this know who to vote for . " for stephan siegmund , the leader of the lutheran church in the königstein parish , an npd stronghold , this kind of hostility to foreigners is nothing new .
" the npd offers very simplistic answers to very complex questions and many people just want easy answers , " siegmund said .
" however , look at our east german past .
there was also a latent racism .
there was a lot of negativity and hostility towards foreigners . " npd sells national identity and german pride however , the negative posture towards foreigners is only one component of the npd ideology .
the party is also taking up the torch of protecting germany from supranational institutions and the loss of national identity . " one day , the citizens will have to consider which way they want to go , " uwe leichsenring said .
" if they want to go -lrb- the supranational way -rrb- , then they must choose the spd or cdu .
if they want to go the other way then they should choose the npd .
we want back our nation state and not to be steered by brussels .
we want out of eu and nato , to be neutral and to have our own currency along with giving more say to the people . " many see through the new approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd members canvass with a public-friendly approach while dressed respectably in suits but many people still see through the new approach and find the old xenophobia , racism and connections with far-right violence hidden behind them . " whatever they say , they are still the npd and wo n't get a shot , " said one resident .
similar opinions throughout the country suggest that the npd will have to adapt into a completely different political entity to gain the support they need to get into the bundestag in the coming election . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right npd prints paper in poland the npd party has long railed against moving jobs abroad to germany 's low-wage and low-cost eastern neighbors .
but the far-right extremists just got caught printing a party newspaper across the border in poland .
-lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- high court judge reignites npd ban debate a german constitutional court justice said sunday that the neo-nazi npd party could be banned even though a past attempt failed .
the comments have reignited the debate over how best to deal with the extreme-right menace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc fischer sticks to schröder foreign minister joschka fischer said his green party is willing to continue working with social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder despite schröder 's plan to campaign without his coalition partner ahead of early elections .
the coalition between social democrats and greens that has been in power since 1998 is " a relationship that has not always been easy , but which has been very intense , with a great deal of agreement on numerous questions , " fischer said in an interview in monday 's süddeutsche zeitung .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .

there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .

stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "

she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .

she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "

although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .

schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .
schröder has called for a vote of confidence in parliament for july 1 in the first step to triggering early elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a madam chancellor for germany ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 opinion : french vote not the end of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rejection may give the eu time to reflect and consider its next move many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result . the ' non ' vote in the french eu constitution represents one side of a european paradox : france has long been one of the strongest advocates of cooperation and integration within the bloc and yet sunday 's vote against the eu constitution is a clear sign that the french people now reject a contract which would promote these ideals . however , while doom-mongers may now be ringing the death knell of the eu , the french vote may actually give the bloc time to reflect and to take its foot off the gas in the enlargement juggernaut to its benefit . the french ' no ' vote had been signposted for weeks .
it had been clear for over a month that the european constitution would not get a majority vote in favor from the french people . and yet , while the rejectionist camp got stronger , the leaders of the eu states put their heads in the sand .
there was no plan b. even on sunday , current eu president luxembourg 's jean claude juncker and eu commission president jose barroso were at a loss to explain the result . a constant debate of wishes and demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so what happens now ?
even if all the eu member states except france agree on the constitution , which is highly unlikely , the french voice will still remain unchanged until the constitution is amended to their satisfaction .
to change the text of the constitution to get france on board is also unlikely as it would mean that all the eu states would call for their demands to be included , turning the constitution into a continuous debate based on wish lists . no , there is no second chance .
the constitution in this form is dead .
without france it can not be accepted even if the other referendums , like the one taking place in the netherlands on wednesday , get a ' yes ' vote . what now for europe ?
crisis ?
disaster ?
chaos ?
it is doubtful that this nightmare scenario will come to pass despite the obvious rejection of the constitution .
the eu already has a working , although complicated , legal framework with clear rules in the nice agreement . not the end but a chance to rethink and regroup and some , including german eu commissioner günter verheugen , believe that once the repercussions of this setback have been digested , the eu can actually make progress .
the union will go on working and not break up .
france will not resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement will have to be reflected on at a considered pace at first , there will be a pause for reflection on the speed of integration and the progress of enlargement .
only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .
the creation of the eu foreign secretary position could be achieved without it being linked to the constitution as it would be free of many of the issues that prompted the french rejection . turkey bid in danger as chirac 's support could wane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together on turkey last year but what does the future hold for europe 's engine ?
but other areas will suffer - specifically turkey 's accession to the eu .
it is doubtful that negotiations will begin on oct .
3 as planned .
french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .
there will be social and economic challenges , none more so than the differences between west and east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and the man expected to become french prime minister in the wake of the vote , current foreign minister dominique de villepin .
as important will be the need to rebuild bridges within the eu .
jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2005 chinese textiles row heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile exports from china have skyrocketed china has said it is abolishing export duties on 81 categories of its own textile products .
the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .

still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .
needless to say , the commercial did n't go over well . nicole scherschun -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : french flex their muscles european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : french vote not the end of europe many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document .

one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .

it is a small but meaningful difference .

in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document .

no problem .
i 'm on my way to the landing strip " retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth . in their home country of germany , they are no longer seen as useful .
they are pensioners ; retired from the world of work .

" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu politicians react to french " non " politicians from across the spectrum were quick to comment on the defeat in france of the proposed eu constitution .
after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document .
-lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- czech president wants old eu back anyone looking for euroskeptics in the czech republic need n't look far .
czech president vaclav klaus opposes the eu constitution , and hardly a day goes by in which he does n't remind his countrymen and women of the fact .

" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "

she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .

stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .

she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .

but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result . the ' non ' vote in the french eu constitution represents one side of a european paradox : france has long been one of the strongest advocates of cooperation and integration within the bloc and yet sunday 's vote against the eu constitution is a clear sign that the french people now reject a contract which would promote these ideals . however , while doom-mongers may now be ringing the death knell of the eu , the french vote may actually give the bloc time to reflect and to take its foot off the gas in the enlargement juggernaut to its benefit . the french ' no ' vote had been signposted for weeks .
it had been clear for over a month that the european constitution would not get a majority vote in favor from the french people . and yet , while the rejectionist camp got stronger , the leaders of the eu states put their heads in the sand .
there was no plan b. even on sunday , current eu president luxembourg 's jean claude juncker and eu commission president jose barroso were at a loss to explain the result . a constant debate of wishes and demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so what happens now ?
even if all the eu member states except france agree on the constitution , which is highly unlikely , the french voice will still remain unchanged until the constitution is amended to their satisfaction .
to change the text of the constitution to get france on board is also unlikely as it would mean that all the eu states would call for their demands to be included , turning the constitution into a continuous debate based on wish lists . no , there is no second chance .
the constitution in this form is dead .
without france it can not be accepted even if the other referendums , like the one taking place in the netherlands on wednesday , get a ' yes ' vote . what now for europe ?
crisis ?
disaster ?
chaos ?
it is doubtful that this nightmare scenario will come to pass despite the obvious rejection of the constitution .
the eu already has a working , although complicated , legal framework with clear rules in the nice agreement . not the end but a chance to rethink and regroup and some , including german eu commissioner günter verheugen , believe that once the repercussions of this setback have been digested , the eu can actually make progress .
the union will go on working and not break up .
france will not resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement will have to be reflected on at a considered pace at first , there will be a pause for reflection on the speed of integration and the progress of enlargement .
only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .
the creation of the eu foreign secretary position could be achieved without it being linked to the constitution as it would be free of many of the issues that prompted the french rejection . turkey bid in danger as chirac 's support could wane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together on turkey last year but what does the future hold for europe 's engine ?
but other areas will suffer - specifically turkey 's accession to the eu .
it is doubtful that negotiations will begin on oct .
3 as planned .
french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .
there will be social and economic challenges , none more so than the differences between west and east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and the man expected to become french prime minister in the wake of the vote , current foreign minister dominique de villepin .
as important will be the need to rebuild bridges within the eu .
jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .
" it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .
france , a founding member of the union , remains , naturally , within the union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister michele alliot- marie the french rejection of the eu constitution is " a defeat for france and a defeat for europe , " french defence minister michele alliot-marie said sunday after a historic referendum won by opponents of the treaty . her colleague , foreign minister michel barnier called the result a " real disappointment , " although said those who voted " yes " should remain proud of their vote . " it is a test for our country because , and i 've said this before the referendum , it 's going to be tougher and it is going to be tougher for our country to defend its interests , " he said . the vice-president of the european commission , jacques barrot , said the vote reminded him of the rejection of the european defense community in 1954 , although he added : " once a project has been launched , you can not abandon it . " voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france .

" this is a setback for germany 's aim to promote the unification of europe , " said guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . christian wulff , the christian democrat leader of the state of lower saxony , said he greeted the news that the french had overwhelmingly rejected the treaty " with great disappointment .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder , a key ally of chirac and the other half of the franco-german motor behind much of the eu integration drive , said the vote was " a setback " but did not mean the end of the road . " the outcome of the referendum is a setback for the process of ratifying the constitution , but not its end , " schröder said . germany , which with france forms the key axis at the heart of the european project , last friday became the ninth country to ratify the constitution .
the treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of the german parliament , but a referendum was not held . not all are sad but there are voices among the opposition camp who are more than pleased with the outcome , including phillipe de villiers , who played a visible role in the " no " campaign in france . " europe has to be rebuilt .

" for a few years the eu will be in a crisis situation , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 the tattered constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of many opponents of the eu constitution the eu constitution stood as a milestone in european history .
still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .
needless to say , the commercial did n't go over well . nicole scherschun -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : french flex their muscles european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .

she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .
schröder has called for a vote of confidence in parliament for july 1 in the first step to triggering early elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a madam chancellor for germany ?

" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 the tattered constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of many opponents of the eu constitution the eu constitution stood as a milestone in european history .
still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .

dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .

it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .

this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2005 chinese textiles row heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile exports from china have skyrocketed china has said it is abolishing export duties on 81 categories of its own textile products .
the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .
" when we heard of that -lrb- chinese action -rrb- we were surprised , " said eu spokeswoman claude veron-reville .
" we are still willing to discuss , to negotiate , to a mutually satisfactory settlement . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looming eu trade war with china ?
the eu is set to launch a probe into china 's exploding textile exports this week just as trade officials are warning that doing so could be perilous to trade structures and other industries .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- eu , china at loggerheads over textiles the eu 's textile producers are expected to call on the european commission to launch emergency measures to limit booming chinese imports .
beijing has expressed displeasure and warned that bilateral ties could suffer .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .

still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .

9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .
needless to say , the commercial did n't go over well . nicole scherschun -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : french flex their muscles european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : french vote not the end of europe many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .
projections released immediately after polls closed show between 54.5 and 55.6 percent voted against the document .
-lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- feedback what do you think of the eu constitution ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document .

in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .

this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .

no problem .
i 'm on my way to the landing strip " retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth . in their home country of germany , they are no longer seen as useful .
they are pensioners ; retired from the world of work .
but their knowledge and experience is still coveted in some areas of the world despite their age . thanks to an agency which has been giving german pensioners a new lease of life for the past 22 years , retired workers can still be an asset as volunteers in the specialized fields throughout the developing world . the filing cabinets in the ses offices in bonn contain the names of 6400 people .
they come from all walks of life and from diverse areas of the working world : engineers share shelf space with carpenters , doctors and journalists are filed side by side with teachers and chemists . these are all pensioners ; people deemed by the german state to be too old to work .
but at a moment 's notice , in response to a certain need in some far flung corner of the world , any one of these people can be reactivated and sent to lend their skills in a far away land . in the last 12 months , 1,400 of them have seen action as volunteer experts in 90 countries around the world and every day new missions come in from asia , africa , south america and east europe .
these are the countries which can benefit most from the knowledge of germany 's " special forces " of skilled pensioners .
these are the countries which lack personnel with the level of training and experience the retired german professionals can offer .
this is why the ses operatives are getting a second bite of the employment cherry . from couch to honduras via helicopter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich von hohmeier is a perfect example of how ses revived his career after it was deemed legally over .
the 68-year-old certified engineer would be picking up his pension back in germany before tending the garden and falling asleep in front of daytime soap operas had it not been for the chance to extend his working life .
but in honduras , where he has worked many times since joining the ses , von hohmeier goes to work by helicopter . " the first time i was in honduras , i was working on farms very high up in the mountains , " he recalls .
" the only way to get from farm to farm was by helicopter such was the catastrophic state of the roads .
it was the only reasonable option available to get there . " bed , board and professional satisfaction the retired engineer , as with most of the ex-professionals on the ses books , works as a volunteer .
transport , lodging and food are provided by whomever he works for but he collects no wages .
sometimes the project he is working on is supported by the german government and then the expenses are picked up by the state but von hohmeier receives nothing more than his pension in return .
but it is not about the money .
it is about self-worth and helping others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work he and his fellow ses members do also reaps benefits for his home country .
sometimes the pensioners will work on behalf of a german company in a developing nation and will often return to germany with news of lucrative future projects and even offers of more work for his employers . " in almost every situation , something develops , " he adds .
" this is a strong joint venture where everybody benefits , from the people we work for , the country we work in and the german economy . " risk assessment a priority ses understands that they are dealing with workers who are still of sound mind but maybe less sound of body .
that is why the company always makes a thorough assessment of worker and work situation , which could be in a very remote part of the world , to make sure that no one is in danger . " we always look before hand to see if the country is safe for the elderly expert to go to because we are responsible for their welfare and life , " says sonnhild schretzmann from ses . engineer joins exclusive list of china 's heroes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx : right up there with werner gierig china has become the leading employer of ses operatives in the past year and has even honored one of the experts with their own monument in appreciation of their service , an honor which has been awarded to very few germans .
werner gierig , an engineer , joins karl marx and friedrich engels as the only germans to have been honored with their own bust in the people 's republic . gierig worked in china during the 1980s when the people 's republic first began to open up and his work helped to further its development into a modern society .
as a result werner gierig is " a highly praised and beloved man in china , " according to schretzmann . a new lease of life far from ending up on the scrap heap of employment once the retirement threshold has been crossed , german pensioners are continuing to bring their skills to the world and are gaining even more life experience as a result . " i do n't know anything about the area , " ulrich von hohmeier says before jetting off to his next mission in the northwest chinese province of xin jiang .

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .
" it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .
france , a founding member of the union , remains , naturally , within the union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister michele alliot- marie the french rejection of the eu constitution is " a defeat for france and a defeat for europe , " french defence minister michele alliot-marie said sunday after a historic referendum won by opponents of the treaty . her colleague , foreign minister michel barnier called the result a " real disappointment , " although said those who voted " yes " should remain proud of their vote . " it is a test for our country because , and i 've said this before the referendum , it 's going to be tougher and it is going to be tougher for our country to defend its interests , " he said . the vice-president of the european commission , jacques barrot , said the vote reminded him of the rejection of the european defense community in 1954 , although he added : " once a project has been launched , you can not abandon it . " voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france . " it means it is choosing the past and not the future and risks losing its natural role as a political leader in europe , " he said . artis pabriks , foreign minister of another new member state , latvia , said the vote meant eu politicians had to look closely at the signals voters were sending their way .
she urged her own parliament to go ahead with their scheduled vote on thursday and vote the constitution through . " i am convinced that we should stick to the idea of the constitution , " he said .
" we can not turn back .

the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .
" when we heard of that -lrb- chinese action -rrb- we were surprised , " said eu spokeswoman claude veron-reville .

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .

" voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france . " it means it is choosing the past and not the future and risks losing its natural role as a political leader in europe , " he said . artis pabriks , foreign minister of another new member state , latvia , said the vote meant eu politicians had to look closely at the signals voters were sending their way .

" the outcome of the referendum is a setback for the process of ratifying the constitution , but not its end , " schröder said . germany , which with france forms the key axis at the heart of the european project , last friday became the ninth country to ratify the constitution .
the treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of the german parliament , but a referendum was not held . not all are sad but there are voices among the opposition camp who are more than pleased with the outcome , including phillipe de villiers , who played a visible role in the " no " campaign in france .

" for a few years the eu will be in a crisis situation , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2005 merkel chosen as chancellor candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she has high hopes for germany 's upcoming early elections angela merkel , the leader of germany 's opposition christian democrats , has officially been chosen as the conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in early elections in the fall . germany 's opposition conservatives on monday named angela merkel as their candidate to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder in an expected autumn election that could produce the country 's first woman leader .
members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .
schröder has called for a vote of confidence in parliament for july 1 in the first step to triggering early elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a madam chancellor for germany ?

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .
schröder has called for a vote of confidence in parliament for july 1 in the first step to triggering early elections . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a madam chancellor for germany ?

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .
" it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .

" it is a test for our country because , and i 've said this before the referendum , it 's going to be tougher and it is going to be tougher for our country to defend its interests , " he said . the vice-president of the european commission , jacques barrot , said the vote reminded him of the rejection of the european defense community in 1954 , although he added : " once a project has been launched , you can not abandon it . " voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france . " it means it is choosing the past and not the future and risks losing its natural role as a political leader in europe , " he said . artis pabriks , foreign minister of another new member state , latvia , said the vote meant eu politicians had to look closely at the signals voters were sending their way .
she urged her own parliament to go ahead with their scheduled vote on thursday and vote the constitution through . " i am convinced that we should stick to the idea of the constitution , " he said .

" this is a setback for germany 's aim to promote the unification of europe , " said guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . christian wulff , the christian democrat leader of the state of lower saxony , said he greeted the news that the french had overwhelmingly rejected the treaty " with great disappointment .

" the outcome of the referendum is a setback for the process of ratifying the constitution , but not its end , " schröder said . germany , which with france forms the key axis at the heart of the european project , last friday became the ninth country to ratify the constitution .
the treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of the german parliament , but a referendum was not held . not all are sad but there are voices among the opposition camp who are more than pleased with the outcome , including phillipe de villiers , who played a visible role in the " no " campaign in france . " europe has to be rebuilt .
the constitution is no more , " he said .
" the people have said no massively .
there is no more constitution . " bildunterschrift : leftist constitution opponents celebrate their victory on sunday he said france was now confronted with a major political crisis which could only be solved by the president .
he advised chirac to either resign , or to dissolve the national assembly . according to gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn in germany , the vote in france was a vote against jacques chirac , but also against an eu that was going too fast for many . " for a few years the eu will be in a crisis situation , " he said .
" there will be an attempt to build things up again , but france is one of the founding members of the european union and so this " no " is a challenge that will not easily be overcome . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 opinion : what germany needs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder or angela merkel : the choice is germany 's as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .
merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document .

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .
" it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .
france , a founding member of the union , remains , naturally , within the union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister michele alliot- marie the french rejection of the eu constitution is " a defeat for france and a defeat for europe , " french defence minister michele alliot-marie said sunday after a historic referendum won by opponents of the treaty . her colleague , foreign minister michel barnier called the result a " real disappointment , " although said those who voted " yes " should remain proud of their vote . " it is a test for our country because , and i 've said this before the referendum , it 's going to be tougher and it is going to be tougher for our country to defend its interests , " he said . the vice-president of the european commission , jacques barrot , said the vote reminded him of the rejection of the european defense community in 1954 , although he added : " once a project has been launched , you can not abandon it . " voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france . " it means it is choosing the past and not the future and risks losing its natural role as a political leader in europe , " he said . artis pabriks , foreign minister of another new member state , latvia , said the vote meant eu politicians had to look closely at the signals voters were sending their way .
she urged her own parliament to go ahead with their scheduled vote on thursday and vote the constitution through . " i am convinced that we should stick to the idea of the constitution , " he said .
" we can not turn back .
it would be a disaster . " germany : setback for europe german politicians from across the political spectrum described the " no " in sunday 's referendum on the eu constitution in france as a step backwards and a setback for germany 's attempts to unify europe . " this is a setback for germany 's aim to promote the unification of europe , " said guido westerwelle , the leader of the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- . christian wulff , the christian democrat leader of the state of lower saxony , said he greeted the news that the french had overwhelmingly rejected the treaty " with great disappointment . " klaus wowereit , the mayor of berlin and a member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democrats , described the outcome as " a step backwards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder chancellor gerhard schröder , a key ally of chirac and the other half of the franco-german motor behind much of the eu integration drive , said the vote was " a setback " but did not mean the end of the road . " the outcome of the referendum is a setback for the process of ratifying the constitution , but not its end , " schröder said . germany , which with france forms the key axis at the heart of the european project , last friday became the ninth country to ratify the constitution .
the treaty was overwhelmingly approved by both houses of the german parliament , but a referendum was not held . not all are sad but there are voices among the opposition camp who are more than pleased with the outcome , including phillipe de villiers , who played a visible role in the " no " campaign in france . " europe has to be rebuilt .
the constitution is no more , " he said .
" the people have said no massively .
there is no more constitution . " bildunterschrift : leftist constitution opponents celebrate their victory on sunday he said france was now confronted with a major political crisis which could only be solved by the president .
he advised chirac to either resign , or to dissolve the national assembly . according to gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn in germany , the vote in france was a vote against jacques chirac , but also against an eu that was going too fast for many . " for a few years the eu will be in a crisis situation , " he said .
" there will be an attempt to build things up again , but france is one of the founding members of the european union and so this " no " is a challenge that will not easily be overcome . "

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

no problem .
i 'm on my way to the landing strip " retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth . in their home country of germany , they are no longer seen as useful .
they are pensioners ; retired from the world of work .
but their knowledge and experience is still coveted in some areas of the world despite their age . thanks to an agency which has been giving german pensioners a new lease of life for the past 22 years , retired workers can still be an asset as volunteers in the specialized fields throughout the developing world . the filing cabinets in the ses offices in bonn contain the names of 6400 people .
they come from all walks of life and from diverse areas of the working world : engineers share shelf space with carpenters , doctors and journalists are filed side by side with teachers and chemists . these are all pensioners ; people deemed by the german state to be too old to work .
but at a moment 's notice , in response to a certain need in some far flung corner of the world , any one of these people can be reactivated and sent to lend their skills in a far away land . in the last 12 months , 1,400 of them have seen action as volunteer experts in 90 countries around the world and every day new missions come in from asia , africa , south america and east europe .

the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .
" when we heard of that -lrb- chinese action -rrb- we were surprised , " said eu spokeswoman claude veron-reville .

the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .

but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result . the ' non ' vote in the french eu constitution represents one side of a european paradox : france has long been one of the strongest advocates of cooperation and integration within the bloc and yet sunday 's vote against the eu constitution is a clear sign that the french people now reject a contract which would promote these ideals . however , while doom-mongers may now be ringing the death knell of the eu , the french vote may actually give the bloc time to reflect and to take its foot off the gas in the enlargement juggernaut to its benefit . the french ' no ' vote had been signposted for weeks .
it had been clear for over a month that the european constitution would not get a majority vote in favor from the french people . and yet , while the rejectionist camp got stronger , the leaders of the eu states put their heads in the sand .
there was no plan b. even on sunday , current eu president luxembourg 's jean claude juncker and eu commission president jose barroso were at a loss to explain the result . a constant debate of wishes and demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so what happens now ?
even if all the eu member states except france agree on the constitution , which is highly unlikely , the french voice will still remain unchanged until the constitution is amended to their satisfaction .
to change the text of the constitution to get france on board is also unlikely as it would mean that all the eu states would call for their demands to be included , turning the constitution into a continuous debate based on wish lists . no , there is no second chance .
the constitution in this form is dead .
without france it can not be accepted even if the other referendums , like the one taking place in the netherlands on wednesday , get a ' yes ' vote . what now for europe ?
crisis ?
disaster ?
chaos ?
it is doubtful that this nightmare scenario will come to pass despite the obvious rejection of the constitution .
the eu already has a working , although complicated , legal framework with clear rules in the nice agreement . not the end but a chance to rethink and regroup and some , including german eu commissioner günter verheugen , believe that once the repercussions of this setback have been digested , the eu can actually make progress .
the union will go on working and not break up .
france will not resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement will have to be reflected on at a considered pace at first , there will be a pause for reflection on the speed of integration and the progress of enlargement .
only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .
the creation of the eu foreign secretary position could be achieved without it being linked to the constitution as it would be free of many of the issues that prompted the french rejection . turkey bid in danger as chirac 's support could wane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together on turkey last year but what does the future hold for europe 's engine ?
but other areas will suffer - specifically turkey 's accession to the eu .
it is doubtful that negotiations will begin on oct .
3 as planned .
french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .
there will be social and economic challenges , none more so than the differences between west and east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and the man expected to become french prime minister in the wake of the vote , current foreign minister dominique de villepin .
as important will be the need to rebuild bridges within the eu .
jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .

french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .

jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday . french president jacques chirac , who invested much political capital in the " yes " campaign , noted in a broadcast after the polls closed that the french people had indeed spoken . " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority , " he said .
" it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .
france , a founding member of the union , remains , naturally , within the union . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french defense minister michele alliot- marie the french rejection of the eu constitution is " a defeat for france and a defeat for europe , " french defence minister michele alliot-marie said sunday after a historic referendum won by opponents of the treaty . her colleague , foreign minister michel barnier called the result a " real disappointment , " although said those who voted " yes " should remain proud of their vote . " it is a test for our country because , and i 've said this before the referendum , it 's going to be tougher and it is going to be tougher for our country to defend its interests , " he said . the vice-president of the european commission , jacques barrot , said the vote reminded him of the rejection of the european defense community in 1954 , although he added : " once a project has been launched , you can not abandon it . " voices from new states polish foreign ministry official pawel swieboda called the decision a defeat for france . " it means it is choosing the past and not the future and risks losing its natural role as a political leader in europe , " he said . artis pabriks , foreign minister of another new member state , latvia , said the vote meant eu politicians had to look closely at the signals voters were sending their way .
she urged her own parliament to go ahead with their scheduled vote on thursday and vote the constitution through . " i am convinced that we should stick to the idea of the constitution , " he said .
" we can not turn back .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .

merkel was a latecomer to politics , working as a physicist in east berlin before joining a pro-democracy group in 1989 .
she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .

one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .

she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .

she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .

the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady .

popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 press review : french flex their muscles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely a " no " vote european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes . many french newspapers such as le figaro called the vote a flexing of french muscle .
" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .
but it is a chance to take a closer look at the way european unity is being managed .
whether the next attempt at a better eu constitution or the next enlargement of the eu : the eu must learn that if it wants to survive , it has to finally allow the spirit of democracy to live . " spain 's el mundo remarked : with their egotism and their implacability , the french have plunged the eu into its greatest crisis yet .
if a smaller or middle-sized country had rejected the eu constitution , the vote could have been repeated .
but not in france , also because of the high participation of voters participating which bestowed on it such a high degree of legitimacy .
now the eu constitution is at an impasse ... and europe turns back to an era of nationalism . moscow 's daily newspaper kommersant called the rejection a symbolic act with little practical effect : " above all , it is a symbolic act with little influence on the practical matters ... and will change little , even if the dutch add their ' no ' on wednesday .
the euro and the schengen agreement are , for european unity , more important than a symbolic document .

" the french have realized their real power , to bend european construction towards their will and with it the destiny of 450 million people . " other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "

still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .

" other newspapers in france saw the referendum 's results as a rejection of chirac : it was a vote on " the political class with its head in the sand , accustomed to lying over many years , notoriously incompetent and at the bidding of the president , " wrote liberation .
it is " a general disaster and an epidemic of populism sweeping away everything in its way - european integration , enlargement , elites , control of market forces , reformism , internationalism , even generosity . "
in london , the financial times commented : " the reasons for the french ' no ' are diffuse .
part is clearly a backlash against mr chirac from the left , combining frustration at the failure of his government to reduce unemployment , and a powerful anti-globalisation movement blaming international competition for france 's plight .
but that fear of competition has been confused with anxiety about the effect of eu enlargement , with france losing influence in a 25-member union and losing jobs to cheaper labor in the east ... on balance , it would seem most sensible to allow the ratification process to continue , even if it does mean that others may vote ' no , ' including the uk .
only when it is clear where all the members stand can a sensible effort be made to rework the treaty .
the french ' no ' is a shock .
it is also an opportunity for a fundamental debate to be held on the shape of the future eu . "
the euroskeptic british press was more gleeful .
" in defiance of a united media , a monolithically pro-brussels political class and blizzards of propaganda , they -lrb- the french -rrb- have said a resounding ' non ' to the euro-elites who have governed them for half a century , " wrote the daily telegraph . the tabloid daily mail commented : " a grotesque and wrong-headed document has been all but buried . "
the süddeutsche zeitung in munich attributed the french rejection as anger and alienation from far-away brussels bureaucrats and opined : " the eu has suffered a setback .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 opinion : what germany needs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder or angela merkel : the choice is germany 's as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

still , such large undertakings can , of course , go askew .
dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .
the polish parliamentary deputies complain that they have not been able to debate the constitutional rules , the ones changed from the original draft and seen as most important .
and even though the referendum over the constitution was planned for the same day as the presidential election oct .
9 , now it has to be held three to four months later . bildunterschrift : the french vote is n't the only problem for this reason , polish enthusiasm for the eu is ebbing somewhat .
the government had arranged it so well : polish voters could go to the polls once and vote for a president and an eu constitution .
and through this scheme , the government had hoped for high voter turnout , maybe even crossing the magical boundary of 50 percent perhaps . latvians look away in latvia , translators of the eu constitution made about 500 mistakes in the text , about 160 really grave ones .
this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .
the lithuanian and hungary parliaments were the first to ratify the constitution , at the end of 2004 .
at that time , one-third of eu residents had not heard of the document . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what constitution ?
the least amount of information seems to be available in cyprus : when asked about the eu constitution , 65 percent of those polled responded , " excuse me ? "
and the germans ?
well , according to surveys , one-third has no idea what the constitution is .
as a result , the eu has prepared detailed information , available for free on the internet , something most are passing up . the government of the czech republic has gone on the offensive to prepare for the vote on the constitution in june 2006 .
next month , they will begin a campaign to educate voters by distributing 100,000 copies of the document for free .
but that 's not making it thinner nor more exciting than the original . panic before the vote and in some cases , one could try gaining support for the constitution in yet other ways , as in the netherlands , where the number of opponents to the constitution is steadily increasing . there , dutch eu parliamentarian jules maaten from the liberal party , the vvd , has been appearing on tv spots promoting the constitution , along with pictures of the holocaust , the war crimes in bosnia and the terrorist attack in madrid .
needless to say , the commercial did n't go over well . nicole scherschun -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : french flex their muscles european newspapers went from raging at the french rejection of the eu constitution to calling it an opportunity to listen to voters who feel remote from the brussels bureaucracy in a manner that fits with their wishes .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : french vote not the end of europe many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .

dw-world has compiled a list of such blips , both large and small . what was the difference between a qualified and simple majority again ?
one thing is for sure : they are not the same thing .
a qualified majority is one receiving more than 50 percent of the vote -lrb- sometimes two-thirds and often three-fourths of the vote . -rrb-
a simple majority means that one side received more votes than the other .
period .
it is a small but meaningful difference .
unfortunately , it is also one that polish translators of the eu constitution overlooked in their haste . grave oversights the eu constitution is studded with technical terms , unwieldy sentences and bureaucratese , not to mention that it is an epic 500 pages .
in the end , the rush has not been worthwhile , producing rage and revolt : in poland , ratification of the document has had to be postponed because of the mistakes in translation .

this is due to the extreme overload faced by latvian translators in brussels , the foreign ministry said .
in no way would the translators falsify the contents of the document which will be presented to parliament for ratification .
instead , the mistakes occurred when the translators tried to abide by the eu schedule , said artis pabriks , foreign minister of latvia . it almost seems as if people thought that no one would read the constitution that carefully .
that 's not a completely outrageous assumption : most people have not only never looked at it but also do n't know that there is a constitution at all .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .

but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need . i like gerd .
there , i 've said it straight at the beginning of this column .
if i had to choose whom i 'd rather sit down with at my local biergarten to share a beer and some conversation , gerhard schröder would defeat angela merkel by a landslide .
and not just because i know he enjoys a decent cold one now and again . over the past seven years he 's been chancellor , schröder has grown on me .
and i think he 's grown into the office .
after a rather rocky start in 1998 and with plenty of fits and starts , schröder has started thinking less like a politician and more like a statesman .
that 's why i imagine he decided to move the next general election forward by year . despite the very good possibility that voters will end his career this fall by turfing out his center-left coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and environmentalist greens , it appears schröder realized germany - hobbled by high unemployment and weak growth - can not afford another year of political paralysis .
and that is exactly what the country would have faced following the crushing defeat of the spd in last week 's key state election in north rhine-westphalia . throwing down the gauntlet admittedly , there was plenty of political motivation behind the decision to call an early election - in many ways schröder is throwing down the gauntlet to his own party as much as to the opposition . after suffering a string of defeats in state elections , the left-wingers in the spd have demanded the chancellor abandon his rather unpopular welfare cuts and labor market reforms that go by the name agenda 2010 .
now he 's made clear that the party chooses to leave the path of reform at its own peril and certainly without him at the helm . it has also caught his opponents on the other side of the aisle off guard and sent them scrambling to throw together a campaign platform in time for an election likely to be held this september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have n't really been going uphill for germany as of late average germans , by in large , seem to realize their country is in desperate need of an overhaul if it is to overcome its economic woes and be able to compete in the age of globalization .
but as the fortunes of the spd under schröder 's stewardship show , few seem willing to support politicians that take the unpopular yet necessary steps to get things back on track . of course , nobody likes to be told they 've got to tighten their belt , but there 's a rather unpleasant mood prevailing in germany these days .
it smacks of a self-pitying entitlement mentality that even schröder has addressed . the country has lately reminded me of the character in any number of catastrophe films that starts to scream how everyone is going to die .
what 's needed now is a cool-headed protagonist to come over and slap some sense into germany and tell everyone to snap out of it . gerd or angie ? and that 's where we get to the point of this column : sure , i 'd pick schröder as someone i 'd chat with over a beer , but would i vote for him , if i could ?
while he certainly seems to be aware that tough choices need to be made in order to tackle the myriad problems plaguing germany , i 'm not so sure large sections of his party are . many left-wingers in spd and elsewhere appear to be engaging in a grand case of willing suspension of disbelief to enjoy their own little fictional reality .
some seem totally unaware that germany has long been living above its means for years .
even before the government 's -lrb- rather modest -rrb- labor market reforms dubbed hartz iv went into effect last year , a broad coalition of disgruntled trade unionists and old school socialists started to howl hysterically that schröder was gutting germany 's generous – and utterly untenable – welfare state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trade union view of us investors .
fears of " american-style capitalism " descending upon germany 's precious social market system might be overblown , but that constant pressure from the left has kept schröder from taking more dramatic steps to reduce the ranks of germany 's unemployed - currently near 12 percent of the total workforce .
and oddly , that failure has buoyed merkel 's christian democrats , who most likely will impose more drastic measures to spark economic growth if they get elected . in effect , germans do n't like what schröder has done , so they 're going to put somebody in office that will give them a double portion of it .
such a disconnect may be illogical , but if it brings to berlin a government that can shake germany out of its current stupor , then so be it . plus , then gerd may have enough time to meet me in the biergarten .
the first round is on me . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.05.2005 chinese textiles row heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : textile exports from china have skyrocketed china has said it is abolishing export duties on 81 categories of its own textile products .
the move has escalated tensions with the european union and united states , which have set new curbs on chinese textile imports . in an abrupt turnaround , beijing 's finance ministry on monday said it was revoking a decision made only ten days ago to impose export taxes on textile and clothing products .
the move follows decisions by the european union and united states to limit imports after a steep surge in shipments this year .
the us has imposed import quotas on seven categories of chinese textile goods , insisting that china 's exports benefit unfairly from its undervalued currency , the yuan , and low labor costs .
the eu is seeking formal talks with beijing over exports of flax yard and t-shirts , bringing it a step closer to imposing limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai " if the eu and us disregard the important measures and policies the chinese government has taken and decide to impose restrictive measures over chinese textile products , then as a response ... we will also adjust our own policy , " said china 's commerce minister , bo xilai .
jump in exports since the beginning of the year , when the global quota system on clothing and textiles was abolished , china had imposed duties of between two and four percent on 148 types of textile goods to limit the impact on it trading partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the tariffs have had little effect and chinese textile exports jumped 29 percent in the first three months of this year .
eu figures show imports of chinese t-shirts rose 187 percent in the first quarter of 2005 .
international pressure has been mounting on beijing to do more to stem the flood .
to appease concerns in brussels and washington , china announced on may 20 that it would raise duties in 74 categories beginning june 1 .
but beijing has been angered by calls to curb its exports , saying that the eu and us both knew the quota system would end under a 1995 agreement and so had no one to blame but themselves for not being prepared .
" if developed countries had eliminated their textile quota restrictions step by step , the surge in chinese textile exports to their markets this year would have been avoided , " bo said .
harsh words , but still talking china argues that the actions undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels and are a threat to global trade liberalization efforts .
over the weekend , china 's commerce ministry blasted the eu as protectionist .
under world trade organization rules , china is supposed to take steps to drastically cut exports of two types of clothing .
if it fails to do this , brussels is entitled to impose its own limits that can be renewed until the end of 2008 .
despite the coarse tone coming from beijing , the chinese commerce ministry suggested on monday that everything was open to negotiation .
us commerce secretary carlos gutierrez is due in beijing this week to discuss the matter .
the european union said monday it was " surprised " by china 's decision to scrap concessions meant to avert a trade war over textiles , but appealed to beijing to continue talks .
" when we heard of that -lrb- chinese action -rrb- we were surprised , " said eu spokeswoman claude veron-reville .
" we are still willing to discuss , to negotiate , to a mutually satisfactory settlement . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looming eu trade war with china ?
the eu is set to launch a probe into china 's exploding textile exports this week just as trade officials are warning that doing so could be perilous to trade structures and other industries .

members of merkel 's cdu party and its bavarian sister organization , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- nominated the 50-year-old to run for germany 's head of government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , state premier for bavaria and chancellor candidate in 2002 , supports merkel the last possible obstacle to her nomination fell when csu leader edmund stoiber backed her at a meeting of the parties ' top officials .
stoiber had beaten off a challenge from merkel to be the opposition candidate at the 2002 general election , but lost that vote to schröder who was re-elected for a second term as chancellor .
standing alongside merkel , stoiber told a gathering of party workers and the media that her nomination had been unanimous and she had " the full mandate and the full support of the csu and cdu . "
" i am going to do everything i can to help you become germany 's first woman chancellor , " stoiber said .
a leading csu official , michael glos , said on monday that stoiber would take up a " leading role alongside merkel . "
unemployment a priority to the sound of rapturous applause , merkel said her priority would be to reduce german unemployment , which is hovering around the five million mark .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel to likely face off in september " germany no longer needs an agenda 2010 , it needs an agenda for work , " she said , referring to schröder 's largely unpopular program of economic reforms .
she said the cdu would adopt its election program at a party conference in dortmund on august 28 , while the csu would do the same in early september , possibly just two weeks before the election .
the christian democrats are widely expected to win , according to opinion polls , as merkel faces off against the beleaguered social democratic leader who has seen his popularity plummet in the face of a stagnant economy and dissatisfaction over the direction of the country .
eastern roots the 50-year-old divorced daughter of a protestant pastor was born in hamburg in what was then west germany but grew up in communist east germany .

she later become a spokeswoman for east germany 's first and only democratically elected leader , prime minister lothar de maiziere .
she joined the christian democrats in august 1990 , becoming a member of parliament later that year .
she became leader of the party of former chancellor helmut kohl in 2000 and gradually won her colleagues ' respect , even though the childless divorcee defies the stereotype of the male-dominated christian democrats .
the christian democrat leader of the state of saxony-anhalt , wolfgang böhmer , told german radio that having a woman candidate for chancellor was a " a normal development , which is in tune with the times . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher merkel has inevitably been compared to margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- , britain 's first and only female prime minister , but her politics are less radical than the free-market model advocated by the " iron lady . "
popularity growing merkel 's nomination came after she moved ahead of schröder in opinion polls for the first time .
although generally seen as less charismatic than the chancellor , she gained the support of 50 percent of respondents in poll for german state tv released on friday , compared with 44 percent for schröder .
however the german leader is not directly elected by the voters , but by members of parliament after a general election .
schröder surprised the country with his call for an early election after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was heavily defeated by the cdu in a state election in north rhine-westphalia this month .
the latest poll showed that support for the spd had slumped to 27 percent against 52 percent for the christian democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 opinion : french vote not the end of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rejection may give the eu time to reflect and consider its next move many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result . the ' non ' vote in the french eu constitution represents one side of a european paradox : france has long been one of the strongest advocates of cooperation and integration within the bloc and yet sunday 's vote against the eu constitution is a clear sign that the french people now reject a contract which would promote these ideals . however , while doom-mongers may now be ringing the death knell of the eu , the french vote may actually give the bloc time to reflect and to take its foot off the gas in the enlargement juggernaut to its benefit . the french ' no ' vote had been signposted for weeks .
it had been clear for over a month that the european constitution would not get a majority vote in favor from the french people . and yet , while the rejectionist camp got stronger , the leaders of the eu states put their heads in the sand .
there was no plan b. even on sunday , current eu president luxembourg 's jean claude juncker and eu commission president jose barroso were at a loss to explain the result . a constant debate of wishes and demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so what happens now ?
even if all the eu member states except france agree on the constitution , which is highly unlikely , the french voice will still remain unchanged until the constitution is amended to their satisfaction .
to change the text of the constitution to get france on board is also unlikely as it would mean that all the eu states would call for their demands to be included , turning the constitution into a continuous debate based on wish lists . no , there is no second chance .
the constitution in this form is dead .
without france it can not be accepted even if the other referendums , like the one taking place in the netherlands on wednesday , get a ' yes ' vote . what now for europe ?
crisis ?
disaster ?
chaos ?
it is doubtful that this nightmare scenario will come to pass despite the obvious rejection of the constitution .
the eu already has a working , although complicated , legal framework with clear rules in the nice agreement . not the end but a chance to rethink and regroup and some , including german eu commissioner günter verheugen , believe that once the repercussions of this setback have been digested , the eu can actually make progress .
the union will go on working and not break up .
france will not resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement will have to be reflected on at a considered pace at first , there will be a pause for reflection on the speed of integration and the progress of enlargement .
only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .
the creation of the eu foreign secretary position could be achieved without it being linked to the constitution as it would be free of many of the issues that prompted the french rejection . turkey bid in danger as chirac 's support could wane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together on turkey last year but what does the future hold for europe 's engine ?
but other areas will suffer - specifically turkey 's accession to the eu .
it is doubtful that negotiations will begin on oct .
3 as planned .
french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .
there will be social and economic challenges , none more so than the differences between west and east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and the man expected to become french prime minister in the wake of the vote , current foreign minister dominique de villepin .
as important will be the need to rebuild bridges within the eu .
jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2005 opinion : french vote not the end of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rejection may give the eu time to reflect and consider its next move many have already started reading the european union the last rites after the french rejected the eu constitution on sunday .
but far from killing it off , the eu may in the long run benefit from the result . the ' non ' vote in the french eu constitution represents one side of a european paradox : france has long been one of the strongest advocates of cooperation and integration within the bloc and yet sunday 's vote against the eu constitution is a clear sign that the french people now reject a contract which would promote these ideals . however , while doom-mongers may now be ringing the death knell of the eu , the french vote may actually give the bloc time to reflect and to take its foot off the gas in the enlargement juggernaut to its benefit . the french ' no ' vote had been signposted for weeks .
it had been clear for over a month that the european constitution would not get a majority vote in favor from the french people . and yet , while the rejectionist camp got stronger , the leaders of the eu states put their heads in the sand .
there was no plan b. even on sunday , current eu president luxembourg 's jean claude juncker and eu commission president jose barroso were at a loss to explain the result . a constant debate of wishes and demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so what happens now ?
even if all the eu member states except france agree on the constitution , which is highly unlikely , the french voice will still remain unchanged until the constitution is amended to their satisfaction .
to change the text of the constitution to get france on board is also unlikely as it would mean that all the eu states would call for their demands to be included , turning the constitution into a continuous debate based on wish lists . no , there is no second chance .
the constitution in this form is dead .
without france it can not be accepted even if the other referendums , like the one taking place in the netherlands on wednesday , get a ' yes ' vote . what now for europe ?
crisis ?
disaster ?
chaos ?
it is doubtful that this nightmare scenario will come to pass despite the obvious rejection of the constitution .
the eu already has a working , although complicated , legal framework with clear rules in the nice agreement . not the end but a chance to rethink and regroup and some , including german eu commissioner günter verheugen , believe that once the repercussions of this setback have been digested , the eu can actually make progress .
the union will go on working and not break up .
france will not resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement will have to be reflected on at a considered pace at first , there will be a pause for reflection on the speed of integration and the progress of enlargement .
only after such consideration , which may take years , can the constitution project and the streamlining and democratization of the decision-processes within the eu continue . it is also conceivable that some policy areas can be addressed successfully outside the constitution debate .
the creation of the eu foreign secretary position could be achieved without it being linked to the constitution as it would be free of many of the issues that prompted the french rejection . turkey bid in danger as chirac 's support could wane bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together on turkey last year but what does the future hold for europe 's engine ?
but other areas will suffer - specifically turkey 's accession to the eu .
it is doubtful that negotiations will begin on oct .
3 as planned .
french president jacques chirac , along with german chancellor gerhard schröder , was one of the strongest advocates of turkey 's entry to the eu but the negative referendum has surely weakened his position . chirac will be more skeptical in future after the majority of french people rejected the eu 's present course .
schröder himself may even be removed from power by the end of the year and replaced by a conservative alternative , further decreasing the support turkey has in the bloc . romania and bulgaria , in contrast , have already signed their contracts to join the eu but it is hard to say at this point whether the french vote will have any effect on their accession . the need to adapt and rebuild the repercussions will not end there but the eu must face them and adapt .
there will be social and economic challenges , none more so than the differences between west and east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac and the man expected to become french prime minister in the wake of the vote , current foreign minister dominique de villepin .
as important will be the need to rebuild bridges within the eu .
jacques chirac 's stock in brussels has dropped considerably due to the fact that he put the vote to a populace of angry people rather than ratifying it through government , a choice he ignored .
chirac chose domestic affairs over europe and if the eu is to progress from the french rejection of the constitution , its leaders will have to be seen to be working for the good of the bloc . bernd riegert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france votes down eu constitution after a large voter turnout , france has overwhelmingly said " non " to the proposed eu constitution .

no problem .
i 'm on my way to the landing strip " retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth . in their home country of germany , they are no longer seen as useful .
they are pensioners ; retired from the world of work .
but their knowledge and experience is still coveted in some areas of the world despite their age . thanks to an agency which has been giving german pensioners a new lease of life for the past 22 years , retired workers can still be an asset as volunteers in the specialized fields throughout the developing world . the filing cabinets in the ses offices in bonn contain the names of 6400 people .
they come from all walks of life and from diverse areas of the working world : engineers share shelf space with carpenters , doctors and journalists are filed side by side with teachers and chemists . these are all pensioners ; people deemed by the german state to be too old to work .
but at a moment 's notice , in response to a certain need in some far flung corner of the world , any one of these people can be reactivated and sent to lend their skills in a far away land . in the last 12 months , 1,400 of them have seen action as volunteer experts in 90 countries around the world and every day new missions come in from asia , africa , south america and east europe .
these are the countries which can benefit most from the knowledge of germany 's " special forces " of skilled pensioners .
these are the countries which lack personnel with the level of training and experience the retired german professionals can offer .
this is why the ses operatives are getting a second bite of the employment cherry . from couch to honduras via helicopter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich von hohmeier is a perfect example of how ses revived his career after it was deemed legally over .
the 68-year-old certified engineer would be picking up his pension back in germany before tending the garden and falling asleep in front of daytime soap operas had it not been for the chance to extend his working life .
but in honduras , where he has worked many times since joining the ses , von hohmeier goes to work by helicopter . " the first time i was in honduras , i was working on farms very high up in the mountains , " he recalls .
" the only way to get from farm to farm was by helicopter such was the catastrophic state of the roads .
it was the only reasonable option available to get there . " bed , board and professional satisfaction the retired engineer , as with most of the ex-professionals on the ses books , works as a volunteer .
transport , lodging and food are provided by whomever he works for but he collects no wages .
sometimes the project he is working on is supported by the german government and then the expenses are picked up by the state but von hohmeier receives nothing more than his pension in return .
but it is not about the money .
it is about self-worth and helping others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work he and his fellow ses members do also reaps benefits for his home country .
sometimes the pensioners will work on behalf of a german company in a developing nation and will often return to germany with news of lucrative future projects and even offers of more work for his employers . " in almost every situation , something develops , " he adds .
" this is a strong joint venture where everybody benefits , from the people we work for , the country we work in and the german economy . " risk assessment a priority ses understands that they are dealing with workers who are still of sound mind but maybe less sound of body .
that is why the company always makes a thorough assessment of worker and work situation , which could be in a very remote part of the world , to make sure that no one is in danger . " we always look before hand to see if the country is safe for the elderly expert to go to because we are responsible for their welfare and life , " says sonnhild schretzmann from ses . engineer joins exclusive list of china 's heroes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl marx : right up there with werner gierig china has become the leading employer of ses operatives in the past year and has even honored one of the experts with their own monument in appreciation of their service , an honor which has been awarded to very few germans .
werner gierig , an engineer , joins karl marx and friedrich engels as the only germans to have been honored with their own bust in the people 's republic . gierig worked in china during the 1980s when the people 's republic first began to open up and his work helped to further its development into a modern society .
as a result werner gierig is " a highly praised and beloved man in china , " according to schretzmann . a new lease of life far from ending up on the scrap heap of employment once the retirement threshold has been crossed , german pensioners are continuing to bring their skills to the world and are gaining even more life experience as a result . " i do n't know anything about the area , " ulrich von hohmeier says before jetting off to his next mission in the northwest chinese province of xin jiang .
" i think it 's a really remote place but i 'm very excited . " hardly the response one would expect from a man who should , by society 's expectations , be enjoying a life of pipe and slippers . bastian hartig -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de generation gap , writ large advances in in vitro fertilization mean that women are able to bear children at increasingly advanced ages .

the glum faces of the governing ump and opposition socialists - who all backed the treaty - were in stark contrast to the street celebrations of the motley " no " campaign .
the alliance was an unlikely group of the far left , the far right and rebel socialists .
their supporters of all ages joined together in jubilation at place de la bastille , the scene of an earlier french revolt .
their impromptu street party was only slightly dampened by the rain .
" this is a message to europe , " said one middle-aged man as he toasted the " no " campaigners ' victory with a bottle of red wine .
" in 1789 we were the first country to remove our royalty , so maybe it 's the beginning of the new europe , beginning today in france . "
the woman standing next to him agreed : " i hope this will be a the start of a new project for a more social europe . "
grim leader others here insisted this was not a vote against europe . "
you have in the course of these debates expressed your worries " jacques chirac transcript : chirac 's address in quotes : european reaction uk ' must reflect on poll ' " it was a pro-european no , " said one young man .
" we are not against europe - we just want a different kind of europe . "
but will the treaty now be renegotiated , as no campaigners hope ?
president jacques chirac appeared to suggest not .
he was grim-faced as he addressed his rebellious nation from the elysee palace .
he said he respected the french people 's decision , but warned them that it would make it far harder to defend french interests in europe .
yet this result was as much a rejection of president chirac and the french political elite as a rejection of the treaty itself .
there is anger in france over 10 % unemployment and a stagnant economy , while many worry that europe is simply too big and no longer built in france 's image .
the " no " campaigners ' message convinced many that the treaty would enshrine an " ultra-liberal " economic approach which would bring about far harsher competition between eu nations , with french jobs migrating to cheaper eastern european workers .
likewise , fears over turkish entry to the eu - though not part of the constitution - became enmeshed in the passionate debate about the treaty .
the argument more often focused on france than europe , a debate refracted through a mood of national pessimism and gloom about its economic prospects , and the belief that its much-cherished social model is now under threat .
the fact that former french president valery giscard d 'estaing headed the committee that drafted the treaty made little difference in the end .
' disappointed ' last night 's rejection of the constitution was also a bitter defeat for those other backers of the " yes " vote - france 's opposition socialists . "
i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future " socialist activist supporters were left drowning their sorrows at the party headquarters last night .
" i am so disappointed in the french people , " said one young party activist .
" i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future .
" it is a shame for france and for the rest of europe . "
president chirac said that the rest of europe should continue to ratify the constitution - though some wonder if that is still a viable proposition in the face of such a rejection from one of europe 's founding nations .
so why did french voters at polling stations across the country so roundly ignore the arguments of the " yes " campaigners - who were backed by brussels , all the main french political parties and most of the french media ?
political jockeying political analyst dominique moisi says there were three main reasons .
" the people are saying ' no ' to chirac , they are expressing their fear and despair at the high level of unemployment in france , and they are expressing their reservations about europe vis-a-vis enlargement .
" so it is the political , economic and european dimensions which have led to this result . "
so has the french political elite been humbled - and will it finally listen to its people , who have delivered an unmistakeable message ?
mr chirac has already said he will not resign - though it is widely expected that his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin could be the scapegoat for this latest government defeat .
political jockeying for that job has already begun .
the president of the governing ump , nicolas sarkozy , who has made no secret of his presidential ambitions , was quick to say the government must heed the people .
" we need to listen to what the french have said .
by saying ' no ' , the french are calling on us to call things into question deeply , rapidly , vigorously .
" the french are urging us to put an end to our failure to act , to our over-cautiousness , or quite simply to our habits , to get the country moving and to put it back into motion without delay . "
the blood-letting at the french socialist party will also start on monday , with questions over mr hollande 's leadership , and the actions of the rebel socialists , led by former french prime minister laurent fabius and mp henri emmanuelli .
but what of the constitution itself ?
the suspicion in france among the " no " campaigners is that it could be put to the french people once again - perhaps next year - so that next time they come up with the answer their political masters wanted the first time around .

the glum faces of the governing ump and opposition socialists - who all backed the treaty - were in stark contrast to the street celebrations of the motley " no " campaign .
the alliance was an unlikely group of the far left , the far right and rebel socialists .
their supporters of all ages joined together in jubilation at place de la bastille , the scene of an earlier french revolt .
their impromptu street party was only slightly dampened by the rain .
" this is a message to europe , " said one middle-aged man as he toasted the " no " campaigners ' victory with a bottle of red wine .
" in 1789 we were the first country to remove our royalty , so maybe it 's the beginning of the new europe , beginning today in france . "
the woman standing next to him agreed : " i hope this will be a the start of a new project for a more social europe . "
grim leader others here insisted this was not a vote against europe .
you have in the course of these debates expressed your worries jacques chirac transcript : chirac 's address in quotes : european reaction uk ' must reflect on poll ' " it was a pro-european no , " said one young man .
" we are not against europe - we just want a different kind of europe . "
but will the treaty now be renegotiated , as no campaigners hope ?
president jacques chirac appeared to suggest not .
he was grim-faced as he addressed his rebellious nation from the elysee palace .
he said he respected the french people 's decision , but warned them that it would make it far harder to defend french interests in europe .
yet this result was as much a rejection of president chirac and the french political elite as a rejection of the treaty itself .
there is anger in france over 10 % unemployment and a stagnant economy , while many worry that europe is simply too big and no longer built in france 's image .
the " no " campaigners ' message convinced many that the treaty would enshrine an " ultra-liberal " economic approach which would bring about far harsher competition between eu nations , with french jobs migrating to cheaper eastern european workers .
likewise , fears over turkish entry to the eu - though not part of the constitution - became enmeshed in the passionate debate about the treaty .
the argument more often focused on france than europe , a debate refracted through a mood of national pessimism and gloom about its economic prospects , and the belief that its much-cherished social model is now under threat .
the fact that former french president valery giscard d 'estaing headed the committee that drafted the treaty made little difference in the end .
' disappointed ' last night 's rejection of the constitution was also a bitter defeat for those other backers of the " yes " vote - france 's opposition socialists .
i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future socialist activist supporters were left drowning their sorrows at the party headquarters last night .
" i am so disappointed in the french people , " said one young party activist .
" i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future .
" it is a shame for france and for the rest of europe . "
president chirac said that the rest of europe should continue to ratify the constitution - though some wonder if that is still a viable proposition in the face of such a rejection from one of europe 's founding nations .
so why did french voters at polling stations across the country so roundly ignore the arguments of the " yes " campaigners - who were backed by brussels , all the main french political parties and most of the french media ?
political jockeying political analyst dominique moisi says there were three main reasons .
" the people are saying ' no ' to chirac , they are expressing their fear and despair at the high level of unemployment in france , and they are expressing their reservations about europe vis-a-vis enlargement .
" so it is the political , economic and european dimensions which have led to this result . "
so has the french political elite been humbled - and will it finally listen to its people , who have delivered an unmistakeable message ?
mr chirac has already said he will not resign - though it is widely expected that his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin could be the scapegoat for this latest government defeat .
political jockeying for that job has already begun .
the president of the governing ump , nicolas sarkozy , who has made no secret of his presidential ambitions , was quick to say the government must heed the people .
" we need to listen to what the french have said .
by saying ' no ' , the french are calling on us to call things into question deeply , rapidly , vigorously .
" the french are urging us to put an end to our failure to act , to our over-cautiousness , or quite simply to our habits , to get the country moving and to put it back into motion without delay . "
the blood-letting at the french socialist party will also start on monday , with questions over mr hollande 's leadership , and the actions of the rebel socialists , led by former french prime minister laurent fabius and mp henri emmanuelli .

likewise , fears over turkish entry to the eu - though not part of the constitution - became enmeshed in the passionate debate about the treaty .
the argument more often focused on france than europe , a debate refracted through a mood of national pessimism and gloom about its economic prospects , and the belief that its much-cherished social model is now under threat .
the fact that former french president valery giscard d 'estaing headed the committee that drafted the treaty made little difference in the end .
' disappointed ' last night 's rejection of the constitution was also a bitter defeat for those other backers of the " yes " vote - france 's opposition socialists .
i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future socialist activist supporters were left drowning their sorrows at the party headquarters last night .
" i am so disappointed in the french people , " said one young party activist .
" i shall probably go home to bed and cry - and then get up in the morning to find out how we face the future .
" it is a shame for france and for the rest of europe . "
president chirac said that the rest of europe should continue to ratify the constitution - though some wonder if that is still a viable proposition in the face of such a rejection from one of europe 's founding nations .
so why did french voters at polling stations across the country so roundly ignore the arguments of the " yes " campaigners - who were backed by brussels , all the main french political parties and most of the french media ?
political jockeying political analyst dominique moisi says there were three main reasons .
" the people are saying ' no ' to chirac , they are expressing their fear and despair at the high level of unemployment in france , and they are expressing their reservations about europe vis-a-vis enlargement .
" so it is the political , economic and european dimensions which have led to this result . "
so has the french political elite been humbled - and will it finally listen to its people , who have delivered an unmistakeable message ?
mr chirac has already said he will not resign - though it is widely expected that his unpopular prime minister jean-pierre raffarin could be the scapegoat for this latest government defeat .
political jockeying for that job has already begun .
the president of the governing ump , nicolas sarkozy , who has made no secret of his presidential ambitions , was quick to say the government must heed the people .
" we need to listen to what the french have said .
by saying ' no ' , the french are calling on us to call things into question deeply , rapidly , vigorously .
" the french are urging us to put an end to our failure to act , to our over-cautiousness , or quite simply to our habits , to get the country moving and to put it back into motion without delay . "
the blood-letting at the french socialist party will also start on monday , with questions over mr hollande 's leadership , and the actions of the rebel socialists , led by former french prime minister laurent fabius and mp henri emmanuelli .
but what of the constitution itself ?
the suspicion in france among the " no " campaigners is that it could be put to the french people once again - perhaps next year - so that next time they come up with the answer their political masters wanted the first time around .

the glum faces of the governing ump and opposition socialists - who all backed the treaty - were in stark contrast to the street celebrations of the motley " no " campaign .
the alliance was an unlikely group of the far left , the far right and rebel socialists .
their supporters of all ages joined together in jubilation at place de la bastille , the scene of an earlier french revolt .
their impromptu street party was only slightly dampened by the rain .
" this is a message to europe , " said one middle-aged man as he toasted the " no " campaigners ' victory with a bottle of red wine .
" in 1789 we were the first country to remove our royalty , so maybe it 's the beginning of the new europe , beginning today in france . "
the woman standing next to him agreed : " i hope this will be a the start of a new project for a more social europe . "
grim leader others here insisted this was not a vote against europe .
you have in the course of these debates expressed your worries jacques chirac transcript : chirac 's address in quotes : european reaction uk ' must reflect on poll ' " it was a pro-european no , " said one young man .
" we are not against europe - we just want a different kind of europe . "
but will the treaty now be renegotiated , as no campaigners hope ?
president jacques chirac appeared to suggest not .
he was grim-faced as he addressed his rebellious nation from the elysee palace .
he said he respected the french people 's decision , but warned them that it would make it far harder to defend french interests in europe .
yet this result was as much a rejection of president chirac and the french political elite as a rejection of the treaty itself .
there is anger in france over 10 % unemployment and a stagnant economy , while many worry that europe is simply too big and no longer built in france 's image .
the " no " campaigners ' message convinced many that the treaty would enshrine an " ultra-liberal " economic approach which would bring about far harsher competition between eu nations , with french jobs migrating to cheaper eastern european workers .

france french president jacques chirac : " you have rejected the european constitution by a majority .
it is your sovereign decision and i take note of it .
" nevertheless , our ambitions and interests are profoundly linked to europe .
" but let 's not be mistaken .
the decision of france inevitably creates a difficult context for the defence of our interests in europe . "
president of the ruling ump party , nicolas sarkozy -lrb- who campaigned for a " yes " vote -rrb- : " by saying ' no ' , the french are calling on us to act quickly and vigorously to change the status quo .
" they are putting pressure on us to bring to an end the inertia and the nervousness ... to move the country forward as fast as possible .
" we need to decide on a programme of action that is innovating , brave and ambitious .
there has to be a major turnaround in our economic and social policy .
there is no reason why this can not happen . "
french foreign minister michel barnier : rejection of treaty is " a real disappointment " .
leading french eurosceptic philippe de villiers : " we are this evening confronted with a major political crisis .
only the president can resolve it - in two ways , i leave him the choice .
either he resigns , given that he heavily involved himself in the campaign , or he dissolves the national assembly . "
uk uk foreign secretary jack straw : " this raises profound questions for all of us about the direction of europe ...
what we want now is a period of reflection . "
foreign affairs spokesman for uk 's opposition conservative party liam fox : " it sounds like the people of france have done a favour to all the rest of the people of europe .
they 've decided that they want reform , they 've decided that they want politicians to think again .
" they 've shown that there 's too big a gap now between the ruling classes in europe and the citizens of europe . "
european union european commission president jose manuel barroso : " it 's a very serious problem , we ca n't talk about business as usual ...
we must transform this difficult moment into an opportunity for europe .
we should try together to put europe back on track . "
european commission vice-president guenter verheugen : -lrb- on prospects of the netherlands backing the treaty in a referendum on wednesday -rrb- " to be honest , i am not especially hopeful .
france has not sent an encouraging signal to the netherlands . "
chairman of the right-wing epp-ed group in the european parliament , hans-gert poettering : " the european union has managed already many crises and was almost always able to reach agreement in the end .
" we must hope now that a pragmatic management of the crisis will also lead to a solution in this case . "
leader of the socialist group in the european parliament martin schulz : " the battle goes on .
the ratification process must continue because all countries must have the opportunity to express their view . "
luxembourg european union president and luxembourg prime minister jean jean-claude juncker : " it is a european debate .
the ratification procedure must be pursued in other countries . "
germany german chancellor gerhard schroeder : " the referendum result is a blow for the constitutional process , but not the end of it .

" the netherlands has a lot to gain from this constitutional treaty .
it is in the interest of europe and of our own country . "
spain spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero : " the result of the referendum in france is not good news but it is not a catastrophe .

austria austrian far-right politician joerg haider : " the bureaucrats in brussels have miscalculated ...

i am convinced it will be possible to do something else , with a few adaptations . "
italy former european commission president and former italian prime minister romano prodi : " if this is the result , i am extremely disappointed .

but all 25 countries must be given the opportunity to give their opinion .
this means we must let the danish people give their opinion in a referendum on 27 september . "
czech republic czech prime minister jiri paroubek : " i 've already said before that i thought it was a mistake to expect all 25 states of the eu to ratify the constitution in a first round .
" for me , the french result is not a surprise , but it is regrettable how it happened . "
slovenia slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel : " the eu project will advance at a slower pace , it will be difficult to talk about expansion .
but inside the eu we will live as we did so far .
this is not the end of the world . "
estonia prime minister andrus ansip : " i am not happy about it .
the constitution is good for estonia and good for europe .

bbc radio wales ' eye on wales reports the fears of many for the future of the grassroots game .
one administrator said there was such a shortage that the welsh league and the cymru alliance could be without referees .
eye on wales is broadcast on radio wales at 1800bst on monday .
the programme says officials are abused by both players and supporters , and there are increasing problems with younger players and their parents .
if we allow the odd idiot on the park who 's going to cause trouble to win , then we all may as well wrap up and go home roger gifford , football association of wales referee george ridgeway tells the programme : " a lot of parents cause problems at mini-football games .
they can use verbal threatening behaviour which can be very frightening at times . "
the north wales coast football association has told its referees next season to inform it immediately of any assaults and the player will be suspended until the referee 's report has been received .
the association 's trevor lloyd-hughes said there were only 21 referees available for three north wales leagues , when 46 were needed .
he said the authorities had to be stronger with players , and fine them or hand out more suspensions .
man united 's wayne rooney is accused of influencing bad behaviour " but we are also governed by the welsh fa , -lrb- and -rrb- i think they are also realising there is a problem and hopefully we can work together , " said mr lloyd-hughes .
roger gifford , national referees ' officer for the football association of wales , said recruitment was a serious problem with an acute shortage at all levels .
mr gifford said the biggest problem was the lack of discipline , but described the number of on-field assaults as " minuscule " in relation to the number of games .
it 's part of the rock star syndrome that you behave badly head teacher chris howard on premiership players " if we allow the odd idiot on the park who 's going to cause trouble to win , then we all may as well wrap up and go home , " said mr gifford .
" i 'll go as far as to say that -lrb- with -rrb- the current trend of recruitment if it continues , levels three , two and one in the pyramid and particularly one and two which is the welsh league in the south and the cymru alliance in the north will not have referees and that will be a very sad day indeed . "
the programme also hears from players and referees who had been assaulted on the field .
broken jaw one , ronan gregory , was playing for his company football team , the principality building society , last year in a game when the referee failed to turn up .
his jaw was broken by an opponent who was " red with rage " .
mr gregory spent several days in hospital and was off work for six weeks , while his attacker was jailed for eight months .
" justice was done , " said mr gregory .
" you ca n't get away with that kind of thing .
if you do it on the street you will be punished very similarly .
wayne davies , of ammanford , has given up refereeing after a player he sent off during a local league game in llanelli verbally abused him and spat in his face .
mr davies abandoned the game , and the player was banned for two years .
mr davies said he was not surprised that people did not want to referee .
" you ask ex-players who are coming towards their last days .
-lrb- they say -rrb- i could n't put up with what you 're putting up with .
" up until this incident i was loving it .
you have ups and downs with players and clubs ... but it is getting ott .
chris howard , head teacher of lewis school in pengam , south wales , has criticised the " aggressive obscenities " used by manchester united and england star wayne rooney against the referee in a game against arsenal , which he believes rub off on younger players .
" when watching that game i did think what chance have we got next day if youngsters in school behave in the same way , " he told the programme .
" what worries me particularly is that in premiership it 's become commonplace for very aggressive challenge of the referee and linesmen .
people see authority figures being abused in that context and i 'm sure that over time that kind of thing does rub off .

bbc radio wales ' eye on wales reports the fears of many for the future of the grassroots game .
one administrator said there was such a shortage that the welsh league and the cymru alliance could be without referees .
eye on wales is broadcast on radio wales at 1800bst on monday .
the programme says officials are abused by both players and supporters , and there are increasing problems with younger players and their parents .
if we allow the odd idiot on the park who 's going to cause trouble to win , then we all may as well wrap up and go home roger gifford , football association of wales referee george ridgeway tells the programme : " a lot of parents cause problems at mini-football games .
they can use verbal threatening behaviour which can be very frightening at times . "
the north wales coast football association has told its referees next season to inform it immediately of any assaults and the player will be suspended until the referee 's report has been received .
the association 's trevor lloyd-hughes said there were only 21 referees available for three north wales leagues , when 46 were needed .
he said the authorities had to be stronger with players , and fine them or hand out more suspensions .
man united 's wayne rooney is accused of influencing bad behaviour " but we are also governed by the welsh fa , -lrb- and -rrb- i think they are also realising there is a problem and hopefully we can work together , " said mr lloyd-hughes .
roger gifford , national referees ' officer for the football association of wales , said recruitment was a serious problem with an acute shortage at all levels .
mr gifford said the biggest problem was the lack of discipline , but described the number of on-field assaults as " minuscule " in relation to the number of games .
it 's part of the rock star syndrome that you behave badly head teacher chris howard on premiership players " if we allow the odd idiot on the park who 's going to cause trouble to win , then we all may as well wrap up and go home , " said mr gifford .
" i 'll go as far as to say that -lrb- with -rrb- the current trend of recruitment if it continues , levels three , two and one in the pyramid and particularly one and two which is the welsh league in the south and the cymru alliance in the north will not have referees and that will be a very sad day indeed . "
the programme also hears from players and referees who had been assaulted on the field .
broken jaw one , ronan gregory , was playing for his company football team , the principality building society , last year in a game when the referee failed to turn up .
his jaw was broken by an opponent who was " red with rage " .
mr gregory spent several days in hospital and was off work for six weeks , while his attacker was jailed for eight months .
" justice was done , " said mr gregory .
" you ca n't get away with that kind of thing .
if you do it on the street you will be punished very similarly .
wayne davies , of ammanford , has given up refereeing after a player he sent off during a local league game in llanelli verbally abused him and spat in his face .
mr davies abandoned the game , and the player was banned for two years .
mr davies said he was not surprised that people did not want to referee .
" you ask ex-players who are coming towards their last days .
-lrb- they say -rrb- i could n't put up with what you 're putting up with .
" up until this incident i was loving it .
you have ups and downs with players and clubs ... but it is getting ott .
chris howard , head teacher of lewis school in pengam , south wales , has criticised the " aggressive obscenities " used by manchester united and england star wayne rooney against the referee in a game against arsenal , which he believes rub off on younger players .
" when watching that game i did think what chance have we got next day if youngsters in school behave in the same way , " he told the programme .
" what worries me particularly is that in premiership it 's become commonplace for very aggressive challenge of the referee and linesmen .
people see authority figures being abused in that context and i 'm sure that over time that kind of thing does rub off .
" however , in defence of poor young wayne rooney - who i have to say was much better behaved in the game i last saw him play - he is the product of his generation , not the cause of these problems .
" it 's part of the rock star syndrome that you behave badly . "

france has been at the heart of the post-war construction of europe .
it has been the mover and shaker .
now it has certainly done a bit of shaking .
the original agreement by france and germany to pool the raw materials of war , iron and steel , was the idea of far-sighted frenchmen like jean monnet and robert schuman .

the commission spokesman spoke only in french and an attempt by the many non-european correspondents to get at least a translation into english was blocked on the grounds that this would " discriminate " against other languages .

european heads of state and government will creep to brussels on 16 june to try to pick up the pieces .

there is no clear way forward .

it is possible that some bits of the constitution could be picked out and put together in a modest bundle - a more permanent presidency for example , rather than the everyone gets a turn principle which operates at the moment .

by megan lane bbc news magazine as befits the me-me-me age we live in , those who volunteer can get as much out of giving their time as those they are helping .
for volunteering can be good for the cv , the waistline - even the love life .
fitter .
happier .
more productive .
better work / life balance .
credit at -lrb- moral -rrb- bank .
with apologies to radiohead , giving time to good causes is essentially a selfish business .
rare is the charity that asks for volunteers simply by appealing to people 's altruistic nature .
some work with businesses so time given can be counted towards an employee 's work hours .
thus projects such as repainting village halls or clearing scrubland have been rebranded as team-building sessions .
others offer qualifications with a heavy practical component , pitch physical labour as an alternative to the gym , or attract volunteers to scenic locales with working holidays .
paradoxical it may sound , but the institute for volunteering research has even looked into whether people should be paid for their time -lrb- the answer was no , but costs incurred , such as travel and childcare , could be reimbursed -rrb- .
ads to recruit volunteers " do something for others and gain practical skills " " live with people from around the world -lrb- and have a laugh -rrb- " " improve your employability while making a real difference to people 's lives " source : what 's it all about by julian baggini nor do volunteers simply seek to contribute to society - although that is a key motivation .
students and jobseekers keen to get into the course or workplace of their choice hope voluntary work will help them stand out from the crowd .
this chance to gain experience - to develop personally and professionally - is high on the wish-list of young people , according to the institute 's study into how to get them to give their time .
claire , a 19-year-old who supports a fellow student with cerebral palsy at university , says not only does she get a sense of achievement from helping another , " the skills i have learnt - such as effective communication and teamwork - will be useful for any kind of career " .
have fun , meet new people for refugees and other new arrivals , getting involved is a good way to gain language skills , self-esteem and a stake in the community .
but there 's a cultural barrier in some communities that volunteering is n't worth it as it 's unpaid , says saima ayez , the volunteer coordinator at derby 's asian advisory service .
but the success of immigrants such as vandanna bhanot , from india , is helping to change attitudes .
she arrived in derby with an msc in computer sciences but no experience of office protocol in the uk .
" now i write in my cv that i have experience of working in the uk , through volunteering at the asian advisory service , " she says .
would like to meet and it has long been an open secret in the volunteering community that giving up your time to do something you 're passionate about can lead to love .
it is one of the beautiful compensations of life , that no man can sincerely help another without helping himself ralph waldo emerson send us your experiences what 's more recent are the statistics to back this up .
in a community service volunteers -lrb- csv -rrb- survey last year , young and old alike - one in five 18 to 24-year-olds , and 8 % of over-65s - said volunteering had improved their sex lives , especially those who offered their professional skills , or got involved in conservation or heritage work .
mukta das is a vigorous advocate of the philosophy , and has a long-term relationship to prove her point .
" volunteering is what speed-dating promises but never fulfils - a way of seeing a lot of truth about someone you 've just met in a short a time as possible , " says mukta , who met her partner ian in 2001 while helping on make a difference day .
all her previous relationships started at the bar , she says .
this , her longest so far , " is the only one which started out sober and during day-light hours . "
little wonder that advice to lonely hearts suggests volunteering as a way to meet like-minded individuals .
but it 's not only singles whose love-lives get a fillip .
" you get out there , meet people , get some exercise , work towards a common goal , feel good about what you 're doing .
all that energy and self-esteem has got to make a difference to your sex life , " says the csv 's esther freeman .
" the typical date apparently costs £ 200 ; well , with volunteering , you get it all for free . "
selfish pursuit ?
the same poll found that nearly half of volunteers enjoyed improved health and fitness , a quarter had lost weight - especially those working with children or doing conservation projects - and two-thirds felt less stressed .
who volunteers ?
over half the population volunteers sport and recreation accounts for a quarter of all volunteering more are volunteering through employer-sponsored schemes in 2003 , the figure reached 1.5m in england and wales bbc ican : find volunteering opportunities near you so businesses have cottoned on that this is a way to keep the workforce happy and productive - and it does n't do their community profile any harm at all .
staff , too , get a break in the daily grind and the chance to develop and demonstrate valued " soft skills " such as initiative and decision-making .
csv is currently conducting another survey , this time on whether volunteering improves recruitment , retention , productivity , morale and absenteeism .
workers and managers are being polled separately , and the final results will compare their opinions .
" we want to know if it actually makes a difference in the workplace , or if volunteering is seen as something dreamed up in an hr department because it sounds good , " says ms freeman .
not only are business-sponsored placements on the up , the government is ploughing money into the sector , including £ 150m earmarked to recruit one million young volunteers in the latest budget .
so the push is on to make volunteering as attractive to as many people as possible .
should we worry if volunteering also helps the helper ?
julian baggini , editor of the philosophers ' magazine and author of what 's it all about , thinks not .
" good deeds that benefit all parties involved are preferable to those that only benefit one .
the more people who benefit , the more the act achieves its aim of making the world a better place . "

for volunteering can be good for the cv , the waistline - even the love life .
fitter .
happier .
more productive .
better work / life balance .

with apologies to radiohead , giving time to good causes is essentially a selfish business .
rare is the charity that asks for volunteers simply by appealing to people 's altruistic nature .
some work with businesses so time given can be counted towards an employee 's work hours .
thus projects such as repainting village halls or clearing scrubland have been rebranded as team-building sessions .
others offer qualifications with a heavy practical component , pitch physical labour as an alternative to the gym , or attract volunteers to scenic locales with working holidays .
paradoxical it may sound , but the institute for volunteering research has even looked into whether people should be paid for their time -lrb- the answer was no , but costs incurred , such as travel and childcare , could be reimbursed -rrb- .
ads to recruit volunteers " do something for others and gain practical skills " " live with people from around the world -lrb- and have a laugh -rrb- " " improve your employability while making a real difference to people 's lives " source : what 's it all about by julian baggini nor do volunteers simply seek to contribute to society - although that is a key motivation .
students and jobseekers keen to get into the course or workplace of their choice hope voluntary work will help them stand out from the crowd .
this chance to gain experience - to develop personally and professionally - is high on the wish-list of young people , according to the institute 's study into how to get them to give their time .
claire , a 19-year-old who supports a fellow student with cerebral palsy at university , says not only does she get a sense of achievement from helping another , " the skills i have learnt - such as effective communication and teamwork - will be useful for any kind of career " .
have fun , meet new people for refugees and other new arrivals , getting involved is a good way to gain language skills , self-esteem and a stake in the community .
but there 's a cultural barrier in some communities that volunteering is n't worth it as it 's unpaid , says saima ayez , the volunteer coordinator at derby 's asian advisory service .
but the success of immigrants such as vandanna bhanot , from india , is helping to change attitudes .
she arrived in derby with an msc in computer sciences but no experience of office protocol in the uk .
" now i write in my cv that i have experience of working in the uk , through volunteering at the asian advisory service , " she says .
would like to meet and it has long been an open secret in the volunteering community that giving up your time to do something you 're passionate about can lead to love .
it is one of the beautiful compensations of life , that no man can sincerely help another without helping himself ralph waldo emerson send us your experiences what 's more recent are the statistics to back this up .
in a community service volunteers -lrb- csv -rrb- survey last year , young and old alike - one in five 18 to 24-year-olds , and 8 % of over-65s - said volunteering had improved their sex lives , especially those who offered their professional skills , or got involved in conservation or heritage work .
mukta das is a vigorous advocate of the philosophy , and has a long-term relationship to prove her point .
" volunteering is what speed-dating promises but never fulfils - a way of seeing a lot of truth about someone you 've just met in a short a time as possible , " says mukta , who met her partner ian in 2001 while helping on make a difference day .
all her previous relationships started at the bar , she says .
this , her longest so far , " is the only one which started out sober and during day-light hours . "
little wonder that advice to lonely hearts suggests volunteering as a way to meet like-minded individuals .
but it 's not only singles whose love-lives get a fillip .
" you get out there , meet people , get some exercise , work towards a common goal , feel good about what you 're doing .
all that energy and self-esteem has got to make a difference to your sex life , " says the csv 's esther freeman .
" the typical date apparently costs £ 200 ; well , with volunteering , you get it all for free . "
selfish pursuit ?
the same poll found that nearly half of volunteers enjoyed improved health and fitness , a quarter had lost weight - especially those working with children or doing conservation projects - and two-thirds felt less stressed .
who volunteers ?
over half the population volunteers sport and recreation accounts for a quarter of all volunteering more are volunteering through employer-sponsored schemes in 2003 , the figure reached 1.5m in england and wales bbc ican : find volunteering opportunities near you so businesses have cottoned on that this is a way to keep the workforce happy and productive - and it does n't do their community profile any harm at all .
staff , too , get a break in the daily grind and the chance to develop and demonstrate valued " soft skills " such as initiative and decision-making .
csv is currently conducting another survey , this time on whether volunteering improves recruitment , retention , productivity , morale and absenteeism .
workers and managers are being polled separately , and the final results will compare their opinions .
" we want to know if it actually makes a difference in the workplace , or if volunteering is seen as something dreamed up in an hr department because it sounds good , " says ms freeman .
not only are business-sponsored placements on the up , the government is ploughing money into the sector , including £ 150m earmarked to recruit one million young volunteers in the latest budget .
so the push is on to make volunteering as attractive to as many people as possible .
should we worry if volunteering also helps the helper ?
julian baggini , editor of the philosophers ' magazine and author of what 's it all about , thinks not .
" good deeds that benefit all parties involved are preferable to those that only benefit one .
the more people who benefit , the more the act achieves its aim of making the world a better place . "

almost 55 % of people voted " no " , with 45 % in favour .
turnout was high , at about 70 % .
the vote could deal a fatal blow to the eu constitution , which needs to be ratified by all 25 member states .
president jacques chirac accepted the voters ' " sovereign decision " , but said it created " a difficult context for the defence of our interests in europe " .
the french leader had campaigned hard for a " yes " vote .
the bbc 's caroline wyatt in paris says the rejection by one of the eu 's founding members is a political earthquake , sending reverberations right across europe .
winners and losers european commission president jose manuel barroso described the french rejection as " a very serious problem , " but insisted : " we can not say that the treaty is dead . "
but the bbc 's world affairs analyst paul reynolds says there is no plan b for the eu and no clear way forward , with moves towards further integration now in doubt . "
you have in the course of these debates expressed your worries " jacques chirac transcript : chirac 's address in quotes : european reaction uk ' must reflect on poll ' in his televised address , mr chirac said voters had registered their frustrations .
he said he would take a decision on the future of his centre-right government " in the coming days " , hinting at a possible reshuffle .
late on sunday jubilant " no " supporters gathered at the place de la bastille in paris - where the french revolution began - chanting " we won " and sounding horns .
those who rejected the treaty came from across the political spectrum , including communists , dissident socialists and right-wing parties .
one of the leading right-wing opponents of the treaty , philippe de villiers , said : " europe has to be rebuilt .
the constitution is no more . "
he urged mr chirac either to stand down or dissolve parliament .
the leader of opposition socialist party francois hollande , from the " yes " campaign , voiced " regret " over the result , but blamed prime minister jean-pierre raffarin .
" the rejection of this treaty is above all the rejection of the government , " he said .
referendum season foreign minister michel barnier said the vote was a " real disappointment " - but urged other eu countries to go ahead with their own votes .
already ratified treaty austria germany greece hungary italy lithuania slovakia slovenia spain where eu members stand member states can ratify the document through a referendum or by parliamentary vote .
so far nine countries have formally endorsed it .
eight national referendums are still to come , including one in the netherlands on wednesday , where the " no " side is leading the opinion polls .
prime minister jan peter balkenende called on his fellow dutch to approve the treaty despite france 's rejection .
" there is all the more reason to say ' yes ' so that some progress can be recorded , " he said .
in the uk , foreign secretary jack straw said the result raised " profound questions " about the direction of europe .
the constitution was finalised last year after long negotiations among eu governments .
its aim is to streamline eu institutions following the admission of 10 new members last year .
