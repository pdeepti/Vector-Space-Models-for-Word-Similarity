program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .

they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .
while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities .

25 , 2005 -rrb- germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .
the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

the big-scoring bavarians are already topping the league so far , four points ahead of the rest . hoping to add some fizz to a much familiar bayern-dominated soccer season , the bitburg brewery realized it needed to offer some additional incentive for the other teams to topple the heavyweights .

" we 've nothing against bayern but there must be some tension , " henle said . the first team to get a chance to fill up its thirsty fans is the second-placed hamburg hsv on saturday .
the hsv will need even more motivation than the others : no team has lost more often to bayern munich - 50 of 80 games . if hsv ca n't clinch the beer for their fans tomorrow , the liters will climb - by 1,000 with every match until the prize is won - as bayern takes on wolfsburg , schalke , and duisburg . however long it takes , germany 's soccer fans will be rewarded for their patience ! dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .

further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .
while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away .

dw-world spoke with him about his work , his ties to germany and his political activities .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 secret police in germany 's parliament ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birthler said at least seven new parliamentarians should be checked germany 's federal commissioner for the files of the former east german secret police has called for an investigation of new parliamentarians to check whether they worked for the organization . marianne birthler already said that seven new members of parliament , all of the new left party , are known former members of the stasi , the former east german secret police .
birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .

" we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .

the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .

in the central state of hesse , the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rose by 2.2 percent on a 12-month basis in september , sharply faster than the 1.6 percent recorded in august .
the regional statistics office in wiesbaden attributed the pick-up to the continued rise in prices for oil products .
excluding oil , cpi would have risen by just 1.3 percent year-on-year , the statisticians calculated .
regional cost of living data from six so-called indicator states - baden-württemberg , bavaria , brandenburg , hesse , north rhine-westphalia and saxony - are used to calculate preliminary pan-german inflation . hesse was the first state to publish september cpi . dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

the current four member-strong board would be expanded to five , adding a chief risk officer , the newspaper quoted senior deutsche bank figures as saying .
the trigger will be the retirement of the bank 's chief administrative officer , tessen von heydebrec , next year .
von heydebreck 's replacement could be joined by a second new board member , with insiders tipping hugo banziger , head of credit and operational risk , as the favorite , the paper reported . deutsche bank halved the size of its executive board when josef ackermann became chief executive in 2002 , sparking criticism among corporate governance experts . dw-world.de german execs criticized for salary jumps board members of the top thirty companies listed in germany 's blue-chip dax index netted an average 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in annual salaries last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .
" education is therefore a central aspect of our work . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left party leader wins privacy case a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .

further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

18 producing no clear winner , political parties are scrambling to hold talks to form a future government .
among the possible constellations , the so-called " grand coalition " between the two main parties , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is seen as a serious option .
the others include an alliance between the cdu , their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens , chancellor gerhard schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government for the past seven years .
the third likely combination includes the spd , the fdp and the greens .
whichever constellation finally comes to power , it will face battleground areas like labor market reform , as well as possible points of compromise like foreign policy .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

" she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

" we 've nothing against bayern but there must be some tension , " henle said . the first team to get a chance to fill up its thirsty fans is the second-placed hamburg hsv on saturday .
the hsv will need even more motivation than the others : no team has lost more often to bayern munich - 50 of 80 games . if hsv ca n't clinch the beer for their fans tomorrow , the liters will climb - by 1,000 with every match until the prize is won - as bayern takes on wolfsburg , schalke , and duisburg . however long it takes , germany 's soccer fans will be rewarded for their patience ! dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 left party not yet out of the power game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could end up with an influential role in german politics the left party was the only contender in the german polls who could claim a full victory , winning 8.7 percent of votes in their first bid for power .
they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .

until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .

the big-scoring bavarians are already topping the league so far , four points ahead of the rest . hoping to add some fizz to a much familiar bayern-dominated soccer season , the bitburg brewery realized it needed to offer some additional incentive for the other teams to topple the heavyweights .

" we 've nothing against bayern but there must be some tension , " henle said . the first team to get a chance to fill up its thirsty fans is the second-placed hamburg hsv on saturday .
the hsv will need even more motivation than the others : no team has lost more often to bayern munich - 50 of 80 games . if hsv ca n't clinch the beer for their fans tomorrow , the liters will climb - by 1,000 with every match until the prize is won - as bayern takes on wolfsburg , schalke , and duisburg . however long it takes , germany 's soccer fans will be rewarded for their patience ! dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .
" education is therefore a central aspect of our work . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left party leader wins privacy case a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .

a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .

the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .

further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

among the possible constellations , the so-called " grand coalition " between the two main parties , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is seen as a serious option .
the others include an alliance between the cdu , their preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal fdp and the greens , chancellor gerhard schröder 's junior coalition partner in the government for the past seven years .
the third likely combination includes the spd , the fdp and the greens .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 adopting a new attitude towards children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are there fewer children to adopt , or fewer adults willing to be parents ?
the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .

they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 left party not yet out of the power game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could end up with an influential role in german politics the left party was the only contender in the german polls who could claim a full victory , winning 8.7 percent of votes in their first bid for power .
they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake .

that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .

the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .
reforms alone ca n't stimulate the economy . michael knigge interviewed avi primor -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 40 years of german-israeli diplomacy germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations on thursday .

the third likely combination includes the spd , the fdp and the greens .

they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

18 producing no clear winner , political parties are scrambling to hold talks to form a future government .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "

although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .

how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .

although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .
the neo-liberals also want to get rid of the eco-tax introduced by the red-green government on gas . foreign and domestic security there are few disagreements in this area .
in the security crackdown in the years after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks , the fdp and the greens have alternately served as the voice of reason : fighting against encroachment on civil rights and promoting a tolerant immigration policy .
the spd and the greens passed the country 's first immigration bill and their foreign policy has largely resonated with the fdp . the only point of disagreement is turkey - where the fdp has sided with the christian democrats against the red-green government 's push to let the predominantly muslim country join the european union . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica or traffic light ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2005 " germans should invest in the gaza strip " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primor : both germany and israeli should invest more in each other as germany and israel celebrate 40 years of diplomatic relations , dw-world spoke to former ambassador avi primor about the two countries ' business ties . avi primor , formerly israel 's ambassador to germany , is the president of the israeli-german chamber of commerce .
dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

dw-world spoke to him in berlin on the occasion of the annual german-israeli business day .
dw-world : how would you sum up 40 years of german-israeli business relations ? avi primor : the business relations were n't always very interesting .
there were times , at the very beginning , when the israelis did n't want to buy any german products at all .
our products did n't make it to germany because the quality was poor .
but because the relationship actually started with the reparations treaty - and the reparations treaty did n't mean that germany gave us cash , but instead machines , spare parts , train engines , ships and such things - the israelis gradually became accustomed to german industrial products .
after the end of the reparations treaty , in 1964 , the israelis simply continued to import industrial products from germany , so that germany has gradually became our largest trade partner - especially industrial trade - after the united states .
our exports to germany have never developed to the extent of our imports from germany , but it also increased . but there was another problem .
the germans have for various reasons practically never invested in israel .
there were businessmen who were avoided traveling to israel and investing there .
in view of the past , they may have been scared .
an additional reason is surely the political situation in the middle east and the insecurity in israel .
in the early 1990s that gradually changed , with the 1993 oslo accord .
there was still turbulence , but i would say that germany is today a well-balanced partner to israel and still the second most important one after the united states . if you look at the figures , things look quite rosy .
trade is booming , exports between the two countries in 2004 reached double-digit levels .
you must be satisfied . overall , i am satisfied .
however , i still think that one could do much more , particularly in terms of investments .
in the 1990s , above all during the time of the oslo accord between the israelis and palestinians , the germans became somewhat more daring .
they were less afraid and started to invest in israel .
unfortunately , that did n't always progress very well because of the intifada , the palestinian uprising .
i think that one could do much more and invest much more .
the israelis , too , could invest more in germany .
it 's true that there are businesspeople in israel who have invested in germany , especially in the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- german states , but there 's still a lot to do . the stagnant peace process in the middle east has for years been a constant problem for business ties .
how can german and israeli business contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict between the israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bulldozer destroys a house in the jewish settlement of morag in the southern gaza strip monday aug .
22 , 2005 .
israeli bulldozers began leveling homes in the evacuated gaza settlements sunday , reducing once-thriving villages within hours to refuse dumps and sealing the fate of jewish settlement in the coastal strip .
after the settlements in gaza are completely evacuated and knocked down , israel is to turn gaza over to palestinian control for the first time . -lrb- ap photo / kevin frayer -rrb- i think that we will have peace with the palestinians when the palestinians have better living conditions and do n't live in misery as they do today .
that also means investments .
for israel , it means making the occupation looser .
part of the occupation does n't exist anymore since we recently evacuated the gaza strip .
now we have to ensure that the people in the gaza strip can profit from peace and understand that peace is more advantageous for them than war and terror . that 's why people should invest in the gaza strip and that 's something germans and israelis could possibly do together .
with the germans so far feeling insecure in the gaza strip and not having the confidence to invest there , and the israelis being unwanted there , one could , for example , build industries along the border .
these industries would profit from palestinian workers - who are not only cheaper but also experienced workers because they worked in israeli industry in the past - as well as from the israeli infrastructure .
that could be interesting as a first step , since it would not only mean work for the palestinians , but also the gradual development of the palestinians ' industrial infrastructure .
it could be profitable for everyone involved .
business should and could do a lot and would turn a very good profit . so you 're appealing to german and israeli businesspeople to invest jointly in gaza ? yes , in gaza to start with , but a second step would be to invest in the west bank too .
that 's also possible , not everywhere , but i expect the occupation there to gradually recede somehow as well .
it wo n't happen at once , but in stages .
investment is also highly necessary there and business could make a good profit .
-lrb- german business -rrb- could very well cooperate with israeli business people , who know the ropes and have experience there . israel has succeeded in the dramatic change from an economy defined by agriculture to one focused on high tech .
are there lessons for germany in israel 's example ? yes , of course , there are lessons for the germans .
in high-tech industries in particular , they have invested little compared to france or america .
israel gradually developed into an industrialized country and from there towards high-tech industry .
the germans are not very progressive in this area .
in the area of services germany is not as progressive as it should and could be .
there , israelis could invest in germany .
there are already israeli investments in high tech on location , especially in germany 's new states . germany has had massive economic problems for years .
unemployment and the deficit are , growth is low .
how do israelis view germany at the moment ? german industry looks just as it is .
it appears as a stagnating business .
it 's been that way for a couple of years now , and in israel people think that the election could perhaps change something .
we understand very well that business has a lot to do with psychology .
we never experienced such bad years for business as during the three years of the intifada .
for the first time in our history our gross national product shrunk . since the shift in the public mood as a result of the plan to pull out of the gaza strip , we have again experienced a boom and now the gross national product is already growing around 5 percent per year .
in 2004 it was already 4 percent .
this year it will be 5 percent and we expect even more next year .
what caused it ?
just one element : people 's mood .
we have been waiting for a turnaround in germany , because we thought that the election would have an effect .
at the moment , it unfortunately does n't look that way .
something has to happen for the germans to have confidence in themselves and their future .

" we 've nothing against bayern but there must be some tension , " henle said . the first team to get a chance to fill up its thirsty fans is the second-placed hamburg hsv on saturday .
the hsv will need even more motivation than the others : no team has lost more often to bayern munich - 50 of 80 games . if hsv ca n't clinch the beer for their fans tomorrow , the liters will climb - by 1,000 with every match until the prize is won - as bayern takes on wolfsburg , schalke , and duisburg . however long it takes , germany 's soccer fans will be rewarded for their patience ! dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 germany edges closer to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ongoing political theater in germany has attracted crowds christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely . " there was of course great difficulty in finding areas of agreement .
we do not foresee another round of talks for the moment , " merkel told reporters after the talks in berlin ended .
" this does not mean that the talks were not honest , open and peaceful and that all doors are closed forever . " she said a decision would only be taken about further talks with the greens once the conservatives had held a second round of negotiations next wednesday with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats . neither merkel 's christian democrats nor the social democrats of chancellor gerhard schröder won a governing majority in sunday 's election , sparking a race to form a coalition government . the pro-environment greens on friday said they saw no reason for further talks with what their co-president reinhard bütikofer called the " neo-liberal , anti-ecological " conservatives . " the differences are exceptionally big , " he told journalists . the meeting was merely " to find out what we have in common , " the greens ' co-president claudia roth said .
" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .

" i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " she acknowledged this week , referring to the combined forces of the christian democratic union and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leaders -lrb- from left -rrb- : joschka fischer , reinhard bütikofer and claudia roth the greens have been mooted as a potential third partner in a coalition between merkel 's party and the free-market liberal free democrats .
the proposed three-way pact has been dubbed a " jamaica " coalition because the parties ' respective green , black and yellow colors match those of the caribbean nation 's flag . foreign minister joschka fischer , the greens ' most visible member , said he believed the three parties ' policies were simply too far apart for such an arrangement to function . " i just ca n't see how jamaica could work , " he told friday 's berliner zeitung newspaper .
the conservatives and the greens are diametrically opposed on turkey 's bid to join the european union , on plans to reform germany 's complicated tax system and to phase out the nation 's use of nuclear power .
intransigence on both sides the conservatives and the free democrats had planned to rule together but failed to draw enough votes .
instead of winning 40 percent as predicted , the conservatives took just 35.2 percent to finish less than a percentage point ahead of schröder 's social democrats .
the knife-edge result has sparked a standoff between schröder and merkel as to who should become germany 's next chancellor , and it looks unlikely to be resolved soon . both politicians stuck to their guns on thursday when their parties met for exploratory talks on forming a so-called grand coalition .
it is seen by observers as the most viable way out of the impasse created by the vote , but there are fears that the two parties would fail to bury their differences and implement reforms needed to rescue germany 's troubled economy . merkel , a 51-year-old former scientist who wants to become germany 's first female leader , said as she emerged from the meeting that " clear differences " remained between the parties ' positions .
she also reiterated that it was she , and not schröder , who had won a mandate to form a government and therefore deserved to head whatever coalition comes out of the next days or weeks of horse-trading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and müntefering " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to govern , " she said . the leader of the social democrats , franz müntefering , countered : " we made it clear we want to govern with schröder as chancellor . "
germans want grand coalition a so-called grand coalition between the cdu / csu and the spd now appears to be the only viable way out of the political impasse created by the election .
an opinion poll published by the emnid institute on thursday showed that germans would prefer merkel to be at the head of such a coalition , with 47 percent backing her and 44 percent schröder . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .

the road to the chancellery cdu , spd closer than they think germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 stop and go in traffic light coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd -lrb- red -rrb- , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- greens are far apart on major points would a coalition between the social democrats , the greens , and the neo-liberal fdp be possible ?
a look at where they 're similar , and where there are problems . the only absolute guarantee for chancellor gerhard schröder to remain just that would be to extend his coalition of social democrats and green party by one and add the pro-business free democrats .
but the fdp , which waged bitter war against many red-green proposals during the election , said they 'd rather go into the opposition than face the reality of a " traffic-light coalition . " indeed , foreign policy might be the only field that the spd , the fdp and the greens all generally agree on .
unfortunately for schröder , that 's not a dealmaker in germany at the moment . labor market in the labor market , the neo-liberals are far away from the red-green government .
both the spd and the greens want to keep measures in place that forbid companies above 10 employees to hire and fire workers .
the fdp argues vigorously that the inability of companies to make snap personnel decisions is one of the reasons companies no longer want to invest in germany .
the neo-liberals ' plan to dismantle the federal employment agency is also anti-red-green , which renamed and refurbished the agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal employment agency would be dismantled if the fdp got its wish the spd 's talk of a set minimum wage also goes against fdp notions of labor flexibility .
the three parties do share similar ideas on how to tweak the red-green government 's hartz iv labor market reforms -lrb- introduced in 2003 -rrb- , such as better pension plans .
all parties also agree that the low-wage sector needs to be expanded . health care the spd and greens want germans , no matter how they earn their money , to contribute to public health funds , that form the backbone of the social welfare system .
under the spd plan , every health insurance company would be required to insure a person , regardless of risk .
there would be no distinction between private and statutory insurance plans .
the insurance rates would be income-based . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants public health funds to cover every person , regardless of risk or cost the neo-liberals would like to privatize the public health funds entirely , but not allow them to reject applicants or make those who are sick pay higher premiums .
further disagreements remain over nursing care insurance , which the fdp wants to eliminate over time and the spd and greens want to expand . budget policy while the neo-liberals want to introduce cost-cutting measures and financial discipline , the red-green government has refused to tighten the belt any further at a time when the economy is performing miserably .
the approaches highlight one of the major divides between the red-green government and the fdp : how big a role should the state play in trying to spark economic growth ? differing tax philosophies are also one of the major reasons a traffic-light coalition will probably never happen . in an effort to simplify the tax code , the fdp wants to eliminate loopholes and significantly lower taxes for the rich .
the spd and greens , on the other hand , want to raise taxes for wealthier germans in an effort to balance out public spending , and want some tax loopholes , like one that compensates commuters , to stay in place . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in stade became the first one taken off the grid as part of the red-green government 's nuclear phase-out the environment is the likely major battlefield between the fdp and the greens .
one of the biggest green party accomplishments after their seven years in the government was convincing germany 's energy companies to phase out nuclear energy and replace it with alternative energy - like wind and hydro-power .
the fdp wants to keep nuclear energy around and only encourage alternative energy sources if they prove profitable .

birthler , the federal commissioner of the records of the national security service of the former german democratic republic , added that all of them should let their files be examined . the public had a right to know about their activities in the communist government and that all new left party parliamentarians should voluntarily allow themselves to be subject to a background check , birthler told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper in halle . she added that it was possible that there were more than the seven known former " informal employees " of the stasi in the left party , which is made up of disgruntled social democrats and ex-communists from the former east germany .
should any left party parliamentarians resist having their files made public , it would demonstrate that they still found it to be slanderous . the freedom to uncover past wrongs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of records are housed in birthler 's agency " they should voluntarily subject themselves to this process , " birthler said of the new left party representatives . a civil rights activist who was one of the leaders of the demonstrations that contributed to the fall of the gdr in november , 1989 , birthler said she believes that the law which created her agency should be amended to allow for more open study of east germany 's dark past . the current law , which created the agency in 1990 , is more restrictive than birthler would like .
until now , researchers have only been able to access documents pertaining to the activities of the ministry for state security , the stasi bureaucracy .
birthler would like to see a more liberal law that allows for access to many aspects of life in the gdr , from statistics on consumerism to the working practices of the sed , the lone party in the gdr . birthler positively summed up the work of the nearly 15-year-old agency , a first of its kind in the world . " we are recognized as a world leader in the work of coming to terms with the past through education and scholarship , " she said .
the agency has already processed 1.5 million requests for formerly secret files from the gdr , as well as cooperated on hundreds of research projects by historians , research scholars , and journalists . a mandate from a broad majority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler has led the eponymous agency since 2000 federal commissioner birthler took office in 2000 and is up for re-election in the coming weeks .
she is hoping that whoever is elected to the post can enjoy support from all five bundestag parliamentary groups . " it would be very important for this office , when the future federal commissioner could rely on a vote from all parliamentary groups , " she said .
the work of her agency , however , is only one contributor to a greater debate on the societal level , birthler said .
" we are not the repair apparatus of democracy , " she said , referring to the restrictive access to information on the gdr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 left party not yet out of the power game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could end up with an influential role in german politics the left party was the only contender in the german polls who could claim a full victory , winning 8.7 percent of votes in their first bid for power .
they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.09.2005 left party not yet out of the power game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party could end up with an influential role in german politics the left party was the only contender in the german polls who could claim a full victory , winning 8.7 percent of votes in their first bid for power .
they may yet end up being the king-makers . going from zero to 54 parliamentarians in the bundestag or the lower house of parliament following sunday 's general elections , germany 's left party should be on cloud nine this week . the newly formed party of disgruntled social democrats and former communists became the fourth-largest group in parliament after sunday 's election . neither the christian union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their preferred coalition partners , the free democrats , nor the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party , the current government coalition , won a majority of votes in the election . but despite their glowing results , the left party has n't ended up playing king-maker . though the left party could make up the difference between a majority or minority coalition for either constellation , all four parties have rejected working with them .
for its part , the leftists have said they would not tolerate an spd-green minority government - the only parties with ideas that connect with their own . but parliamentary opposition may not be the left party 's fate , after all . several left party parliamentarians said on wednesday that they would tolerate continuation of the current coalition if the social democrats would make changes to their agenda , despite the spd 's insistence that gerhard schröder remain chancellor .
conditions for toleration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left party parliamentarian hüseyin-kenan aydin said labor and tax policies would have to be adjusted .
" if the spd says we want schröder and we accept the conditions , then we 'll also vote schröder , " he said .
aydin added that his opinions did not differ from those of the party 's leaders , gregor gysi and oscar lafontaine . but the leftists ' campaign manager , bodo ramelow , rejected the option , saying that not one left party parliamentarian would back schröder 's policies . several further left party parliamentarians said they too , could imagine their party tolerating an spd-green coalition . " a minority government is an option , " sabine zimmermann told news web site spiegel online .
she said that in light of germany 's high unemployment , something had to be done quickly and that she could n't comprehend that the spd ruled out any cooperation with her party .
parliamentarian alexander ulrich said toleration depended on the spd and greens ruling out deployment of the german army abroad . on tuesday , oskar lafontaine , the left party 's designated parliamentary group leader , praised the spd and green party agendas and also implied that his party could possibly work with them . " i could sign the green 's election manifesto as it is .
it 's not far from the party that i currently represent , " he said on german public broadcaster ard .
" the spd 's revised agenda before the election had less to do with the actions of the past seven years , " he commented .
" if one were to orient oneself on the issues , there would now certainly be an exciting situation . "
slight shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler though neither the spd nor the greens have made any overtures to suggest they would work with the left party , their seemingly determined stance seems to be weakening . spd deputy parliamentary group leader gernot erler -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on thursday on inforadio berlin-brandenburg that there would not be a coalition between the social democrats , the greens and the left party , but that did n't mean that the 54 parliamentarians from the left were " air . " and the green 's christian ströbele , deputy leader of his party 's parliamentary group , said that the leftists ' rejection of a coalition with the spd and greens was a " big mistake .

the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .
adoption , too , is trailing . recent figures published by the federal statistics office show that adoption rates in germany are in a state of systematic decline .
in 1994 , some 11,453 children were adopted but the figure has been gradually falling ever since then , and reached an all time low of just 5,064 last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the youth services try to encourage mothers to keep their babies some say this is indeed good news : the fewer children , who need to be separated from their natural parents , for whatever reason that might be , the better .
others say it is a sign of the times , a reflection of the struggling economy and the fact that there are simply fewer babies being born in germany .
indeed , there are more adoption applicants than infants to go round . but given that the birth rate is largely said to be slumping among more educated women - who do not historically spawn the majority of children put up for adoption - that ca n't be the whole picture .
adoption is last resort heidrun sauer , who works for a group which supports foster parents , " familien für kinder " -lrb- families for children -rrb- , said that given the finality of adoption , there are now great support systems in place to encourage parents to consider the options and enable them to keep their children .
" if a mother decides to put her child up for adoption , she knows she might never see it , or even hear about its development , again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besides that , adoption statistics can only take into consideration those who are registered with the german authorities .
as dorothee von wahl of the statistics office stressed , there is no legal requirement to do so .
" there are certainly cases of foreign adoption which do n't have to be registered in germany , " she said .
" as long as the parents have official paperwork from the country of adoption , there is no need to inform the authorities . "
demand outstrips domestic supply some 32 percent of children registered as adopted by german parents last year came from abroad , but the total figure is likely to have been significantly higher .
alfred meyer is chairman of a state-registered adoption placement agency which matches german parents to children in haiti , peru , brazil , mongolia , thailand and sri lanka .
he said people are opting to adopt outside germany because there simply are n't enough german children to go round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphans in china " for each german child up for adoption , there are 20 applicants , which makes it a gamble , " he said .
" in adopting from abroad , the chances are much higher . "
but it 's not as simple as making an application and walking off with a brand new baby .
those who take this route into parenting have to go through a process which makes pregnancy and childbirth seem a doodle .
" applicants have their homes and bank balances examined , " meyer said .
" they are subjected to mental and physical checks , and their reasons for wishing to adopt are scrutinized in detail .
the whole process takes between one and two years , but even once the applicants have been given the all clear , they have to wait anything up to another two years before they actually have their child . "
and time is not the only price they have to pay .
if parents decide to go through an agency such as meyer 's " eltern für kinder " -lrb- parents for children -rrb- , they also have to part with almost 9,000 euros -lrb- $ 10,900 -rrb- , not including their travel and accommodation costs .
how child-friendly is germany really ?
although agencies continue to attract would-be parents , meyer said he believes germany is rife with a " ca n't be bothered to have kids " attitude .
" if people can get it together to have just one , they feel like they 've done their bit , if they have three , people start looking at them in a strange way .
it 's just not a very child-friendly country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foster parents often take more than one child at a time while birth and adoption rates continue to dwindle , the number of foster children , however , has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years .
on average , 10,000 children are taken into temporary care each year , bringing the total number of foster children to around the 50,000 mark .
although there is a constant need for more foster families , heidrun sauer said she is amazed at the level of willingness to take needy children in , both on a short or long-term basis .
" there are so many different levels of motivation , but i would say that for the majority , there is a sense of social responsibility , they want to help , " she said .
" they might be people who have lived through their own hard times and who now want to give something back . "
there are those who argue that foster parents are sometimes just in it for the money , which in germany amounts to either 650 or 800 euros monthly , depending on the age of the child .
sauer said that although there are always exceptions , the amount they are paid compared to the extra costs they incur renders the argument null and void .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy family by the same token , she has seen little evidence of a failing will in light of germany 's current economic climate .
" i am amazed at how many people are prepared to give up on the idea of having their own children and take a different path , to give up their jobs to be able to enjoy a life with children , " she said . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

a report by the national association of pension funds -lrb- napf -rrb- said everyone should be eligible for a " citizen 's pension " starting at £ 109 a week .
but , to ensure the payment rises in line with average earnings , people would have to retire later , it added .
the report has been submitted to the pension commission , which will outline its reform proposals later this year .
its report suggested britons would not be able to pick up their pensions until the age of 67 by 2030 , rising to 69 years of age by 2040 .
citizens pension the napf first put forward its idea of a universal citizens pension in december , as a way of removing 10 million future pensioners from means tested benefits .
the pension would be a payment available to anyone resident in the uk who reaches a set pensionable age , regardless of national insurance contributions .
have your say how many employers would be prepared to employ this older generation c preece , tamworth , uk send us your comments the napf said the proposed system would ensure that many women - who often fail to make full national insurance contributions - would still receive a full state pension .
the new system could be funded by pooling all the money that is currently put into the basic state pension , the state second pension , contracted out schemes and pension credits , the napf has said .
retire later however , to ensure that the value of new pension keeps rising in line with earnings - rather than just with inflation as at present - the state retirement age would also have to rise .
" it is realistic to assume that the state pension age will have to go up to 67 , or even higher at some point in the future , " an napf spokesman said .
the organisation 's final report is being submitted to the government and the pensions commission - led by adair turner - which is expected to publish its final recommendations for reform in november .
earlier this week chancellor gordon brown said the uk must have a " national debate " about raising the state pension age .
he stressed that nothing would be decided until such widespread discussions had taken place .
last sunday , work and pensions secretary david blunkett also said a further rise in the state pension age should be considered .
he has been in the usa where they are already committed to phasing in a state retirement age of 67 .

the country has the world 's deadliest mining industry , and thousands die each year in mining accidents .
this campaign was supposed to be part of a major drive to improve safety in its coal mines .
local officials often have shares in the mines , which have risen in value as coal fuels the booming economy .
but poor safety standards and many illegal operations have led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 miners in the first half of this year alone .
beijing ordered all local officials to give up their stakes after growing public anger about the problem .
now , though , it has admitted that those orders have been ignored by many communist party cadres .
one quoted in the state media said he would rather give up his official position than lose his shares .
it is a stark reminder that in the new china , beijing 's control over local government is weakening as officials put profit before the party .

the country has the world 's deadliest mining industry , and thousands die each year in mining accidents .
this campaign was supposed to be part of a major drive to improve safety in its coal mines .
local officials often have shares in the mines , which have risen in value as coal fuels the booming economy .
but poor safety standards and many illegal operations have led to the deaths of nearly 3,000 miners in the first half of this year alone .
beijing ordered all local officials to give up their stakes after growing public anger about the problem .
now , though , it has admitted that those orders have been ignored by many communist party cadres .
one quoted in the state media said he would rather give up his official position than lose his shares .
it is a stark reminder that in the new china , beijing 's control over local government is weakening as officials put profit before the party .

campaigners in blaenau ffestiniog told health board officials they objected to all the options put forward .
the plans involve cutting all 17 beds at the hospital and also losing beds at nearby tywyn hospital .
health officials said the change was needed to ensure facilities were suitable for the future .
the meeting follows a protest march last weekend , attended by more than 1,000 people .
lead campaigner geraint vaughan-jones s received massive backing at the meeting and afterwards he said : " you sense the feeling here and if they insist on carrying on with these proposals then we 'll be taking it further .
" if they say that they 're here to listen to the people and if they are going to go away tonight 's and say they have not heard anything , what can you do except carry on and try to get what we really require in the town . "
there has been a public consultation since july , when gwynedd local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- announced the plans .
where are they going to get the nurses to visit people in their own homes , where will they get the money to pay them to travel around ?
dwynwen thomas , hospital campaigner the health board said the memorial hospital was " not providing services in an efficient way , due to low bed occupancy rates " .
it also said the hospital building , which was built in 1925 , was " unsuitable in terms of ward layout and ensuring the privacy of patients " .
grace lewis-parry , from the health board , told bbc wales today : " it 's a very difficult and sensitive area for people to think about the longer term and obviously each and everyone of us has fears and anxieties about the future .
the lhb plans include cutting all in-patient facilities at the hospital , and increasing the amount of home care .
but the minor injuries unit and x-ray services would continue to be provided .
inpatient services would transfer to bron-y-garth hospital and later to the new hospital in tremadog .
but supporters of the hospital want to see more , not fewer , facilities .
more than 1,000 people took part in saturday 's march " the arguments they have put forward just do n't make sense , " said dwynwen thomas , a member of the ffestiniog memorial hospital defence committee .
" they 've told us that hospitals with less than 30 beds are unviable and yet they are building a new hospital in porthmadog with 24 beds . "
more assistance " they tell us that care for the terminally ill will be in their own homes .
where are they going to get the nurses to visit people in their own homes , where will they get the money to pay them to travel around ? " she said .
gwynedd county council 's head of social services glyn hughes noted in a report on the hospitals review that closing the beds would mean " carers would need more assistance . "
the lhb said the reorganisation would improve health services including " a team of nurses , therapists and social workers to provide support and rehabilitation at home , a heart failure service , substance misuse service , palliative care at home and chronic disease management . "
the local health board is due to make its final decision on the hospital 's future on 3 november .
but if it does not have the backing of meirionnydd community health council , the decision will pass to welsh health minister dr brian gibbons .

health officials said the change was needed to ensure facilities were suitable for the future .
the meeting follows a protest march last weekend , attended by more than 1,000 people .
lead campaigner geraint vaughan-jones s received massive backing at the meeting and afterwards he said : " you sense the feeling here and if they insist on carrying on with these proposals then we 'll be taking it further .
" if they say that they 're here to listen to the people and if they are going to go away tonight 's and say they have not heard anything , what can you do except carry on and try to get what we really require in the town . "
there has been a public consultation since july , when gwynedd local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- announced the plans .
where are they going to get the nurses to visit people in their own homes , where will they get the money to pay them to travel around ?
dwynwen thomas , hospital campaigner the health board said the memorial hospital was " not providing services in an efficient way , due to low bed occupancy rates " .
it also said the hospital building , which was built in 1925 , was " unsuitable in terms of ward layout and ensuring the privacy of patients " .
grace lewis-parry , from the health board , told bbc wales today : " it 's a very difficult and sensitive area for people to think about the longer term and obviously each and everyone of us has fears and anxieties about the future .
the lhb plans include cutting all in-patient facilities at the hospital , and increasing the amount of home care .
but the minor injuries unit and x-ray services would continue to be provided .
inpatient services would transfer to bron-y-garth hospital and later to the new hospital in tremadog .
but supporters of the hospital want to see more , not fewer , facilities .
more than 1,000 people took part in saturday 's march " the arguments they have put forward just do n't make sense , " said dwynwen thomas , a member of the ffestiniog memorial hospital defence committee .
" they 've told us that hospitals with less than 30 beds are unviable and yet they are building a new hospital in porthmadog with 24 beds . "
more assistance " they tell us that care for the terminally ill will be in their own homes .
where are they going to get the nurses to visit people in their own homes , where will they get the money to pay them to travel around ? " she said .
gwynedd county council 's head of social services glyn hughes noted in a report on the hospitals review that closing the beds would mean " carers would need more assistance . "
the lhb said the reorganisation would improve health services including " a team of nurses , therapists and social workers to provide support and rehabilitation at home , a heart failure service , substance misuse service , palliative care at home and chronic disease management . "
the local health board is due to make its final decision on the hospital 's future on 3 november .
but if it does not have the backing of meirionnydd community health council , the decision will pass to welsh health minister dr brian gibbons .

speaking at an industry meeting , mr eddington said that " america , the land of the free , is turning itself into the land of the free ride " .
four of the biggest us airlines are in chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , which effectively allows them to keep flying while they sort out their finances .
mr eddington said there were too many airlines and some needed to close .
busier skies " the world does not need 300 airlines , " mr eddington explained , adding that a number of airlines are " operating in protected markets " .
" they exist because of political demand , " he continued .
" they are hoovering up public funds and they still ca n't make a profit . "
mr eddington , who retires from ba at the end of this month , estimated that " in the last four years , the us airlines have soaked up $ 15bn to $ 20bn -lsb- £ 8.4bn to £ 11bn -rsb- of public subsidies and loan guarantees " .
he said there was enough business for between 10 and 20 major airlines worldwide , and that takeover rules need to be relaxed to make consolidation easier .
the comments came during one of mr eddington 's last engagements at the helm of ba , and after delta air lines and northwest airlines filed for chapter 11 .
the two firms joined united airlines and us airways , which already had filed , and their action now means that four of the seven biggest us firms are seeking protection from their creditors .
airlines worldwide are having to cope with increased competition from low-cost carriers and surging fuel prices .
the former boss of aer lingus , willie walsh , will take over from mr eddington .

but their podcasts will increasingly be on the radar of traditional radio broadcasters as fertile grounds to feed the desire for new talent , and ideas .
both the bbc and virgin will watch what podcasters do , learning from them , just as podcasters learned from radio .
" it wo n't be too long before this -lsb- podcasting -rsb- becomes the normal route to discover new talent , " says chris kimber , head of bbc radio interactive .
he was just one of more than 100 podcasters at europe 's inaugural podcasting conference , in london - podcastconuk .
podcasts are like radio shows done by anyone with a microphone , high-speed net connection and a computer .
the shows are put online for anyone to download or subscribe to .
it is barely a year old .
bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us james cridland , virgin radio it is a phenomenon that could have been a big threat to conventional radio 's business because suddenly they were not the only ones making and distributing programmes .
instead , it is being seen as a big opportunity , for both " professionals " and " amateurs " , according to both the bbc and virgin radio .
even those distinctions might have to change soon , given its impact .
" the phrase ' amateur podcaster ' should be banned , " thinks james cridland , head of strategic development at virgin radio .
not just about control podcasting has exploded not just because it gives people more control of what they want to listen to , when they want to or because , once subscribed to , the latest shows are delivered automatically to digital music players .
neither is it because podcasts let people listen to the bits within programmes that they want to , whizzing through the dull bits .
" a few months ago , you could guarantee that everyone listening to an ipod was not listening to radio , " explains the bbc 's mr kimber , who says it is part of its job to introduce mass audiences to podcasting .
podcasters are going to be fertile ground for new ideas " it was excluded from ipods . "
now , those easily identifiable white ear plugs might be piping through a radio show .
that , says mr kimber , could have posed a big threat to radio since there are 21 million ipods on the loose .
according to virgin 's mr cridland , 41 % of its online radio users own a portable digital music player - 32 % of them have ipods , and 68 % own " something else " .
the trend for portable programmes giving people the freedom to take their programmes out and about with them to listen to on portable devices is only part of the story .
the other key to its appeal , say the bbc and virgin , is about netting new audiences and opening people 's ears to new programmes .
" that audience is maybe people who do n't listen to virgin radio but bump into us in a podcast , " explains mr cridland .
mr kimber says podcasting introduces to programmes they would never usually listen to .
that obviously includes bumping into the shows that are not related to traditional broadcasters too .
in an online survey , 18 % of the virgin listeners said they first heard shows on a medium other than " radio " , said mr cridland .
" bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us , " he says .
so too is the value , which mr cridland says virgin has recognised , in the ability to listen to past shows .
restoring radio 's heart ?
to mainstream radio production powerhouses such as the bbc and virgin , podcasting is seen to be " putting the heart back into radio " .
to most podcasters outside of mainstream media , it is about having a much more level playing field which means that anyone with a microphone , computer and a broadband connection can be a creator and distributor of content .
podcasting , says mr kimber , focuses attention much more on the content of a show , now that the ability to make and distribute shows has been prised out of main media 's clutches .
it is clear that podcasting has really shaken up the radio world .
but are the powerful media outlets intent on re-claiming that power , or are they genuinely interested in listening to the average joe on the street ?
" it is a chance for the ' little guy ' to reach the top of the tree , " says mr cridland .
podcasting 's popularity , which has been boosted by the inclusion of podcast directories in itunes , means that traditional radio has to resist resting on its laurels because there is suddenly a lot more serious competition .
in the short term , thinks mr kimber , this is likely to affect the types of programmes that get commissioned for the bbc radio output .
just as video on mobile requires new thinking about what kinds of programmes , show lengths , quality and so on , so do does podcasting .
the way in which the uk 's traditional radio networks " does " podcasting , in the majority of cases , is by chopping out unusable bits , such as licensed music and news or time stamps , to make them stand alone as podcasts .
there are sometimes issues with taking these shows out of a wider programme 's context .
in the longer term , says mr kimber , the quality of what listeners get from conventional radio will improve , partly because of podcasting 's impact and its novel ideas about what and who people want to listen to .
at podcastconuk , mr cridland announced that virgin 's new unsigned band show , virgin radio extreme , had been created with podcasting at its heart .
the entire show , because it features unsigned bands eager for exposure , is a podcast .
another newly-announced show features the best of the old and new shows that have been broadcast on virgin .
there is a possible vic reeves podcast in the works too .

" it wo n't be too long before this -lsb- podcasting -rsb- becomes the normal route to discover new talent , " says chris kimber , head of bbc radio interactive .
he was just one of more than 100 podcasters at europe 's inaugural podcasting conference , in london - podcastconuk .
podcasts are like radio shows done by anyone with a microphone , high-speed net connection and a computer .
the shows are put online for anyone to download or subscribe to .
it is barely a year old .
bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us james cridland , virgin radio it is a phenomenon that could have been a big threat to conventional radio 's business because suddenly they were not the only ones making and distributing programmes .
instead , it is being seen as a big opportunity , for both " professionals " and " amateurs " , according to both the bbc and virgin radio .
even those distinctions might have to change soon , given its impact .
" the phrase ' amateur podcaster ' should be banned , " thinks james cridland , head of strategic development at virgin radio .
not just about control podcasting has exploded not just because it gives people more control of what they want to listen to , when they want to or because , once subscribed to , the latest shows are delivered automatically to digital music players .
neither is it because podcasts let people listen to the bits within programmes that they want to , whizzing through the dull bits .
" a few months ago , you could guarantee that everyone listening to an ipod was not listening to radio , " explains the bbc 's mr kimber , who says it is part of its job to introduce mass audiences to podcasting .
podcasters are going to be fertile ground for new ideas " it was excluded from ipods . "
now , those easily identifiable white ear plugs might be piping through a radio show .
that , says mr kimber , could have posed a big threat to radio since there are 21 million ipods on the loose .
according to virgin 's mr cridland , 41 % of its online radio users own a portable digital music player - 32 % of them have ipods , and 68 % own " something else " .
the trend for portable programmes giving people the freedom to take their programmes out and about with them to listen to on portable devices is only part of the story .
the other key to its appeal , say the bbc and virgin , is about netting new audiences and opening people 's ears to new programmes .
" that audience is maybe people who do n't listen to virgin radio but bump into us in a podcast , " explains mr cridland .
mr kimber says podcasting introduces to programmes they would never usually listen to .
that obviously includes bumping into the shows that are not related to traditional broadcasters too .
in an online survey , 18 % of the virgin listeners said they first heard shows on a medium other than " radio " , said mr cridland .
" bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us , " he says .
so too is the value , which mr cridland says virgin has recognised , in the ability to listen to past shows .
restoring radio 's heart ?
to mainstream radio production powerhouses such as the bbc and virgin , podcasting is seen to be " putting the heart back into radio " .
to most podcasters outside of mainstream media , it is about having a much more level playing field which means that anyone with a microphone , computer and a broadband connection can be a creator and distributor of content .
podcasting , says mr kimber , focuses attention much more on the content of a show , now that the ability to make and distribute shows has been prised out of main media 's clutches .
it is clear that podcasting has really shaken up the radio world .
but are the powerful media outlets intent on re-claiming that power , or are they genuinely interested in listening to the average joe on the street ?
" it is a chance for the ' little guy ' to reach the top of the tree , " says mr cridland .
podcasting 's popularity , which has been boosted by the inclusion of podcast directories in itunes , means that traditional radio has to resist resting on its laurels because there is suddenly a lot more serious competition .
in the short term , thinks mr kimber , this is likely to affect the types of programmes that get commissioned for the bbc radio output .
just as video on mobile requires new thinking about what kinds of programmes , show lengths , quality and so on , so do does podcasting .
the way in which the uk 's traditional radio networks " does " podcasting , in the majority of cases , is by chopping out unusable bits , such as licensed music and news or time stamps , to make them stand alone as podcasts .
there are sometimes issues with taking these shows out of a wider programme 's context .
in the longer term , says mr kimber , the quality of what listeners get from conventional radio will improve , partly because of podcasting 's impact and its novel ideas about what and who people want to listen to .
at podcastconuk , mr cridland announced that virgin 's new unsigned band show , virgin radio extreme , had been created with podcasting at its heart .
the entire show , because it features unsigned bands eager for exposure , is a podcast .
another newly-announced show features the best of the old and new shows that have been broadcast on virgin .
there is a possible vic reeves podcast in the works too .

but their podcasts will increasingly be on the radar of traditional radio broadcasters as fertile grounds to feed the desire for new talent , and ideas .
both the bbc and virgin will watch what podcasters do , learning from them , just as podcasters learned from radio .
" it wo n't be too long before this -lsb- podcasting -rsb- becomes the normal route to discover new talent , " says chris kimber , head of bbc radio interactive .
he was just one of more than 100 podcasters at europe 's inaugural podcasting conference , in london - podcastconuk .
podcasts are like radio shows done by anyone with a microphone , high-speed net connection and a computer .
the shows are put online for anyone to download or subscribe to .
it is barely a year old .
bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us james cridland , virgin radio it is a phenomenon that could have been a big threat to conventional radio 's business because suddenly they were not the only ones making and distributing programmes .
instead , it is being seen as a big opportunity , for both " professionals " and " amateurs " , according to both the bbc and virgin radio .
even those distinctions might have to change soon , given its impact .
" the phrase ' amateur podcaster ' should be banned , " thinks james cridland , head of strategic development at virgin radio .
not just about control podcasting has exploded not just because it gives people more control of what they want to listen to , when they want to or because , once subscribed to , the latest shows are delivered automatically to digital music players .
neither is it because podcasts let people listen to the bits within programmes that they want to , whizzing through the dull bits .
" a few months ago , you could guarantee that everyone listening to an ipod was not listening to radio , " explains the bbc 's mr kimber , who says it is part of its job to introduce mass audiences to podcasting .
podcasters are going to be fertile ground for new ideas " it was excluded from ipods . "
now , those easily identifiable white ear plugs might be piping through a radio show .
that , says mr kimber , could have posed a big threat to radio since there are 21 million ipods on the loose .
according to virgin 's mr cridland , 41 % of its online radio users own a portable digital music player - 32 % of them have ipods , and 68 % own " something else " .
the trend for portable programmes giving people the freedom to take their programmes out and about with them to listen to on portable devices is only part of the story .
the other key to its appeal , say the bbc and virgin , is about netting new audiences and opening people 's ears to new programmes .
" that audience is maybe people who do n't listen to virgin radio but bump into us in a podcast , " explains mr cridland .
mr kimber says podcasting introduces to programmes they would never usually listen to .
that obviously includes bumping into the shows that are not related to traditional broadcasters too .
in an online survey , 18 % of the virgin listeners said they first heard shows on a medium other than " radio " , said mr cridland .
" bumping into us on a non-traditional platform is very important to us , " he says .
so too is the value , which mr cridland says virgin has recognised , in the ability to listen to past shows .
restoring radio 's heart ?
to mainstream radio production powerhouses such as the bbc and virgin , podcasting is seen to be " putting the heart back into radio " .
to most podcasters outside of mainstream media , it is about having a much more level playing field which means that anyone with a microphone , computer and a broadband connection can be a creator and distributor of content .
podcasting , says mr kimber , focuses attention much more on the content of a show , now that the ability to make and distribute shows has been prised out of main media 's clutches .
it is clear that podcasting has really shaken up the radio world .
but are the powerful media outlets intent on re-claiming that power , or are they genuinely interested in listening to the average joe on the street ?
" it is a chance for the ' little guy ' to reach the top of the tree , " says mr cridland .
podcasting 's popularity , which has been boosted by the inclusion of podcast directories in itunes , means that traditional radio has to resist resting on its laurels because there is suddenly a lot more serious competition .
in the short term , thinks mr kimber , this is likely to affect the types of programmes that get commissioned for the bbc radio output .
just as video on mobile requires new thinking about what kinds of programmes , show lengths , quality and so on , so do does podcasting .
the way in which the uk 's traditional radio networks " does " podcasting , in the majority of cases , is by chopping out unusable bits , such as licensed music and news or time stamps , to make them stand alone as podcasts .
there are sometimes issues with taking these shows out of a wider programme 's context .

there has been a big fall in the number of rescues involving dinghies off skegness - with four incidents this season , compared to 20 last summer .
the rnli said a mixture of weather conditions and the repeated warnings has made a difference this year .
but it is working to spread the message further afield to holidaymakers who head to the county 's coastal resorts .
the campaign tried to dissuade people from using inflatables in the sea as a safety measure .
ben hardaker from the rnli said : " if you have come from 100 miles away then you wo n't be aware of these on-going campaigns and this is what we are working on the most , to get these campaigns into the midlands and the north . "
he said the message was : " enjoy yourself but we want you to be safe . "
