" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .

"
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .
24 meeting of the un nuclear watchdog which could theoretically send iran to the security council and amid mounting concerns about the direction of ahmadinejad 's government . the eu-3 has attempted to persuade iran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment as a watertight guarantee that its nuclear program is peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has so far prevented iran from facing the security council but iran insists its right to enrichment is enshrined in both the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and its additional protocol .
iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .
24 meeting of the un nuclear watchdog which could theoretically send iran to the security council and amid mounting concerns about the direction of ahmadinejad 's government . the eu-3 has attempted to persuade iran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment as a watertight guarantee that its nuclear program is peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has so far prevented iran from facing the security council but iran insists its right to enrichment is enshrined in both the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and its additional protocol .
iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally .

does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention . " whoever restarts this debate will come under suspicion of trying to distract attention from the real problems we have , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .
24 meeting of the un nuclear watchdog which could theoretically send iran to the security council and amid mounting concerns about the direction of ahmadinejad 's government . the eu-3 has attempted to persuade iran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment as a watertight guarantee that its nuclear program is peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has so far prevented iran from facing the security council but iran insists its right to enrichment is enshrined in both the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and its additional protocol .
iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2005 opinion : europe 's lost future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venting their anger in toulouse the riots in france show that the integration model has failed .
things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention . " whoever restarts this debate will come under suspicion of trying to distract attention from the real problems we have , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .
others in his party agree .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention . " whoever restarts this debate will come under suspicion of trying to distract attention from the real problems we have , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 07.11.2005 of politicians , passports and popes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will get to keep his german passport , after all germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .
now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .
" what you see here is the beauty of nature juxtaposed with the horror of what once happened .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally .

" the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2005 opinion : europe 's lost future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venting their anger in toulouse the riots in france show that the integration model has failed .
things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .

france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .

now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

" all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " li said .
" this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with hu jintao hu leaves for a tour of britain , germany and spain on tuesday . the arms embargo has been a central issue for every high-level visit between china and eu countries for years . germa n y has backed lifti n g ba n france and germany have urged the lifting of the ban , but britain and other eu nations disagree , citing us security concerns in the asia pacific region , especially over taiwan . beijing has said it is not interested in buying european weapons , but that it is opposed to the ban in principle , especially as the eu and china have named their relationship a " strategic partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it doens 't want to buy european weapons " china 's position is very clear , " li said .
" what we are not in favor of and are opposed to is in fact that this ban involves and reflects political discrimination .
this political discrimination is not conducive to cooperation , it is totally useless and should be abandoned .
if we really look at mutual benefit this is what we should do . " the ban was implemented following the brutal crushing of the 1989 tiananmen democracy protests . european public opinion has also appeared to oppose the lifting based on human rights concerns . chi n a pulls trade trump card although li maintained there was little else china could do to nudge the eu toward the total lifting of the embargo , he did lay a veiled threat at increasingly lucrative bilateral trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely producing goods for europe " china 's trade volume with the eu has for the first time exceeded the trade volume between china and japan , without such discrimination no doubt the trade volume would be even bigger and we would have more benefits from the bilateral cooperation , " li said .
" the eu people , like the chinese people , will reap more benefits from this process . " eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-succession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally .

" the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .

rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "

rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .
another conference is to take place next year in nigeria . alexander göbel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches out to africa german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2005 opinion : europe 's lost future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venting their anger in toulouse the riots in france show that the integration model has failed .
things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2005 germany 's political chaos drowns out crunch issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even anti-reform protests have n't spurred politicians to move quickly german parties are bracing for a tumultuous week of horse-trading ahead of a self-imposed deadline to form a left-right coalition under angela merkel .
but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .

the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .

he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .
another conference is to take place next year in nigeria . alexander göbel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches out to africa german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .
another conference is to take place next year in nigeria . alexander göbel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches out to africa german president horst köhler and other german officials meet with african leaders , writers and ngos later this week in bonn to refocus attention on helping some of the world ’ s poorest people .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .

how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .

the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention . " whoever restarts this debate will come under suspicion of trying to distract attention from the real problems we have , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing .

now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .

the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .

he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike .

he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's not known for rioting " the main difference from paris is that there was no open confrontation " with police , melloh said . melloh said none of the suspects had been captured and that arson attacks were " rather unusual " in bremen . he described the district of huchting where the blazes took place as " a completely normal residential neighborhood " with a relatively low crime rate . in berlin 's moabit district , people also set five cars on fire and a police spokesman said that authorities were investigating any links to the france riots . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on tenth night , french violence worsens arsonists torched 1,300 cars and police arrested 300 people across france overnight saturday , as the urban violence which has rocked the country for 10 nights reached a new peak .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 07.11.2005 of politicians , passports and popes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will get to keep his german passport , after all germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .
now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

" these individuals seem to be looking for contact with police , and they are attacking us , unlike during the other nights , " a senior officer told afp . arsonists also set fire to cars and trash cans in the cities of nantes , orleans and rennes . a new edge to riots the new edge to the violence confirmed the riots were worsening , adding to a weekend that took the unrest to new heights with hundreds of vehicles burnt and up to 200 localities affected . so far , around 4,000 vehicles have been torched , including , overnight sunday , eight trucks parked near the town of roanne .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .
" what you see here is the beauty of nature juxtaposed with the horror of what once happened .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?
the iranian offer comes three weeks ahead of a nov .
24 meeting of the un nuclear watchdog which could theoretically send iran to the security council and amid mounting concerns about the direction of ahmadinejad 's government . the eu-3 has attempted to persuade iran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment as a watertight guarantee that its nuclear program is peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has so far prevented iran from facing the security council but iran insists its right to enrichment is enshrined in both the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and its additional protocol .
iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .
the united states has long accused the islamic state of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , although it has backed european efforts to engage with tehran so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has become even more cautious since ahmadinejad became president on sunday , iran formally asked britain , france and germany - which have led the eu diplomatic drive with tehran - to reopen the stalled talks , with top nuclear official ali larijani " insisting on the necessity of negotiations . "
in the iranian letter , larijani said that iran would " welcome negotiations -lrb- with the europeans -rrb- that are constructive and based on logic . " but the letter also insisted on " iran 's need to exercise its legitimate rights and to see its national interests guaranteed , " news agencies said , apparently backing up iran 's announcement that it would soon embark on fresh nuclear fuel work and was seeking investors for uranium enrichment activities . straw confirmed monday that " informal discussions " are continuing with the iranians , despite the deadlock on the formal nuclear talks . hinging on moscow ?

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 07.11.2005 of politicians , passports and popes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope will get to keep his german passport , after all germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .
now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

" we do n't know when this will happen , but we know it will happen , " lee said . " -lrb- ... -rrb-
if we are unprepared , the next pandemic will cause incalculable human misery ... no society will be exempt and no economy will be unscathed . " samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched . " the country lacks local veterinarians to check on flocks and epidemiologists to monitor and evaluate outbreaks and illegal vaccines are circulating , she said . mike ryan , director of the who 's epidemic and pandemic alert and response unit , said that fixing basic gaps in veterinary and human wealth would not come cheap . " we need capital investment .
this is going to cost money , " ryan said . the world bank said last friday it would make up to $ 500 million available to poor countries to help them meet the threat . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts meet to agree bird flu action plan attempts to avert a pandemic that could claim millions of lives and cost hundreds of billions of dollars take a step forward on monday with a top-level meeting to flesh out global action plans against bird flu .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride . during his recent visit to the vatican , bavarian premier and leader of the conservative social union -lrb- csu -rrb- edmund stoiber did what any practicing catholic would do if he got a chance for a private tête-à-tête with the leader of the catholic church : he confessed . the holy father , who just happens to be bavarian himself , asked stoiber why he had changed his mind about joining the government of his coalition partner and christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel are , it seems , not a match made in heaven stoiber , as he later told a small group of friends , answered that the situation in berlin had changed after franz müntefering decided to step down as leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
what 's more , stoiber and merkel are not best suited for each other : " i just ca n't deal with her , " stoiber said . it is unlikely that the holy father is himself leaking confession scoops to german tabloids .
he is , after all , sworn to professional secrecy .
but the alleged content of this conversation , nonetheless , ended up in the sunday edition of the german tabloid bild . stoiber should maybe start wondering about how loyal his friends really are . just like dynasty , only better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friendship across party lines : müntefering -lrb- left -rrb- and stoiber the bizarre spectacle of german politics - part soap-opera , part " dangerous liaisons " - does not cease to amaze the dumbfounded public .
how come stoiber ca n't stand angela merkel , his closest political ally , but seems so terribly fond of the leader of the social-democratic arch-nemesis ? is it because stoiber , as a good catholic , literally interpreted the biblical commandment : " love thy enemy ! " or is it because emotions sway more power than political convictions in the byzantine maze of post-election coalition building ?
will stoiber and müntefering , when all is said and done , forget about the economic reforms and walk happily into the sunset , holding hands ?
will angela merkel - whom stoiber once nonchalantly categorized as " the protestant woman from the east " - be driven mad by jealousy ? or will benedict xvi - the teutonic papa ex machina - be asked to interfere , march to berlin with his swiss guards and teach the german politicians how to get a clue ? collective papacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the day germany got itself a new pope germans are , after all , obsessed with having a compatriot on st. peter 's throne .
the same newspaper that reported about stoiber 's intimate chitchat with the pope , ran the headline " we are pope ! " when joseph ratzinger was elected pope in april 2005 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the overwhelming sense of collective german papacy has recently lead green party politician hans-christian ströbele to ask whether pope benedict xvi could still be considered german since the german law does n't allow dual citizenship . the german foreign ministry , however , fired back a very clever response : the pope actually never applied for foreign citizenship but was elected into office , which came with a convenient , no-strings-attached kind of bonus citizenship package .
german citizenship is revoked from those who apply for foreign citizenship , not for those who get it because they 're lucky . so , the pope gets to keep his german passport and the country gets to keep enjoying its pontifical mirror-image .
which is good .
if the cdu , csu and spd do n't get their act together and form a functioning government any time soon , radical changes on the german political horizon may have to be brought into play . how about : pope for chancellor ? dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of best stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe ...

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

" cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally .

rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption .

but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .

at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention . " whoever restarts this debate will come under suspicion of trying to distract attention from the real problems we have , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de let 's talk about " leitkultur " leading christian democrat and newly appointed parliamentary president norbert lammert says it 's time the nation took a new look at the issue of a german " leitkultur , " or leading culture .

conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention .

" the iranians are under the obligation to respond positively to the resolution of the board of governors at the international atomic energy agency in late september and we look to them to do that , " he said . talks broke down talks between iran and the 25-member european bloc broke off in august when iran , under new hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad , resumed uranium conversion in defiance of international calls to maintain a suspension .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .
" what you see here is the beauty of nature juxtaposed with the horror of what once happened .

she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing .

starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .

iran says it only wishes to enrich to the low-level purity required for reactor fuel but its enemies have accused tehran of seeking to make a nuclear bomb . previous attempts to haul iran before the un security council have foundered over russian opposition and moscow is once again expected to play a key role in november 's meeting . anti-tehran demonstrators used monday 's eu talks to highlight their opposition to europe 's efforts to engage with the islamic state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of an iranian opposition group demonstrate outside the eu council " expel the mullahs from the un " and " mullahs are terrorists , " read two banners brandished at the protest , kept away from the eu building where the ministers were meeting by a police blockade .

the divisive debate over a " leitkultur , " or predominant culture , has broken out in germany again .
conservatives tend to think defining the culture is important ; many on the left think it 's an attack on minorities . germany was successful in rebuilding its bombed and charred cities after world war two , but it was less successful in healing the deep wounds german culture and the national psyche suffered after 12 years of nazi rule . for decades , the phrase " german pride " was considered an oxymoron , something that had been rubbed out of existence after auschwitz .
but that began to change after reunification and in 2000 , conservative politician friedrich merz asked the question publicly : could germans be proud of their achievements and should there be common cultural guidelines that people ought to live by ?
it evoked some angry responses . now , the new president of the bundestag , norbert lammert , another conservative politician , has said it is time to look again at what makes germany german .
he is not comfortable with the term " leitkultur , " which he says conjures up a sense of superiority of one culture over another .
but he says he wants to get beyond the provocative nature of the term itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert with cdu leader angela merkel " the prospects of a really constructive discussion are far greater today than they were a few years ago , " he said .
" the truth is that there are cultural differences , and the truth is also that these differences , and the conflicts that occasionally arise from them , are anything but irrelevant . " he mentioned the concept of gender equality , which in germany is enshrined in the law .
in some immigrant communities , fathers arrange marriages for their daughters and women are of second rank . " the right to equality for women , culturally based on our historical experience , and the right of the man to dominate in other cultural circles , also culturally based , can not exist in one and the same society , " he said . lammert said that while german society is a multicultural one , there should be a visible common thread that holds society together .
according to him , a society needs to come to an agreement that there is at least a minimal level of " orientation " that should apply to everyone , regardless of ethnic or cultural background . is it necessary ? but others think this debate is n't leading anywhere . according to claudia roth , now head of the green party , the country 's constitution paves the way for a peaceful coexistence of cultures and lammert should see germany 's cultural diversity as a defining value in itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " he should realize that what he 's doing is not encouraging debate but unleashing serious controversies , " she said .
" the concept of a defining german culture is nothing more than an attack on minorities in our country . " thomas nord , head of the new left party , also said he has misgivings about reigniting the debate of a term which he said would not lead toward addressing issues that needed attention .

things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .

" samuel jutzi , director of the animal production and health division at the food and agricultural organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , said " the window of opportunity " remained open for tackling the threat at its source : on the farm . " the virus has not yet reassorted or mutated , " said jutzi .
" action is required now .
there is no time to lose here . " highest-level global meet on bird flu the geneva confab is the senior-most global meeting of doctors , veterinarians and public-health officials since the avian influenza scare erupted in 2003 .
it is also the first to gather the world bank alongside the who , the fao and world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , a paris-based agency that sets veterinary standards in farm trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a south korean health official sprays disinfectant at a chicken farm , north of seoul the conference takes place against a backdrop of growing concern about the failure to stem the h5n1 bird flu virus in asia , its spread to europe and the vulnerability of africa , the world 's poorest continent . " we have experienced a relentless spread of avian flu , " lee said somberly .
he added that 63 deaths , out of 124 known cases of human infection , had been reported to the who , 150 million fowl had been slaughtered and the economic cost of the virus was more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 8.46 billion euros -rrb- . the world bank 's leading economist for east asia and the pacific , milan brahmbhatt , said that a major pandemic could clip between two or three percent off the global economy , inflicting costs of as much as $ 800 billion after a year . for rich countries alone , the cost could be 550 billion dollars , the world bank said separately in a report issued in geneva . fear of virus mutation at present , h5n1 is transmissible from bird to humans who are closely exposed to virus expelled by sickly fowl in their faeces and nasal secretions . but it can not be easily passed from humans to humans .
the fear is that the more the virus spreads , the greater chance it has to mutate , picking up genes from ordinary flu that could make it highly contagious from humans to humans . this feared mutation could occur if h5n1 is transmitted to a human or a pig that already has been infected by the conventional flu virus . no one would have any immunity against the new pathogen , which means a pandemic could swiftly spread in the modern era of jet travel and the globalized economy . looking at preventive measures the geneva meeting is looking at national and global preparations for coping with a pandemic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs and vaccines are being developed to fight bird flu these include stockpiling drugs and face masks , preparing hospitals for an emergency , setting up emergency transport and food supplies , and advising the public in order to avert a panic . but a bigger priority is to target the risk of a virus mutation itself , among domestic fowl where h5n1 has holed up .
this means beefing up veterinary surveillance , culling infected poultry , protecting fowl with h5n1 vaccine and reporting cases of infection swiftly and accurately . another task is to compensate farmers for culls .
if too little is offered , farmers may hide an outbreak of disease ; if too much is offered , they may be tempted to deliberately infect their birds , said brahmbhatt . helping poorer nations cope indonesia 's state minister for national development planning , sri mulyani indrawati , acknowledged that her country was wrestling with major problems , and " at sometimes we are quite overstretched .

" all the leaders of the eu that i have come in contact with believe that -lrb- the embargo -rrb- is a legacy of the cold war , is poorly founded and is useless and only harmful , " li said .
" this should have been thrown into the trash heap of history a long time ago . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder with hu jintao hu leaves for a tour of britain , germany and spain on tuesday . the arms embargo has been a central issue for every high-level visit between china and eu countries for years . germa n y has backed lifti n g ba n france and germany have urged the lifting of the ban , but britain and other eu nations disagree , citing us security concerns in the asia pacific region , especially over taiwan . beijing has said it is not interested in buying european weapons , but that it is opposed to the ban in principle , especially as the eu and china have named their relationship a " strategic partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china says it doens 't want to buy european weapons " china 's position is very clear , " li said .
" what we are not in favor of and are opposed to is in fact that this ban involves and reflects political discrimination .
this political discrimination is not conducive to cooperation , it is totally useless and should be abandoned .
if we really look at mutual benefit this is what we should do . " the ban was implemented following the brutal crushing of the 1989 tiananmen democracy protests . european public opinion has also appeared to oppose the lifting based on human rights concerns . chi n a pulls trade trump card although li maintained there was little else china could do to nudge the eu toward the total lifting of the embargo , he did lay a veiled threat at increasingly lucrative bilateral trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : likely producing goods for europe " china 's trade volume with the eu has for the first time exceeded the trade volume between china and japan , without such discrimination no doubt the trade volume would be even bigger and we would have more benefits from the bilateral cooperation , " li said .
" the eu people , like the chinese people , will reap more benefits from this process . " eu leaders once pledged to remove the ban by june this year , but china 's anti-succession law on taiwan , passed in april , stymied the effort due to heightened concerns that the law could eventually lead to war in the taiwan straits . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.11.2005 opinion : europe 's lost future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venting their anger in toulouse the riots in france show that the integration model has failed .
things do n't look much better elsewhere in europe , where similar acts of violence could come as a result , says dw 's andreas noll . liberty , equality , fraternity - few things in france are celebrated more frequently than the century-old reason of state .
after eleven nights of riots in a row , after burning cars throughout the country , attacks on disabled people and shots at policemen , this credo is nothing more than a wish - reality is a different issue . has the french state failed ?
over the last decades , governments across the political spectrum have invested several billion euros in modernization projects for problem areas - none of them with lasting effects . the previous socialist cabinet set up neighborhood police departments focused on dialogue , but was unable to take back lawless enclaves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rioters hurl stones against firefighters and policemen current interior minister nicolas sarkozy tried the law-and-order approach , but after 11 nights of police crackdown more and more cars are burning in more and more regions of the republic .
the emergency plan announced by the prime minister and the president 's admonishments will remain meaningless - and the rioters know it . from success to failure this is happening even though france 's model actually celebrated success stories in recent years : the french soccer team 's victory in the 1998 world cup is an example as it was mainly made up of the children of immigrants .
the ecstasy of a jubilant nation knew no bounds . things have changed since then : all agree that the system of quickly turning immigrants into frenchmen on paper has failed .
critics have a lot of arguments on their side .
the french passport is no guarantee for intergration nor does it supply people with work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting against the violence erecting satellite towns around paris , the economic heart of centralized france also proved to be a fatal mistake .
these ghettos that were celebrated as future-oriented during the 1960s are so desolate that it 's almost impossible to imagine a restoration . sarkozy 's about-turn people are currently calming themselves by blaming sarkozy .
he provoked many with his announcement that he would clean the problem districts with a " power-hose . "
even some of his supporters turned against him when his called rioters " rabble . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with residents near paris sarkozy said these things even though he has realized that " liberty , equality , fraternity " has lost its luster .
he 's been fighting for affirmative action against the president 's resistance .
he wants to give muslim immigrants preferential treatment in the hiring process for the civil service and do away with the principle of equality . but an unemotional debate about this issue is not possible right now .
france helplessly watches as youngsters set on fire the cars of their equally impoverished neighbors , how they torch the schools of their siblings , how they attack public transportation and enjoy the public 's attention while they destroy the foundation of their own lives . europe lacks strategy a lack of perspectives might help to explain these outbursts of violence from a sociological point of view , but society has no idea how to deal with this apocalyptic irrationality .
many just see how these young people are unable to escape the misery and make use of the existing chances of moving up socially . if it 's true that france with its five million muslim inhabitants foreshadows developments elswhere in europe , societal cohesion is n't only crumbling in the " grande nation . " attempts to integrate rapidly growing muslim communities in other countries have n't been much more successful .
europe has so far not found a solution for the integration of a group that has a hold on the future - at least from a demographic perspective - but that has no idea what this future should look like . andreas noll -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french riots claim first victim rampaging youths injured 30 policemen and torched hundreds of cars overnight sunday as rioting raged on for an 11th night in france despite a vow from president jacques chirac to restore public order .
-lrb- nov .
7 , 2005 -rrb- rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical .
-lrb- nov .
5 , 2005 -rrb- tough times for muslims in europe a report by human-rights watchdogs confirms something many europeans may have noticed on their own : life has gotten harder for muslims in europe since the terror attacks of sept .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it . " africa to take more responsibility köhler underlined that both sides must be ready to tackle unpleasant questions such as the unfair world trade system which massively discriminates against africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man runs past a billboard warning of the dangers of malaria in lagos , nigeria , he urged germany , the european union 's largest member country , to take a leading role in forgiving african debt and training young african professionals . nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who is also head of the african union , stressed that african nations must do more to take responsibility for their own development and fight corruption . " we have long blamed history , colonialism and everything that has happened in the past for our misery , " obasanjo said .
" now the time has come where we have to take responsibility for it , for where we stand and for what will become of us . " the conference in bonn was just the beginning of an initiative that the german president plans to continue during his entire office term .

and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally .

" the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality . " we all want partnership but why does it take so long for it to yield results ?
does it have to do with hypocrisy and double standards that we sow ?
does it have to do with the lack of honesty and integrity among us africans so that we make no progress ? "
mbeki said .
" if that is so then in the future we 'll discuss it together and see to it that we change it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2005 germany 's political chaos drowns out crunch issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even anti-reform protests have n't spurred politicians to move quickly german parties are bracing for a tumultuous week of horse-trading ahead of a self-imposed deadline to form a left-right coalition under angela merkel .
but key topics are being dodged . berlin is expecting a fraught week of hard bargaining and bickering before a government treaty is in the bag as the basis for incoming conservative chancellor angela merkel 's work . she is confident that the two negotiating sides will succeed in forging a solid power-sharing alliance despite all the recent turbulence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is still resolutely optimistic about forming a grand coalition " we - and that means all sides involved - will make a concerted effort to form a grand coalition ... that addresses the real problems of the country and leads to solutions , " merkel said over the weekend after a meeting of her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in berlin to define their room for maneuver on a range of economic and foreign policy issues before the self-imposed nov .
12 deadline to form a " grand coalition " government . wishful thinking ? but merkel 's assumption may just be wishful thinking . most crucial issues , such as reforms of the labor market and the health sector , have so far been dodged .
negotiators have been embroiled instead in debates about tax hikes . in a bid to plug a 43 billion euro -lrb- $ 50 billion -rrb- budget hole by 2007 , the camps have signaled their willingness to increase value-added tax by up to 4 percent .
this may go hand in hand with an extra tax for the wealthy .
there are also plans for a 3 percent increase in income tax for individuals earning more than 250,000 euros a year and families making more than half a million euros per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering is in favor of a tax hike outgoing social democrat chief franz müntefering is one of the staunchest supporters of such a tax hike . " everything is interconnected .
if the burden is to be spread evenly , you simply ca n't exclude the most affluent from the equation , " he said . words of caution against tax hikes but müntefering 's party colleague and state premier in rhineland-palatinate kurt beck warned against jumping the gun .
he said the future government should not repeat the mistakes made in recent decades and put tax hikes before cuts on government spending . " i believe that we should not get distracted from doing things in the right order , " beck said .
" in the talks to come this week , the coalition partners must first concentrate on reducing public spending and cutting obsolete subsidies .
only after this should we resort to tax hikes , including a higher wealth tax , depending on how big the budget hole still is . " cdu unhappy with coalition talks christian democratic state premier in lower saxony christian wulff is displeased with the way coalition talks have been going so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team merkel does n't sound as united as it did some weeks ago he has openly criticized cdu chief angela merkel for sacrificing far too much of the conservatives ' own election manifesto in the talks .
he pointed out that the conservatives wanted to reform the labor market and the social system to make the country competitive again but argued the cdu 's position has been watered down beyond recognition . wulff said that all the current debates about tax hikes are counterproductive . " i think it 's important to see the grand picture , " wulff said . " a higher wealth tax is certainly an option , he said , adding " it 's more important to reduce bureaucracy in the country and provide incentives for a more robust labor market and more efficient industry policy .
and it 's certainly important to reduce spending . " damaging consequences loom whether the negotiating partners will be able to agree on a large-scale reduction of state subsidies is still uncertain . until now , there 's only talk about slashing benefits for private home builders .
but that wo n't do much to fix the budget , as there 's already agreement to spend more elsewhere . there are plans for fresh incentives to boost the economy which will cost billions of euros .
but a failure to fix the budget would have far reaching consequences . should germany not be able to meet eu deficit criteria yet again in 2007 , it 'll have to pay a fine of at least seven billion euros . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder 's mouthpiece speaks out outgoing press spokesman bela anda was the voice of the german federal government - and its firefighter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2005 german president seeks " real partnership " with africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler , right with delegates in bonn german president horst köhler called sunday for a " true partnership " between the west and africa as he kicked off an initiative to solve the continent 's urgent problems . africa has long had relations with western industrial nations , but they 've largely been one-sided so far with the rich west providing development aid to the poorest continent . real equal partnership , which is enshrined in the eighth millennium goal of the united nations , still remains a distant dream .
and that 's exactly where köhler 's " partnership with africa " initiative plans to step in . during a two-day meeting in bonn over the weekend , the german president said that industrialized nations must " finally understand that a partnership will only come about if we respect one another and treat each other equally . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south african president thabo mbeki , left with other african delegates the conference included an illustrious round of invited delegates including former mozambican president joaquim chissano , african union commission chairman alpha ourmar konare and nigerian author and nobel literature laureate wole soyinka . köhler was confident that the international gathering sent an important message . " the conference triggered a clear awareness that we 're dependant on each other .
africa needs support from outside , but europe needs africa as much , " köhler said , citing global environmental problems , aids and the influx of african refugees on european shores as areas where the two needed to cooperate more closely . common interests should dominate the german president urged both sides to carefully consider the term " partnership . " " partnership does n't assume that everything is equal .
there are asymmetrical things , but there has to be a common interest in any case .
both partners must derive advantages from such a relationship , " he said . köhler , a former international monetary fund chief , warned that the west could n't come to africa with a bagful of expectations .
rather it needed to help the continent formulate the right questions and then seek the answers . south african president thabo mbeki called the first " partnership with africa " meeting , aimed at fostering political and economic cooperation between africa and wealthier nations , a good start . mbeki added that bilateral dialogue had to take on a new quality .

today , environmentalists want the former inner-german border turned into a vast green belt . out in the country , the inner-german border was mapped by double fences made of heavy steel mesh and patrolled by armed guards .
at night , anyone who dared enter the forbidden zone risked exposure by motion sensors and automatic search lights , bullets and mines - while regular sweeping of the no-go area meant that footsteps were easily detected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german-german border was a chilling symbol of division almost 1,400 kilometers -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- long and up to 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- wide , the ribbon of land referred to during germany 's division as the death strip was in fact swarming with life . from corridor of death to hub of life dubbed " the green belt " by environmentalists in 1989 , the inner-german border snaking through the country from the baltic coast to the vogtland in saxony forms the backbone of a chain of biotopes that green activists are determined to see preserved .
a swathe of land humans feared to tread , the peace and quiet of the inner-german border provided perfect conditions for animal and plant life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black storks like the quiet life " agricultural cooperatives in east germany were only allowed to farm up to five kilometers from the border , " said jürgen starck , who runs the local branch of friends of the earth in salzwedel in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , which has a 113-kilometer share of the former border . " a lot of rare breeds are refugees from civilization , as it were , like fish otters and black storks , which are much shyer than white storks , and hate any disturbance , " he added .
" they need certain habitats , and the division meant this region is a very well preserved natural habitat . " it 's also home to some exceptional flora . " wild orchids used to be grow across germany , but humans are gradually driving them out with nitrogen fertilizers , " starck said .
" not here .
some of this land is so untouched that wild orchids are a common sight . " healing the scars of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former border near salzwedel " what we do n't want is the sort of nature reserve no one is allowed into , " starck said .
" we want the former inner-german border to be a biotope people can visit .
people should n't forget that this was once a border zone and they should have an opportunity to see how nature responded to the division . " some villages were evacuated and razed , because they were close to the boundary , " he said .
" jahrsau was one of them .
today you can still find a few traces of it , remnants of foundations for example .
it 's incredible to see how an oak tree just grows through what we call civilization , and simply reclaims it , as if history never happened . " an organic iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green belt activists want to see nature bury the past today , germany 's green belt project , the country 's most ambitious single conservation concept , is at the forefront of a continent-spanning scheme to turn the entire iron curtain into a biotope , establishing nature reserves from the finnish-russian border through europe to the bulgarian-greek border . the project took off in 2003 , when jürgen trittin , who was germany 's environment minister at the time , announced that the government had decided to donate the land it owned on the former inner-german border , said liana geidezis from the green belt headquarters in nuremberg .
she added that as a result , germany 's states along the former border were able to use 10,000 hectares - or 65 percent of the entire green belt - for environmental purposes as long as they agreed to participate in the project . obstacles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders inspect their land inevitably , it has n't all been plain-sailing . " the states involved - mecklenburg-western pomerania , brandenburg , saxony , saxony-anhalt , thuringia and lower saxony - have all been profiting from the real estate along the border , " geidezis said .
" according to the wall land act , every time the government sold any of it , proceeds would be ploughed back into a funding scheme , which was distributed among the states and invested into social , cultural and economic projects . " even though the states have mainly welcomed the project , disagreements between cash-strapped regional finance ministries and their environment colleagues have been impossible to avoid .
while the details are being fleshed out , many local activists have started taking matters into their hands . " in salzwedel , friends of the earth decided it would buy up as much private land as possible , while it 's being decided what happens to the state-owned land , " starck said .
" with the help of donations paid by people we like to see as share-holders , we 've now acquired 150 hectares of land . " steeped in symbolism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the healing powers of nature unresolved property claims involving disowned east german land-owners remain a major hurdle .
starck said he also regrets the feet-dragging on the part of the authorities . " the finance ministry in saxony-anhalt , which owns the real estate , is n't always helpful , " he said .
" it 's only interested in money .
it wants trees felled , the land farmed .
it wants it to be profitable . " but he and his fellow ecologists strongly believe their project is as much about preserving germany 's cultural heritage as its unique biotopes . " it 's an extraordinary contradiction , " he said .
" what you see here is the beauty of nature juxtaposed with the horror of what once happened .

several dailies warn that the rest of europe faces similar problems and may not be immune from disturbances .
' contagiousness ' papers in france wonder how the state can restore public order after riots spread from poor paris suburbs to other cities in the country .
a headline in le figaro warns of the " worrying contagiousness " of the unrest .
the paper notes that the riots spread to the provinces over the weekend " despite many calls for calm made by elected representatives and organizations working in the suburbs " .
liberation calls for greater political continuity on law and order .
the paper warns that people 's concerns over whether the state can still guarantee public order could turn into " panic " in the face of a " growing number of extreme acts of violence " .
" and when people feel abandoned like this , it is to be feared that they will show individual or collective reactions aiming to defend their immediate safety through any means necessary , " it says .
the paper argues that both the right and the left have failed to develop a cross-party consensus on long-term law and order policies which " each camp would be able to adjust but not radically call into question " .
le monde says the riots raise doubts about france 's social model .
" in full view of everyone , a country which regards itself as the birthplace of human rights and the sanctuary of a generous social model is proving to be unable to ensure decent living conditions for young french people " who are the descendants of immigrants who contributed to france 's economic success in the post-war period , the paper says .
racial resentment the spanish daily abc says the aim of french prime minister dominique de villepin 's emergency cabinet meeting on saturday was to contain the " shock wave " of violence spreading from paris to the provinces .
the unrest among the immigrant community , says the paper 's sunday edition , has been " ignored for too long " .
" from bordeaux to nice , from strasbourg to rennes , france has been set ablaze by the embers of a racial resentment that the villepin government has been incapable of extinguishing , " it says .

the paper rejects both policing - as advocated by interior minister nicolas sarkozy - and financial measures as solutions .

" in full view of everyone , a country which regards itself as the birthplace of human rights and the sanctuary of a generous social model is proving to be unable to ensure decent living conditions for young french people " who are the descendants of immigrants who contributed to france 's economic success in the post-war period , the paper says .
racial resentment the spanish daily abc says the aim of french prime minister dominique de villepin 's emergency cabinet meeting on saturday was to contain the " shock wave " of violence spreading from paris to the provinces .
the unrest among the immigrant community , says the paper 's sunday edition , has been " ignored for too long " .
" from bordeaux to nice , from strasbourg to rennes , france has been set ablaze by the embers of a racial resentment that the villepin government has been incapable of extinguishing , " it says .
" it is too late to call the firefighters , " the paper concludes .
the basque daily gara , meanwhile , mixes the incendiary metaphor with a medical one .
" in the offices of paris work is under way ... to find an antidote to treat an epidemic that is spreading like wildfire , " says its sunday edition .
the paper rejects both policing - as advocated by interior minister nicolas sarkozy - and financial measures as solutions .
" because it comes too late , an injection of cash into the estates ... may ease the pain but not heal the wound , " it says , pointing out that many of the rioters have turned their backs on the welfare system .
policy ' in ruins ' the czech daily mlada fronta dnes says france 's policy of trying to assimilate immigrants is in ruins .
" all that remains of it after the last few days is smoking car wrecks , burnt-out shops and piles of ashes , " the paper says .
another czech paper , hospodarske noviny , says the problems have been building up for years .
" there has been no agreement whatsoever between big political parties on how to tackle the issue of immigration , " the paper says .
it feels that politicians have vacillated between " investments and subsidies one day and iron rule the next " .
the paper believes that these two approaches merely served to cover up the politicians ' helplessness .
a european strategy ?
germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung sees good and bad in mr sarkozy 's strategy .
the paper says it was unwise of him to make remarks about urban gangs which were " an expression of anger rather than political rationality " .
" but his tactics of restoring law and order first before the problems are tackled is right , " it feels .
berlin 's die tageszeitung says similar riots might well erupt in germany one day .
the paper argues that the impoverishment of " whole sections of the population " is a crucial parallel between the two countries .
" this policy of social apartheid affects primarily , though not exclusively , the descendants of immigrants , " it says .
the paper adds that this policy is currently a " dogma " in the entire eu , but it acknowledges that there are some french specificities .
" in france the ghettos are particularly big and isolated , " it says , " but their inhabitants are all the more self-confident . "
belgium 's de standaard says the riots point to huge challenges ahead .
" what is happening in france provides us with food for thought on the sheer depth of the social problems we face , " the paper says .
it argues that " simple analyses " in terms of racism and multiculturalism will no longer do .
" let us begin by admitting that the challenges are huge , and that we do not even know how to talk to each other , " the paper says .
" if you do not know how wide the river is , you can not build a stable bridge , " it warns .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

gmb union members will vote on whether to take action over the firm 's plan to close its final salary pension scheme to new employees from april 2006 .
national officer brian strutton said he had told british gas of gmb 's intention to ballot 5,500 members over the plan .
he said considering that an " extremely cold " winter was predicted , a quick resolution was needed to the issue .
the engineers , who fit and fix boiler and central heating systems , will vote in the next few weeks , with the result of the ballot expected on 25 november .

seven months ago det supt peter minshall started work as boss of the new counter-terrorism unit at greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- .
the squad comprises 20 officers with a strong track record in cases ranging from organised crime to high profile murders .
west midlands police are following suit and other forces have similar plans .
i do n't want to paint manchester as the centre of all terrorist activity but there 's plenty to do twice in the 1990s manchester was targeted by ira bombs but gmp never had a specialist unit , so why now ?
" our chief constable is very forward thinking , " mr minshall says .
" in the last two or three years we have had a number of terrorist-related investigations where we have to bring together different teams of detectives to investigate .
" but then they go back to their other areas of business .
it seemed to make eminent sense with a number of investigations seemed to make sense to have our own team . "
det con stephen oake was murdered during a terror raid the modern terrorist uses mobile phones , the internet and money laundering techniques similar to organised crime rather than face to face plotting , mr minshall says .
" this a large part of the new face of terrorism compared to what was routine in 1996 , " he said .
" all law enforcement agencies have had to devise new ways of investigating terrorist networks . "
one of the previous terrorist investigations led to the death of det con stephen oake in 2003 .
the special branch officer was stabbed during an operation to arrest terror suspect kamel bourgass , who was jailed for life last year for mr oake 's murder .
and the issue of dealing with potentially dangerous bombers has been thrown into sharper relief with the shooting of an innocent man , jean charles de menezes , on the tube earlier this year .
so would greater manchester officers use lethal force to stop bombers ?
all law enforcement agencies have had to devise new ways of investigating terrorist networks " i am not prepared to answer that , " comes the straight batted reply .
mr minshall is equally cagey when it comes to revealing statistics for arrests or investigations in the unit 's short history .
however he added : " i do n't want to paint manchester as the centre of all terrorist activity but there 's plenty to do . "
but should the people of greater manchester be reassured or concerned that the force has a counter terrorism unit ? "
we 're there to deal with and investigate people we suspect to be terrorists - we are developing an expertise and we feel more able as a force to deal with these people properly - i would hope people are reassured . "

the royal national institute for the blind 's talking book service pioneered the use of long-playing records in the 1920s , long before the music industry .
two million talking books are now issued every year , mostly on cd .
the most requested author is catherine cookson and her novel , fenwick house , is the most popular title .
trail-blazing service the talking book service has its origins in the first world war .
many soldiers returning from the front were blinded in action and found it too difficult to learn braille .
as early as 1920 , the rnib began testing various formats to produce talking books .
in pictures : history of talking books by 1926 the organisation was experimenting with long-playing records which could be played on gramophones .
it was thanks to the rnib 's trail blazing that lps were eventually adopted by the music industry .
but it took until the mid-thirties before the talking book service was launched .
on november 7 1935 , blind and partially sighted people had a choice of two titles - agatha christie 's the murder of roger ackroyd and joseph conrad 's typhoon .
the early books were recorded onto 12 inch discs which played at 24rpm .
this meant that 25 minutes of audio could be recorded onto each side and a typical novel would fit onto 10 double-sided records .
the post office granted the rnib a concessionary postage rate to keep costs down , and the society of authors and the society of publishers helped to overcome copyright problems .
under fire the new service suffered a major setback during word war two when its recording studio and production unit were bombed in 1940 .
a temporary studio suffered a similar fate some months later .
the rnib had close links with the american foundation for the blind which was also producing audio books .
the afb sent a wartime gift of half a million gramophone needles to the rnib but these were destroyed in bombing raids on the docks .
fortunately , another consignment was sent and arrived safely .
in 1960 a new talking book player was launched which played tape cassettes .
but these were so large that they had to be delivered separately from the rest of the mail , and were too big to fit into a post box .
the cassettes contained several hours ' of audio recorded onto separate tracks .
although books were now available to thousands of blind and partially sighted people , the players were large and heavy and often broke down .
digital future by the late 1990s the rnib started to look at ways of producing audio books in digital format , and consulted organisations in other countries to agree a common standard .
what emerged was daisy -lrb- digital accessible information system -rrb- , which allowed several hours of audio to be recorded onto a single cd .
the first daisy books were sent out in 2002 and could only be played on special cd players .
a new range of small , clamshell daisy players now makes audio reading as convenient as print - on a train , during a long haul flight , on the beach or while waiting to see the doctor .
the talking book service now has the largest collection of unabridged audio books in the uk .
it contains more than 10,000 titles including thrillers , travel , romance , sci-fi and poetry .
talking books cost around £ 2,500 to produce and take five days to record .
and the rnib says the technical innovation will continue .
as the number of portable devices capable of playing audio multiplies , the organisation is now investigating ways of making books available electronically .

in the first six months of the enough campaign , in berwick , northumberland , alcohol-related violent crime fell by 47 % and there were no serious assaults .
there is a heavy police presence in the town 's pubs and clubs each weekend and officers talk to drinkers .
now other rural areas are looking at what has been done in berwick and whether it could be used as a model .
insp martin baylis , from berwick police , said there was a two-stage approach to their work at the weekends .
unacceptable behaviour on friday and saturday evenings , extra officers go to underage drinking hotspots where they speak to young people , confiscate alcohol and take them home if appropriate , and parents are informed .
he said the idea was to involve parents and the education and health networks so they could work together to tackle the problem .
in the second part , officers visit pubs and speak to licensees and look for people getting excessively drunk and boisterous and tell them their behaviour is not acceptable .
he said : " what we are doing is making them aware that their behaviour is unacceptable and it is n't going to be tolerated in berwick where you can come and have a good night out , behave responsibly , really enjoy yourselves in a safe environment . "
berwick community safety officer gerald connor said it was a long-term programme and there had been inquiries about it from other rural communities .
