the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .
as for bernd walter , his dreams of seeing his dancers take center stage - for longer than 45 seconds - have not yet entirely been dashed .
" i hope the last word has n't been spoken on this , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

as he governs with a grand coalition of spd and cdu in his state , he is also well prepared to take part in grand coalition talks on the national level . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they will work together , after all : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and müntefering müntefering , 65 , lost an internal party power struggle and said he would not seek to become leader again when the party holds an extraordinary congress in karlsruhe on nov .
14-16 . he will , however , serve as vice-chancellor and labor minister in the next cabinet , should a grand coalition become reality .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber meanwhile announced that he will not come to berlin to serve as economics minister and instead stay in munich . platzeck , who is close to outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , was likely to be ratified as leader when the party leadership meets on wednesday afternoon .
he would become the first spd leader from the former east germany . heali n g the wou n ds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd is hoping that the party leadership storm is now over many observers and spd insiders see platzeck as the best candidate to bridge the ever widening rift between the spd left-wing and centrist factions and help revitalize the party along the way . " we agreed that we should really use the chance , which is hidden in this crisis , for a visible and energetic rejuvenation , " said parliament vice-president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- . " it is a great honor for me , " platzeck told reporters , adding that his appointment would not disallow müntefering from becoming vice-chancellor in a merkel-led government . " we want negotiations on building a government to move ahead swiftly , " platzeck said . more trouble for a n gela ? merkel sought to downplay the impact the turmoil in the spd may have on the coalition , saying : " as leader of the cdu -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , i have lived through worse situations , " she said .
" i sense a desire in the spd to continue the talks on forming a grand coalition .
based on that , i am still assuming we can bring these talks to a successful conclusion . " but leading conservatives said that the already daunting task of arranging an improbable pairing of germany 's two biggest political rivals - last tried in the 1960s - had become incalculably more difficult . " at the moment , we can not say whether there will , or will not , be a grand coalition , " cdu deputy leader jürgen rüttgers told public television . " the spd must now say what it wants . " sigmar gabriel as secretary ge n eral ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel : the next spd secretary general ?
müntefering 's bombshell resignation on monday came after his hand-picked candidate for spd general secretary lost a vote with the party 's board to maverick left-winger andrea nahles . recognizing the political tornado she had wrought , nahles , 35 , told german radio she would consider withdrawing her candidacy when it is voted on at a party congress in two weeks . political analysts said platzeck was unlikely to want nahles on his team , and the name of sigmar gabriel , 46 , the likely environment minister in the coalition government was circulating late tuesday as a possible candidate to fill the secretary general 's position . the more conservative circles in the spd are also staunch opponents of nahles ' nomination . " i think it would be absurd to reward somebody for regicide , for being stubborn and throwing the party into a crisis , " said johannes kahrs , an spd parliamentarian from the party 's right wing . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition government in doubt as spd undergoes shakeup the surprise announcement of the resignation of spd chief franz müntefering has thrown the future of a left-right coalition government into doubt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2005 opinion : europe wakes up to multicultural realities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gogh 's murder was horrifying , but some good could come of it the dutch filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam on nov .
2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2005 matthias platzeck : quiet leader catapulted into the spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the somewhat retiring platzeck will be at center stage from now on germany ’ s social democrats have formally nominated brandenburg premier matthias platzeck as the new man at the helm of the party .
the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all .

that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .

as he governs with a grand coalition of spd and cdu in his state , he is also well prepared to take part in grand coalition talks on the national level . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they will work together , after all : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and müntefering müntefering , 65 , lost an internal party power struggle and said he would not seek to become leader again when the party holds an extraordinary congress in karlsruhe on nov .
14-16 . he will , however , serve as vice-chancellor and labor minister in the next cabinet , should a grand coalition become reality .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber meanwhile announced that he will not come to berlin to serve as economics minister and instead stay in munich . platzeck , who is close to outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , was likely to be ratified as leader when the party leadership meets on wednesday afternoon .
he would become the first spd leader from the former east germany . heali n g the wou n ds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd is hoping that the party leadership storm is now over many observers and spd insiders see platzeck as the best candidate to bridge the ever widening rift between the spd left-wing and centrist factions and help revitalize the party along the way . " we agreed that we should really use the chance , which is hidden in this crisis , for a visible and energetic rejuvenation , " said parliament vice-president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- . " it is a great honor for me , " platzeck told reporters , adding that his appointment would not disallow müntefering from becoming vice-chancellor in a merkel-led government . " we want negotiations on building a government to move ahead swiftly , " platzeck said . more trouble for a n gela ? merkel sought to downplay the impact the turmoil in the spd may have on the coalition , saying : " as leader of the cdu -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , i have lived through worse situations , " she said .
" i sense a desire in the spd to continue the talks on forming a grand coalition .
based on that , i am still assuming we can bring these talks to a successful conclusion . " but leading conservatives said that the already daunting task of arranging an improbable pairing of germany 's two biggest political rivals - last tried in the 1960s - had become incalculably more difficult .

müntefering 's bombshell resignation on monday came after his hand-picked candidate for spd general secretary lost a vote with the party 's board to maverick left-winger andrea nahles . recognizing the political tornado she had wrought , nahles , 35 , told german radio she would consider withdrawing her candidacy when it is voted on at a party congress in two weeks . political analysts said platzeck was unlikely to want nahles on his team , and the name of sigmar gabriel , 46 , the likely environment minister in the coalition government was circulating late tuesday as a possible candidate to fill the secretary general 's position . the more conservative circles in the spd are also staunch opponents of nahles ' nomination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2005 opinion : europe wakes up to multicultural realities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gogh 's murder was horrifying , but some good could come of it the dutch filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam on nov .
2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2005 matthias platzeck : quiet leader catapulted into the spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the somewhat retiring platzeck will be at center stage from now on germany ’ s social democrats have formally nominated brandenburg premier matthias platzeck as the new man at the helm of the party .
the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

2 , 2005 -rrb- coalition government in doubt as spd undergoes shakeup the surprise announcement of the resignation of spd chief franz müntefering has thrown the future of a left-right coalition government into doubt .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2005 opinion : europe wakes up to multicultural realities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gogh 's murder was horrifying , but some good could come of it the dutch filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam on nov .
2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed .

in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .
as for bernd walter , his dreams of seeing his dancers take center stage - for longer than 45 seconds - have not yet entirely been dashed .
" i hope the last word has n't been spoken on this , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

" i have decided to end my mandate immediately , " he told the weekly jüdische allgemeine wochenzeitung .
meyer , a lawyer who has held the post since january 2004 and has been seen as a liberal , said that " some people put their own interests and pride above the good of the community . " experts on jewish matters said on wednesday that the struggle had nothing to do with religious ideology but with cultural differences , while the daily berliner zeitung spoke of a " german-russian tragedy " pitting immigrants from the former soviet union against other members of the community . cultural differences ? ex-soviet jews have in recent years made up the majority of the 12,000 members of the berlin community .
they enjoyed nearly unrestricted residence rights in germany after the fall of the iron curtain as the government sought to atone in some measure for the mass killing of jews during the nazi era . however , complaints have arisen in recent years from german jewish organizations that some immigrants had doubtful jewish ancestry and liberal and secular traditions that clashed with those of more orthodox german jews . the government last year introduced tougher requirements for jewish immigrants from the old soviet bloc , including proof of their ancestry and the ability to speak german . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish paper aims for german audience jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2005 opinion : europe wakes up to multicultural realities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gogh 's murder was horrifying , but some good could come of it the dutch filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam on nov .
2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .

as he governs with a grand coalition of spd and cdu in his state , he is also well prepared to take part in grand coalition talks on the national level . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they will work together , after all : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and müntefering müntefering , 65 , lost an internal party power struggle and said he would not seek to become leader again when the party holds an extraordinary congress in karlsruhe on nov .
14-16 . he will , however , serve as vice-chancellor and labor minister in the next cabinet , should a grand coalition become reality .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber meanwhile announced that he will not come to berlin to serve as economics minister and instead stay in munich . platzeck , who is close to outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder , was likely to be ratified as leader when the party leadership meets on wednesday afternoon .
he would become the first spd leader from the former east germany . heali n g the wou n ds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd is hoping that the party leadership storm is now over many observers and spd insiders see platzeck as the best candidate to bridge the ever widening rift between the spd left-wing and centrist factions and help revitalize the party along the way . " we agreed that we should really use the chance , which is hidden in this crisis , for a visible and energetic rejuvenation , " said parliament vice-president wolfgang thierse -lrb- spd -rrb- . " it is a great honor for me , " platzeck told reporters , adding that his appointment would not disallow müntefering from becoming vice-chancellor in a merkel-led government . " we want negotiations on building a government to move ahead swiftly , " platzeck said . more trouble for a n gela ? merkel sought to downplay the impact the turmoil in the spd may have on the coalition , saying : " as leader of the cdu -lrb- christian democratic union -rrb- , i have lived through worse situations , " she said .
" i sense a desire in the spd to continue the talks on forming a grand coalition .
based on that , i am still assuming we can bring these talks to a successful conclusion .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .
as for bernd walter , his dreams of seeing his dancers take center stage - for longer than 45 seconds - have not yet entirely been dashed .
" i hope the last word has n't been spoken on this , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

" i have decided to end my mandate immediately , " he told the weekly jüdische allgemeine wochenzeitung .
meyer , a lawyer who has held the post since january 2004 and has been seen as a liberal , said that " some people put their own interests and pride above the good of the community . " experts on jewish matters said on wednesday that the struggle had nothing to do with religious ideology but with cultural differences , while the daily berliner zeitung spoke of a " german-russian tragedy " pitting immigrants from the former soviet union against other members of the community . cultural differences ? ex-soviet jews have in recent years made up the majority of the 12,000 members of the berlin community .
they enjoyed nearly unrestricted residence rights in germany after the fall of the iron curtain as the government sought to atone in some measure for the mass killing of jews during the nazi era . however , complaints have arisen in recent years from german jewish organizations that some immigrants had doubtful jewish ancestry and liberal and secular traditions that clashed with those of more orthodox german jews . the government last year introduced tougher requirements for jewish immigrants from the old soviet bloc , including proof of their ancestry and the ability to speak german . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish paper aims for german audience jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2005 matthias platzeck : quiet leader catapulted into the spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the somewhat retiring platzeck will be at center stage from now on germany ’ s social democrats have formally nominated brandenburg premier matthias platzeck as the new man at the helm of the party .
the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .

the spd has said that it does not intend to go back on past agreements which foresee the complete phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 , but the issue has not yet been completely settled in the ongoing coalition discussions with the cdu . environmental groups have welcomed the news that has emerged so far from the talks .
a draft coalition deal obtained by reuters revealed that the government aims to maintain its current commitment to the promotion of renewable energy and will leave all existing legislation in place until 2008 . but in a press conference on tuesday , representatives from the german branch of friends of the earth and other environmental organizations , including greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , drew attention to issues that have yet to be addressed , such as government policy on genetically modified crops , the promotion of more ecological forms of transport and maintenance of the country 's nature reserves . keeping gm crops under control brigitte behrens , head of greenpeace germany , called for the issue of genetic technology not to fall under the responsibility of the ministry for economics .

" experts on jewish matters said on wednesday that the struggle had nothing to do with religious ideology but with cultural differences , while the daily berliner zeitung spoke of a " german-russian tragedy " pitting immigrants from the former soviet union against other members of the community . cultural differences ? ex-soviet jews have in recent years made up the majority of the 12,000 members of the berlin community .
they enjoyed nearly unrestricted residence rights in germany after the fall of the iron curtain as the government sought to atone in some measure for the mass killing of jews during the nazi era . however , complaints have arisen in recent years from german jewish organizations that some immigrants had doubtful jewish ancestry and liberal and secular traditions that clashed with those of more orthodox german jews . the government last year introduced tougher requirements for jewish immigrants from the old soviet bloc , including proof of their ancestry and the ability to speak german . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish paper aims for german audience jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2005 matthias platzeck : quiet leader catapulted into the spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the somewhat retiring platzeck will be at center stage from now on germany ’ s social democrats have formally nominated brandenburg premier matthias platzeck as the new man at the helm of the party .
the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .

2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .
as for bernd walter , his dreams of seeing his dancers take center stage - for longer than 45 seconds - have not yet entirely been dashed .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .

the spd has said that it does not intend to go back on past agreements which foresee the complete phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 , but the issue has not yet been completely settled in the ongoing coalition discussions with the cdu . environmental groups have welcomed the news that has emerged so far from the talks .
a draft coalition deal obtained by reuters revealed that the government aims to maintain its current commitment to the promotion of renewable energy and will leave all existing legislation in place until 2008 . but in a press conference on tuesday , representatives from the german branch of friends of the earth and other environmental organizations , including greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , drew attention to issues that have yet to be addressed , such as government policy on genetically modified crops , the promotion of more ecological forms of transport and maintenance of the country 's nature reserves . keeping gm crops under control brigitte behrens , head of greenpeace germany , called for the issue of genetic technology not to fall under the responsibility of the ministry for economics . " the spd promised that genetically modified foods would not gain back door entry to germany 's agricultural economy , " she said .
" that would spell the end of organic farming in germany . " angelika zahrnt , chairwoman of friends of the earth germany , called for the new government to reassess its subsidies program . " subsidies that are damaging for the environment should not be part of the new government 's budget , " zahrnt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new agreement could help push the development of greener fuels she called on peer steinbrück , the spd politician designated to be the next environment minister , to protect the environment and save money at the same time by introducing a tax on kerosene and reducing by half the current tax break given to german commuters . to encourage german carmakers to be faster about bringing more environmentally-friendly models on the market , zahrnt appealed to future transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- to introduce a motor vehicle tax based on the level of carbon dioxide emissions . according to the draft coalition deal , the new government is already considering making it necessary for fuel to contain " green " ingredients such as ethanol . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set to clash over nuclear power the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .
he ’ ll have to mend the rift between the left and right wings of the party , especially as the spd is engaged in difficult coalition negotiations with the conservatives .
platzeck is a friendly , mild-mannered man who is not known to have any enemies .
" it 's hard to find anything to criticize him about because he 's hardly ever said anything that could be criticized , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" unless he really messes up now , he 'll be the spd chancellor candidate in four years . "
positive qualities his supporters say he is not one to avoid confrontation over important political issues .
he proved himself to be an effective manager after his steady handling of relief efforts during devastating floods in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering is the latest who has walked away from the top post he will need those qualities , since he is entering a position which has a history of getting the best of even highly skilled politicians .
since 1987 , eight men have led the social democrats .
his rise to the top means that , for the first time , two easterners will lead germany 's two largest parties .
chancellor-designate angela merkel , also 51 , grew up just north of berlin .
platzeck , a divorced father of three daughters , resembles merkel in that he appears to lack political arrogance but is a savvy player behind the scenes .
unlike merkel , though , he is able to use his somewhat home-spun character to connect with voters .
" it ’ s good for politicians to remember who they ’ re supposed to serve and that they ’ re not almighty and the only wise guys around , ” he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de platzeck to become spd leader brandenburg premier matthias platzeck announced he had won enough support to lead the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- party , effectively ending a crisis after party chief franz müntefering decided to step down .

the 51-year-old has experienced an astonishing , and high-speed , rise to the top . the post of social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- chief had to be filled again when franz müntefering announced his resignation from the top job after his hand-picked candidate for the post of general secretary was voted down by the party executive .
the step triggered a leadership crisis and party leaders were left scrambling to fill müntefering 's capable and experienced shoes .
the position is to be filled by matthias platzeck , whose nomination on wednesday comes with high expectations .
the spd needs a strong leader to keep sometimes-warring internal factions in line and navigate the tricky waters that are sure to come if the spd enters into a governing coalition with the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , 51 , has three daughters “ i ’ d be very pleased , if i received the support of delegates at our conference in two weeks ’ time and would certainly devote all my energy to the social democratic party , " platzeck said .
born in potsdam in then-communist east germany , 51-year-old platzeck has only been a member of the spd for 10 years .
his fast-moving political career only began after german unification and today he enjoys widespread support from all wings of his party , a rarity among spd politicians these days .
a star in brandenburg platzeck served as brandenburg 's environmental minister from 1990 to 1998 and was elected premier of the largely rural , relatively poor eastern state in 2002 .
while other spd state premiers were losing elections across the country , platzeck defied the trend , largely by being honest with the citizens there about the region 's stagnant economy .
such forthrightness was appreciated and he is still very popular .
he turned down the jobs of foreign minister and vice chancellor only weeks ago because he said he did not want to leave the voters in brandenburg .
" party chairman is an honorary post , and i ’ m not going to neglect my main job as state premier of brandenburg , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd headquarters in berlin but political observers doubt whether platzeck will be able to shoulder both tasks satisfactorily , considering the difficult phase germany ’ s social democrats are going through .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all .

the organizers of the world cup 2006 opening ceremonies have limited the folk dancers ' appearance to just 45 seconds . a row that has erupted between world cup organizers and representatives from the bavarian folk scene is threatening to leave the soccer tournament 's opening ceremonies on june 9 in munich completely devoid of trachtler - those lederhosen-wearing , thigh-slapping dancers that have come to embody southern german culture . moving to the tight pace of television , those at the helm of the opening ceremonies have decreed that the folk dancers should get a mere 45 seconds in the limelight - hardly enough time to do the art form justice , the irate deputy president of the bavarian folk dancing association fumed . " we wo n't allow ourselves to be made fools of , " bernd walter said .
" if they do n't give us any longer , we simply wo n't take part . " no women allowed adding insult to injury , the folk dancers have also had to swallow the news that their dirndl-clad female counterparts wo n't be allowed to take part at all . " the girls take up too much space , so they wo n't be permitted to perform , " sepp lausch of the folk dancing association told munich 's abendzeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's trachtler are prepared to walk if they do n't get more air time the organizers have argued that , as the world cup is being hosted by all of germany , it would be unfair to give the bavarian dancers a starring role in the opening ceremonies .
that view has not gone down well with fiercely proud bavarian people .
in a recent poll for bavarian state radio , 70 percent of those surveyed said that since the celebrations were happening in munich , they ought to have an overtly bavarian theme . the world cup organizers have appealed for calm from the angry dancers , saying that nothing concrete has been decided yet and that many options are still being discussed .
as for bernd walter , his dreams of seeing his dancers take center stage - for longer than 45 seconds - have not yet entirely been dashed .
" i hope the last word has n't been spoken on this , " walter said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grab your steins , it 's oktoberfest time for many , the german election this weekend was way down the list of priorities as the oktoberfest beer festival roared to life once more in munich with 17 days of alcoholic revelry on the schedule .

the spd has said that it does not intend to go back on past agreements which foresee the complete phase-out of nuclear power by 2020 , but the issue has not yet been completely settled in the ongoing coalition discussions with the cdu . environmental groups have welcomed the news that has emerged so far from the talks .
a draft coalition deal obtained by reuters revealed that the government aims to maintain its current commitment to the promotion of renewable energy and will leave all existing legislation in place until 2008 . but in a press conference on tuesday , representatives from the german branch of friends of the earth and other environmental organizations , including greenpeace and the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , drew attention to issues that have yet to be addressed , such as government policy on genetically modified crops , the promotion of more ecological forms of transport and maintenance of the country 's nature reserves . keeping gm crops under control brigitte behrens , head of greenpeace germany , called for the issue of genetic technology not to fall under the responsibility of the ministry for economics . " the spd promised that genetically modified foods would not gain back door entry to germany 's agricultural economy , " she said .
" that would spell the end of organic farming in germany . " angelika zahrnt , chairwoman of friends of the earth germany , called for the new government to reassess its subsidies program . " subsidies that are damaging for the environment should not be part of the new government 's budget , " zahrnt said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new agreement could help push the development of greener fuels she called on peer steinbrück , the spd politician designated to be the next environment minister , to protect the environment and save money at the same time by introducing a tax on kerosene and reducing by half the current tax break given to german commuters . to encourage german carmakers to be faster about bringing more environmentally-friendly models on the market , zahrnt appealed to future transport minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- spd -rrb- to introduce a motor vehicle tax based on the level of carbon dioxide emissions . according to the draft coalition deal , the new government is already considering making it necessary for fuel to contain " green " ingredients such as ethanol . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set to clash over nuclear power the future of nuclear energy is set to be a key battlefield in talks between germany 's potential coalition partners with both bracing for a showdown over the emotive issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.11.2005 opinion : europe wakes up to multicultural realities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gogh 's murder was horrifying , but some good could come of it the dutch filmmaker theo van gogh was murdered in amsterdam on nov .
2 , 2004 .
his murderer , mohamed bouyeri , said he killed in the name of islam .
many saw the idea of a multicultural society irreparably damaged . the murder one year ago of the controversial filmmaker by a dutch-moroccan man who said he killed in the name of islam unleashed a shock wave in the netherlands , which both overturned comfortable notions about that country 's society and resulted in attacks on mosques and other muslim facilities .
the unease also reached germany , which , although not directly affected , was greatly haunted by an event that seemed so unlikely for the country next door , seen by many as a role model for tolerance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man passes by a memorial to dutch filmmaker theo van gogh many were certain that along with the death of van gogh , a highly visible " agent provocateur , " the myth of the multicultural society had died as well .
it was a myth that the dutch had long and successfully tended and which was observed with some jealously by the germans .
the thinking was often : if only we had that here .
worst fears have n't surfaced but one year after the murder , the prophecies of doom that coursed through the media and society have gotten quieter .
not because it has been an easy year : the terrorist attacks on the london subway system forced the recognition that radical behavior and terrorism are not only phenomena in far off afghanistan or the euphrates .
more recently , new unrest has broken out in france after panicked young muslims , allegedly being chased by police , were electrocuted in a power substation .
despite those events , the murder on an amsterdam street has perhaps had the opposite effect of what was feared .
the horrible event has led to new reflections about europe , namely , that western european society has been multicultural for a long time and is going to stay that way .
active efforts needed there has also been a realization that success in both living together in such a society and in integrating immigrants does not happen all by itself .
it requires the active , and most importantly , willing participation of all parties involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parallel societies or integration of different traditions ?
the majority population will not be able to simply ignore or talk away the appearance of so-called parallel societies .
only when one actively strives toward integrating immigrants will societal and cultural isolation be lessened .
that is no easy task and requires openness and tolerance toward people of different colors , beliefs and languages .
even the second and third generations of immigrants need respect and attention .
the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .
those who want to live in a " foreign " country for the long term have to learn to overcome this sense of " foreignness " by getting to know the country better and trying to integrate into its society .
" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

-lrb- july 26 , 2005 -rrb- hate-preachers can expect prosecution preachers of religious hatred , most notably imams , frequently escape prosecution for their " opinions , " but what can german prosecutors do when christian preachers do the same ?

the murder of van gogh and the attacks on london , carried out by people who lived for a long time or were even born in europe , have made that very clear .
but immigrants have to contribute to this goal as well .

" integrating " should not and can not mean dissolving completely into the melting pot .
the right to cultural and religious traditions is inalienable and must be protected by law , but they can not stand above the law .
these reflections are not new , but they have been brought back into the spotlight in the year since van gogh 's murder .
instead of burying the multicultural society , such thinking is a good start on the path of making long-known , but long-suppressed truths a daily reality . peter philipp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de van gogh murderer sentenced to life a dutch court condemned mohammed bouyeri to life in jail on tuesday .

mr mcletchie was caught up in a row over his expenses claims after the freedom of information commissioner ruled that they should be made public .
officials are considering publishing regular updates of every detail of holyrood expenses on the internet .
but many msps are concerned it could jeopardise their personal security .
following the controversy surrounding mr mcletchie , freedom of information expense requests have been made for every msp dating back to 1999 .
officials said the task involved tens of thousands of pages which would take nine months to complete .
they have been asked to produce an action plan on the best way of publishing msps ' allowances going back to the start of the scottish parliament .
more reporting a group made up of msps and parliamentary staff would now be set up to consider options for making improvements , holyrood 's presiding officer george reid said .
in a letter to msps , mr reid said holyrood 's management team , the scottish parliament corporate body -lrb- spcb -rrb- , believed there should be a move from annual to more frequent reporting of msps ' allowances .
he stated : " exactly how that will operate requires careful consideration , in particular of the resources required . "
we recognise that there are issues of personal security george reid presiding officer many msps , particularly women , are known to be concerned that publishing details such as frequently visited addresses could put their personal safety and privacy at risk .
mr reid said : " we recognise that there are issues of personal security , bank accounts and third parties which need to be addressed .
" we also recognise that our reporting systems , and the role of staff in processing returns in a focussed way , need to be reformed .
" if we are to require journey claims showing time , date , departure and arrival point and purpose , for example , that will require new electronic formats which are common to everyone . "
although the spcb recommended resorting to fuller disclosure " at the earliest practical time " , mr reid warned the move would take time because of a need for external advice and internal consultation .
mr reid added that freedom of information -lrb- foi -rrb- laws had gone a considerable way in changing the culture of public life in scotland .

mr mcletchie was caught up in a row over his expenses claims after the freedom of information commissioner ruled that they should be made public .
officials are considering publishing regular updates of every detail of holyrood expenses on the internet .
but many msps are concerned it could jeopardise their personal security .
following the controversy surrounding mr mcletchie , freedom of information expense requests have been made for every msp dating back to 1999 .
officials said the task involved tens of thousands of pages which would take nine months to complete .
they have been asked to produce an action plan on the best way of publishing msps ' allowances going back to the start of the scottish parliament .
more reporting a group made up of msps and parliamentary staff would now be set up to consider options for making improvements , holyrood 's presiding officer george reid said .
in a letter to msps , mr reid said holyrood 's management team , the scottish parliament corporate body -lrb- spcb -rrb- , believed there should be a move from annual to more frequent reporting of msps ' allowances .
he stated : " exactly how that will operate requires careful consideration , in particular of the resources required . "
we recognise that there are issues of personal security george reid presiding officer many msps , particularly women , are known to be concerned that publishing details such as frequently visited addresses could put their personal safety and privacy at risk .
mr reid said : " we recognise that there are issues of personal security , bank accounts and third parties which need to be addressed .
" we also recognise that our reporting systems , and the role of staff in processing returns in a focussed way , need to be reformed .
" if we are to require journey claims showing time , date , departure and arrival point and purpose , for example , that will require new electronic formats which are common to everyone . "
although the spcb recommended resorting to fuller disclosure " at the earliest practical time " , mr reid warned the move would take time because of a need for external advice and internal consultation .
mr reid added that freedom of information -lrb- foi -rrb- laws had gone a considerable way in changing the culture of public life in scotland .

the cuffs were allegedly used by bradley murdoch , 47 , who is accused of killing miss lees ' boyfriend peter falconio , 28 , during an ambush in 2001 .
he denies murder and the assault and kidnap of miss lees , 32 , of brighton .
forensic biologist carmen eckhoff told the court laboratory director dr peter thatcher 's dna was found on the cuffs .
she said the presence of his dna on the " significant " piece of evidence could have got there in a number of ways , despite protocols being in place to prevent it happening .
during cross-examination by defence lawyer grant algie , ms eckhoff said she did not know how dr thatcher 's dna came to be on the exhibit .
i was unhappy about -lsb- the cuffs -rsb- leaving my possession , particularly if the forensic examination may not have been completed forensic biologist carmen eckhoff " i was not there when he was handling it , but i 'm aware he was handling it on a number of occasions , " she said .
on friday defence barristers told the court that police may have contaminated the handcuffs , saying they were photographed next to tape found at the home of the suspect .
in other dna evidence the jury heard on tuesday that blood on miss lees ' t-shirt was 150 million billion times more likely to be bradley murdoch 's than any other local white male 's .
it is alleged mr murdoch flagged down the couple 's camper van on a remote highway in the outback , shot mr falconio and attacked miss lees .
the court earlier heard miss lees escaped and hid " like a rabbit " for five hours in scrub , before being rescued .
mr falconio 's body has never been found .
sealed bag when asked in court on wednesday about the cable bindings ms eckhoff said she asked dr thatcher - director of the forensic science laboratory - how his dna came to be there and that he provided an explanation .
prosecutor anthony elliott objected when mr algie asked what that explanation was .
he again objected when mr algie asked which protocol dr thatcher may have broken .
mr algie asked the prosecution to call dr thatcher as a witness later in the trial .
ms eckhoff said dr thatcher had the cable ties signed out to him on three occasions in 2001 and 2002 .
during cross-examination ms eckhoff said she did not agree with the cable ties being taken to yatala prison in adelaide , south australia , where mr murdoch was on remand in october 2002 .
mr falconio 's body has never been found " i was unhappy about them leaving my possession , particularly if the forensic examination may not have been completed . "
she made her feelings known to dr thatcher , who gave the handcuffs to senior constable tim sandry so he could take them to adelaide .
earlier , ms eckhoff said that if anyone wanted to continue testing an item , such as the cable ties , it was " not ideal " to take them out of the laboratory .
but she said that if they remained in a sealed bag and were put in the same room as mr murdoch 's items , or mr murdoch himself - as they were when police visited yatala prison - they would not be contaminated as long as the bag was not opened .
when asked about the possibility of deliberate contamination of the cable ties with mr murdoch 's dna she said that the samples from him that were stored in the freezer were of a very high concentration .
she said it was only possible to find dna on the cable ties by using a method called " low copy number " because there was very little present .
the trial continues .

during cross-examination by defence lawyer grant algie , ms eckhoff said she did not know how dr thatcher 's dna came to be on the exhibit .
i was unhappy about -lsb- the cuffs -rsb- leaving my possession , particularly if the forensic examination may not have been completed forensic biologist carmen eckhoff " i was not there when he was handling it , but i 'm aware he was handling it on a number of occasions , " she said .
on friday defence barristers told the court that police may have contaminated the handcuffs , saying they were photographed next to tape found at the home of the suspect .
in other dna evidence the jury heard on tuesday that blood on miss lees ' t-shirt was 150 million billion times more likely to be bradley murdoch 's than any other local white male 's .
it is alleged mr murdoch flagged down the couple 's camper van on a remote highway in the outback , shot mr falconio and attacked miss lees .
the court earlier heard miss lees escaped and hid " like a rabbit " for five hours in scrub , before being rescued .
mr falconio 's body has never been found .
sealed bag when asked in court on wednesday about the cable bindings ms eckhoff said she asked dr thatcher - director of the forensic science laboratory - how his dna came to be there and that he provided an explanation .
prosecutor anthony elliott objected when mr algie asked what that explanation was .
he again objected when mr algie asked which protocol dr thatcher may have broken .
mr algie asked the prosecution to call dr thatcher as a witness later in the trial .
ms eckhoff said dr thatcher had the cable ties signed out to him on three occasions in 2001 and 2002 .
during cross-examination ms eckhoff said she did not agree with the cable ties being taken to yatala prison in adelaide , south australia , where mr murdoch was on remand in october 2002 .
mr falconio 's body has never been found " i was unhappy about them leaving my possession , particularly if the forensic examination may not have been completed . "
she made her feelings known to dr thatcher , who gave the handcuffs to senior constable tim sandry so he could take them to adelaide .
earlier , ms eckhoff said that if anyone wanted to continue testing an item , such as the cable ties , it was " not ideal " to take them out of the laboratory .
but she said that if they remained in a sealed bag and were put in the same room as mr murdoch 's items , or mr murdoch himself - as they were when police visited yatala prison - they would not be contaminated as long as the bag was not opened .
when asked about the possibility of deliberate contamination of the cable ties with mr murdoch 's dna she said that the samples from him that were stored in the freezer were of a very high concentration .
she said it was only possible to find dna on the cable ties by using a method called " low copy number " because there was very little present .
the trial continues .

mr howard said he could give no further details , for operational reasons .
he said the senate would be recalled to pass an amendment to existing anti-terror laws , relating to the description of a particular action .
mr howard 's government hopes to introduce tough new counter-terrorism legislation by christmas .
but those plans have been delayed in parliament because of concern among some state leaders that the new laws threaten civil liberties .
' cause of concern ' australia has not experienced a major terrorist attack on its soil , although australians overseas have been targeted in blasts in indonesia .
mr howard told reporters in canberra the government had received information which gave " cause for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat " .
" we have seen material .
it is a cause of concern , " he said .
but he said the current security alert would not be upgraded .
mr howard said the proposed amendment would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to protect australians .
the change was approved by the house of representatives on wednesday , and the upper house senate would be recalled on thursday to pass it into law , he said .
the amendment will replace the word " the " with " a " in the definition of a terrorism offence , to clarify that it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act .
it would mean that people could be charged for considering a terrorist attack , even if they had not yet decided on its timing and location .
mr howard 's announcement came a day after the nation 's domestic intelligence service warned in its annual general report to parliament of a threat of home-grown terrorists .
reforms row the amendment comes as the federal and state governments negotiate a larger package of anti-terror measures .
the government needs the support of the states - all run by the opposition labor party - to enforce the measures .
state leaders , who backed the bill last month but have yet to agree a detailed draft , fear it could threaten civil liberties and breach the constitution .
the law would allow terror suspects to be held without charge for 14 days .
the most controversial element is a shoot-to-kill provision , giving police officers the right to use lethal force in the pursuit of suspected terrorists .
the leaders of australia 's eight states and territories said in september they would back the law , in return for a promise from mr howard that the measures be reviewed after five years .
however , mr howard has been accused of trying to push through the legislation too quickly .
muslim leaders have also expressed fears that the laws could spread intolerance .

mr howard said he could give no further details , for operational reasons .
he said the senate would be recalled to pass an amendment to existing anti-terror laws , relating to the description of a particular action .
mr howard 's government hopes to introduce tough new counter-terrorism legislation by christmas .
but those plans have been delayed in parliament because of concern among some state leaders that the new laws threaten civil liberties .
' cause of concern ' australia has not experienced a major terrorist attack on its soil , although australians overseas have been targeted in blasts in indonesia .
mr howard told reporters in canberra the government had received information which gave " cause for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat " .
" we have seen material .
it is a cause of concern , " he said .
but he said the current security alert would not be upgraded .
mr howard said the proposed amendment would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to protect australians .
the change was approved by the house of representatives on wednesday , and the upper house senate would be recalled on thursday to pass it into law , he said .
the amendment will replace the word " the " with " a " in the definition of a terrorism offence , to clarify that it is not necessary to identify a particular terrorist act .
it would mean that people could be charged for considering a terrorist attack , even if they had not yet decided on its timing and location .
mr howard 's announcement came a day after the nation 's domestic intelligence service warned in its annual general report to parliament of a threat of home-grown terrorists .
reforms row the amendment comes as the federal and state governments negotiate a larger package of anti-terror measures .
the measures include tightened security at airports the government needs the support of the states - all run by the opposition labor party - to enforce the measures .
state leaders , who backed the bill last month but have yet to agree a detailed draft , fear it could threaten civil liberties and breach the constitution .
the law would allow terror suspects to be held without charge for 14 days .
the most controversial element is a shoot-to-kill provision , giving police officers the right to use lethal force in the pursuit of suspected terrorists .

sergeant ray holmes , who died earlier this year at 90 in wirral , rammed his plane into the bomber when he found he had run out of ammunition .
his former squadron will be presented with a model of the hurricane made from its melted-down engine on wednesday .
sgt holmes 's widow anne will attend the ceremony at the 504 squadron base at raf cottesmore in rutland .
the airman managed to survive by parachuting out of his plane after crashing into the tail of the german dornier aircraft in september 1940 , during the battle of britain .
the german plane spiralled into the forecourt of victoria station .
air vice-marshal barry newton , honorary inspector-general of the royal auxiliary air force , said : " sgt holmes deserves the highest praise for his courage and determination .
" he was one of our heroes , in the finest traditions of the auxiliary air force .
sgt holmes ' heroic ramming of a german bomber has become one of the most celebrated events of the battle of britain air chief marshal sir jock stirrup , chief of the air staff " it is fitting that the date of 15 september , when he slammed his hurricane into that dornier , has come to be known as battle of britain day and has been commemorated every year since . "
last year , archaeologists unearthed parts of sgt holmes 's fighter plane for a tv documentary about his exploits .
sgt holmes , whose nickname was arty , continued to fly throughout the war , becoming an instructor teaching russians how to fly hurricanes .
he later moved into photo-reconnaissance , taking pictures from 30,000ft over germany of locations such as berlin and hitler 's hideout at berchtesgaden .
he ended the war flying as the king 's messenger , delivering mail for prime minister sir winston churchill .
air chief marshal sir jock stirrup , chief of the air staff , said : " sgt holmes ' heroic ramming of a german bomber has become one of the most celebrated events of the battle of britain .

amanda d 'argue , 39 , of bolton , greater manchester , believes the drug could help her prevent the disease returning .
but her primary care trust said it was not licensed for use on sufferers in the early stages of cancer .
ms d 'argue , who has two children aged six and seven , said she believed the real issue was cost .
she said : " it is an nhs lottery and it always will be and however they dress it up the bottom line is it 's about money .
' does n't come back ' " my children jessica and thomas have been absolutely fantastic .
they 're six and seven and they 're taking mummy being poorly in their stride .
" i have to have everything that i possibly can to make sure that this does n't come back again . "
ms d 'argue was diagnosed with breast cancer in july and has since had a mastectomy , undergone chemotherapy and faces 15 radiotherapy sessions .
bolton primary care trust said it would not approve the drug until it was certain it was safe .
herceptin is already used on people in the advanced stages of breast cancer and can cost £ 30,000 a year .
trials are being carried out to assess its benefits and possible side effects when used on women in the earlier stages of the disease .
meanwhile , ms d 'argue 's friends and family are trying to raise enough money to buy the drug privately .
