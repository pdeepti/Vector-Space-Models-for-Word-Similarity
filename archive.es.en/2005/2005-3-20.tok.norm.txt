" country of origin " principle angers unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during politicians , non-governmental groups and trade unionists from across europe protested against a planned deregulation of the eu 's services sector saying it will erode europe 's cherished social welfare benefits .
a main target for the unions was the " country of origin principle " contained in the directive , which would allow a business to operate in another country under the laws of its own .
the unions say this will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . the president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso , has infuriated the unions by saying there was no question of abandoning the country of origin principle . " in italy , we are already at war with the liberal policies of -lrb- prime minister silvio -rrb- berlusconi , " said an italian union demonstrator , sergio sinchetto in an interview with afp .
" we do not want to see a directive that extends this policy on the european scale . " constitution may face protest-related " no " votes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discontent over the directive appeared to spill over and threaten approval of the proposed european constitution , which is subject to popular referendum in several countries including france , where for the first time this week a majority of voters indicated they would reject it . the country of origin principle has been rejected not only by unions and left wing parties but has been criticized by governments in several member states with highly developed social welfare structures , including france , germany , belgium and sweden .
in france , unions went out on strike earlier this month against threats to public services . free marketeers are challenged by those who argue that services of general interest to the public should be protected from commercial pressure .
" the european union is not only about capitalism , but about workers and the 19 million without jobs , " said a banner carried by a group of marchers from slovenia . " in a market where everything is liberalized , we are an anomaly , we the public service workers , " said french demonstrator bernard soula . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .
a rejection by the french could kill the treaty .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.03.2005 " new europe " giving us the cold shoulder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is among those states pulling troops and support out of iraq after committing troops to the us-led invasion and occupation of iraq , the so-called " new european " states are gradually turning their backs on the united states as rewards fail to materialize . us president george w. bush 's previously faithful and proud new european allies are gradually withdrawing their support for his cause in iraq .
in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .
socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany -lrb- photo -rrb- could not secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority to extend the mandate .
the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .
for his part bush has done little or nothing to compensate the governments who took a risk in going against public opinion , although he did travel to the slovak capital bratislava last month to publicly thank slovaks . but the lucrative contracts for reconstructing iraq were late in coming , just like the financial aid promised by washington .
poland was awarded just one sizeable contract , worth 241 million euros -lrb- $ 320 million -rrb- for supplying armies in iraq . and while dozens of " new europe 's " soldiers have already been killed in iraq , the region 's inhabitants consider they are still treated as second class citizens by washington . despite their governments ' strong lobbying to bush , they are still subject to visa requirements for visiting the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .
socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany -lrb- photo -rrb- could not secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority to extend the mandate .
the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

" the name refers to dutch former eu commissioner frits bolkestein , who first introduced the measure .
it is considered a key plank in the eu strategy to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , adopted in 2000 with the aim of making europe the world 's most competitive society by 2010 . the directive aims to revitalize the economy by enabling service providers to compete anywhere in the 25-member eu and take full advantage of its market of 456 million people . " country of origin " principle angers unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during politicians , non-governmental groups and trade unionists from across europe protested against a planned deregulation of the eu 's services sector saying it will erode europe 's cherished social welfare benefits .
a main target for the unions was the " country of origin principle " contained in the directive , which would allow a business to operate in another country under the laws of its own .
the unions say this will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . the president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso , has infuriated the unions by saying there was no question of abandoning the country of origin principle . " in italy , we are already at war with the liberal policies of -lrb- prime minister silvio -rrb- berlusconi , " said an italian union demonstrator , sergio sinchetto in an interview with afp .
" we do not want to see a directive that extends this policy on the european scale . " constitution may face protest-related " no " votes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discontent over the directive appeared to spill over and threaten approval of the proposed european constitution , which is subject to popular referendum in several countries including france , where for the first time this week a majority of voters indicated they would reject it . the country of origin principle has been rejected not only by unions and left wing parties but has been criticized by governments in several member states with highly developed social welfare structures , including france , germany , belgium and sweden .
in france , unions went out on strike earlier this month against threats to public services . free marketeers are challenged by those who argue that services of general interest to the public should be protected from commercial pressure .
" the european union is not only about capitalism , but about workers and the 19 million without jobs , " said a banner carried by a group of marchers from slovenia . " in a market where everything is liberalized , we are an anomaly , we the public service workers , " said french demonstrator bernard soula . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

to his supporters , a much-maligned intellectual .
as paul wolfowitz edges closer to being installed as the new head of the world bank , the jury is still out . paul wolfowitz says he will be his own man as president of the world bank , committed to the lofty goals of an organisation that is on the frontlines of the war against poverty . but the us deputy defence secretary has earned notoriety for his more divisive actions in another war , in iraq . for critics his role in that , coupled with his championing of the " neoconservative " world view , makes him the worst possible choice for one of the most important jobs in the multinational system . emi woods , an analyst at washington 's institute for political studies , told afp that putting wolfowitz in charge of the world bank was akin to giving herod the keys to the nursery .
" someone who has totally mishandled the reconstruction process in iraq , making sure that corporations benefit while a lot of iraqis do n't have electricity or running water , this is not the right person for a position where he will be responsible for the entire world , " she said . following his surprise nomination on wednesday by president george w. bush to take a job that is traditionally in washington 's gift , wolfowitz has sought to appease his critics by pledging that he will be nobody 's stooge . " if i am chosen to be the president then i would view my job as trying to pull together the strongest possible consensus to get the thing done , " he said in an interview with friday 's financial times newspaper . an advocate of transparency ? wolfowitz described the world bank 's mission to reduce global poverty as " one of the greatest moral challenges of our time " , while also stressing the importance of fighting corruption and promoting transparency . one criticism levelled against the world bank has been that it is too wedded to high-profile infrastructure projects favoured by governments in the developing world , and not enough to the needs of ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out-going world bank president james d. wolfensohn .
during his decade-long stint , outgoing president james wolfensohn has done much to address that criticism by reorienting the bank 's focus into backing education and health policies in impoverished nations .
with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- imf , world bank warn of imbalances although the economy as a whole is in its best shape in three decades , improved growth is threatened by disparities between wealthy nations and the developing world as well as rising oil prices .

at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .

to his supporters , a much-maligned intellectual .
as paul wolfowitz edges closer to being installed as the new head of the world bank , the jury is still out . paul wolfowitz says he will be his own man as president of the world bank , committed to the lofty goals of an organisation that is on the frontlines of the war against poverty . but the us deputy defence secretary has earned notoriety for his more divisive actions in another war , in iraq . for critics his role in that , coupled with his championing of the " neoconservative " world view , makes him the worst possible choice for one of the most important jobs in the multinational system . emi woods , an analyst at washington 's institute for political studies , told afp that putting wolfowitz in charge of the world bank was akin to giving herod the keys to the nursery .
" someone who has totally mishandled the reconstruction process in iraq , making sure that corporations benefit while a lot of iraqis do n't have electricity or running water , this is not the right person for a position where he will be responsible for the entire world , " she said . following his surprise nomination on wednesday by president george w. bush to take a job that is traditionally in washington 's gift , wolfowitz has sought to appease his critics by pledging that he will be nobody 's stooge . " if i am chosen to be the president then i would view my job as trying to pull together the strongest possible consensus to get the thing done , " he said in an interview with friday 's financial times newspaper . an advocate of transparency ? wolfowitz described the world bank 's mission to reduce global poverty as " one of the greatest moral challenges of our time " , while also stressing the importance of fighting corruption and promoting transparency . one criticism levelled against the world bank has been that it is too wedded to high-profile infrastructure projects favoured by governments in the developing world , and not enough to the needs of ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out-going world bank president james d. wolfensohn .
during his decade-long stint , outgoing president james wolfensohn has done much to address that criticism by reorienting the bank 's focus into backing education and health policies in impoverished nations .
with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- imf , world bank warn of imbalances although the economy as a whole is in its best shape in three decades , improved growth is threatened by disparities between wealthy nations and the developing world as well as rising oil prices .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .

in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .

bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .

the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .

poland was awarded just one sizeable contract , worth 241 million euros -lrb- $ 320 million -rrb- for supplying armies in iraq . and while dozens of " new europe 's " soldiers have already been killed in iraq , the region 's inhabitants consider they are still treated as second class citizens by washington . despite their governments ' strong lobbying to bush , they are still subject to visa requirements for visiting the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.03.2005 " new europe " giving us the cold shoulder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is among those states pulling troops and support out of iraq after committing troops to the us-led invasion and occupation of iraq , the so-called " new european " states are gradually turning their backs on the united states as rewards fail to materialize . us president george w. bush 's previously faithful and proud new european allies are gradually withdrawing their support for his cause in iraq .
in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .

at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .

in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .
socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany -lrb- photo -rrb- could not secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority to extend the mandate .
the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .
for his part bush has done little or nothing to compensate the governments who took a risk in going against public opinion , although he did travel to the slovak capital bratislava last month to publicly thank slovaks . but the lucrative contracts for reconstructing iraq were late in coming , just like the financial aid promised by washington .
poland was awarded just one sizeable contract , worth 241 million euros -lrb- $ 320 million -rrb- for supplying armies in iraq . and while dozens of " new europe 's " soldiers have already been killed in iraq , the region 's inhabitants consider they are still treated as second class citizens by washington . despite their governments ' strong lobbying to bush , they are still subject to visa requirements for visiting the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.
-lrb- march 16 , 2004 -rrb- poland to reduce force in iraq poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.03.2005 " new europe " giving us the cold shoulder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is among those states pulling troops and support out of iraq after committing troops to the us-led invasion and occupation of iraq , the so-called " new european " states are gradually turning their backs on the united states as rewards fail to materialize . us president george w. bush 's previously faithful and proud new european allies are gradually withdrawing their support for his cause in iraq .
in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .
socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany -lrb- photo -rrb- could not secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority to extend the mandate .
the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .
for his part bush has done little or nothing to compensate the governments who took a risk in going against public opinion , although he did travel to the slovak capital bratislava last month to publicly thank slovaks . but the lucrative contracts for reconstructing iraq were late in coming , just like the financial aid promised by washington .
poland was awarded just one sizeable contract , worth 241 million euros -lrb- $ 320 million -rrb- for supplying armies in iraq . and while dozens of " new europe 's " soldiers have already been killed in iraq , the region 's inhabitants consider they are still treated as second class citizens by washington . despite their governments ' strong lobbying to bush , they are still subject to visa requirements for visiting the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.

to his supporters , a much-maligned intellectual .
as paul wolfowitz edges closer to being installed as the new head of the world bank , the jury is still out . paul wolfowitz says he will be his own man as president of the world bank , committed to the lofty goals of an organisation that is on the frontlines of the war against poverty . but the us deputy defence secretary has earned notoriety for his more divisive actions in another war , in iraq . for critics his role in that , coupled with his championing of the " neoconservative " world view , makes him the worst possible choice for one of the most important jobs in the multinational system . emi woods , an analyst at washington 's institute for political studies , told afp that putting wolfowitz in charge of the world bank was akin to giving herod the keys to the nursery .
" someone who has totally mishandled the reconstruction process in iraq , making sure that corporations benefit while a lot of iraqis do n't have electricity or running water , this is not the right person for a position where he will be responsible for the entire world , " she said . following his surprise nomination on wednesday by president george w. bush to take a job that is traditionally in washington 's gift , wolfowitz has sought to appease his critics by pledging that he will be nobody 's stooge . " if i am chosen to be the president then i would view my job as trying to pull together the strongest possible consensus to get the thing done , " he said in an interview with friday 's financial times newspaper . an advocate of transparency ? wolfowitz described the world bank 's mission to reduce global poverty as " one of the greatest moral challenges of our time " , while also stressing the importance of fighting corruption and promoting transparency . one criticism levelled against the world bank has been that it is too wedded to high-profile infrastructure projects favoured by governments in the developing world , and not enough to the needs of ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out-going world bank president james d. wolfensohn .
during his decade-long stint , outgoing president james wolfensohn has done much to address that criticism by reorienting the bank 's focus into backing education and health policies in impoverished nations .
with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .

the unions say this will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . the president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso , has infuriated the unions by saying there was no question of abandoning the country of origin principle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.03.2005 a wolf in development 's clothing ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one truly knows what wolfowitz will bring to the world bank to his critics , he is the most heinous of ideologues .
to his supporters , a much-maligned intellectual .
as paul wolfowitz edges closer to being installed as the new head of the world bank , the jury is still out . paul wolfowitz says he will be his own man as president of the world bank , committed to the lofty goals of an organisation that is on the frontlines of the war against poverty . but the us deputy defence secretary has earned notoriety for his more divisive actions in another war , in iraq . for critics his role in that , coupled with his championing of the " neoconservative " world view , makes him the worst possible choice for one of the most important jobs in the multinational system . emi woods , an analyst at washington 's institute for political studies , told afp that putting wolfowitz in charge of the world bank was akin to giving herod the keys to the nursery .
" someone who has totally mishandled the reconstruction process in iraq , making sure that corporations benefit while a lot of iraqis do n't have electricity or running water , this is not the right person for a position where he will be responsible for the entire world , " she said . following his surprise nomination on wednesday by president george w. bush to take a job that is traditionally in washington 's gift , wolfowitz has sought to appease his critics by pledging that he will be nobody 's stooge . " if i am chosen to be the president then i would view my job as trying to pull together the strongest possible consensus to get the thing done , " he said in an interview with friday 's financial times newspaper . an advocate of transparency ? wolfowitz described the world bank 's mission to reduce global poverty as " one of the greatest moral challenges of our time " , while also stressing the importance of fighting corruption and promoting transparency . one criticism levelled against the world bank has been that it is too wedded to high-profile infrastructure projects favoured by governments in the developing world , and not enough to the needs of ordinary people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out-going world bank president james d. wolfensohn .
during his decade-long stint , outgoing president james wolfensohn has done much to address that criticism by reorienting the bank 's focus into backing education and health policies in impoverished nations .
with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- imf , world bank warn of imbalances although the economy as a whole is in its best shape in three decades , improved growth is threatened by disparities between wealthy nations and the developing world as well as rising oil prices .
-lrb- oct .

in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .

so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .

" the name refers to dutch former eu commissioner frits bolkestein , who first introduced the measure .
it is considered a key plank in the eu strategy to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , adopted in 2000 with the aim of making europe the world 's most competitive society by 2010 . the directive aims to revitalize the economy by enabling service providers to compete anywhere in the 25-member eu and take full advantage of its market of 456 million people . " country of origin " principle angers unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during politicians , non-governmental groups and trade unionists from across europe protested against a planned deregulation of the eu 's services sector saying it will erode europe 's cherished social welfare benefits .
a main target for the unions was the " country of origin principle " contained in the directive , which would allow a business to operate in another country under the laws of its own .
the unions say this will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . the president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso , has infuriated the unions by saying there was no question of abandoning the country of origin principle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.03.2005 " new europe " giving us the cold shoulder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is among those states pulling troops and support out of iraq after committing troops to the us-led invasion and occupation of iraq , the so-called " new european " states are gradually turning their backs on the united states as rewards fail to materialize . us president george w. bush 's previously faithful and proud new european allies are gradually withdrawing their support for his cause in iraq .
in the space of just a few months , bush 's more faithful allies in central and eastern europe have one by one begun a complete or partial withdrawal of their troops from iraq . yet , only two years ago , the heads of former communist bloc countries were prepared to brave the irritation of france and germany , standing firmly at the united states ' side .
recognizing the role played by washington in helping fall of communism , they were sympathetic to the bush crusade for freedom . but the bush regime has remained largely ungrateful for their efforts . strong supporter bulgaria calls it a day bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgarian president georgi parvanov will discuss further troop withdrawals in the summer .
so now even bulgaria , which orchestrated eastern europe 's support for the campaign against saddam hussein , announced on thursday that it would reduce its presence in iraq by 100 soldiers at the end of june .
bulgarian defense minister nicolas svinarov said his government would examine the question of the withdrawal before the end of march . the baltic former soviet republic of latvia already reduced its small contingent in november , hungary has withdrawn all its 300 troops and poland cut its troops at the time of the iraqi parliamentary elections on january 30 , from 2,400 soldiers to 1,700 .
poland , which controls a zone to the south of baghdad , predicts that it will recall several hundred more troops from july . east european governments have played down their decisions .
" this is not a political decision , the contingent 's reduction was dictated by practical reasons , " latvia 's defense minister atis slakteris said .
and polish president aleksander kwasniewski used the iraqi elections to claim that a new era had begun for the country . anxious to hold on to one of its better allies in europe , us secretary of state condoleezza rice quietly accepted poland 's arguments .
less diplomatic was her danish counterpart per stig möller , who harshly criticized poland .
" i think it 's simply absurd to say that now that democracy is in place we can leave , " said möller . internal pressure sways decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in hungary the reasons for withdrawal are clear .
socialist prime minister ferenc gyurcsany -lrb- photo -rrb- could not secure a two-thirds parliamentary majority to extend the mandate .
the conservative opposition refused to give its support , arguing that the large majority of hungarians opposed the country 's presence in iraq . and across most of the region opinions have only slightly changed over the past two years in their opposition to a military presence in iraq . in hungary , before the parliamentary vote , 54 percent of people asked supported withdrawing troops compared to just 19 percent who wanted to maintain the troops . in poland more than two-thirds of citizens oppose deployment of their soldiers in iraq against less than 30 percent who are in favor . small reward for great sacrifice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , thanked slovak president ivan gasparovic in bratislava but tangible rewards have been few and far between .
for his part bush has done little or nothing to compensate the governments who took a risk in going against public opinion , although he did travel to the slovak capital bratislava last month to publicly thank slovaks . but the lucrative contracts for reconstructing iraq were late in coming , just like the financial aid promised by washington .
poland was awarded just one sizeable contract , worth 241 million euros -lrb- $ 320 million -rrb- for supplying armies in iraq . and while dozens of " new europe 's " soldiers have already been killed in iraq , the region 's inhabitants consider they are still treated as second class citizens by washington . despite their governments ' strong lobbying to bush , they are still subject to visa requirements for visiting the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. hopes u.n. resolution will keep spain in iraq with the new spanish government threatening to withdraw its troops from iraq , a bush administration spokesman has said washington may draft a new resolution that would cede more power to the u.n.
-lrb- march 16 , 2004 -rrb- poland to reduce force in iraq poland will significantly reduce its number of troops in iraq by the end of 2005 , the country 's defense minister said on monday .
the move could reflect some poles ' increasing dissatisfaction with american policies .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

renault 's fernando alonso took the flag and the top points in sepang on sunday . german world champion michael schumacher scored his first points of the season at the malaysian grand prix on sunday but finished a disappointing seventh as the checkered flag went to the spaniard fernando alonso who claimed his second career win and moved to the top of the world championship table when he eased to victory . schumacher was n't even the highest placed german at the end of the race with williams driver nick heidfeld taking third and a podium place while the world title holder 's younger brother ralf finished two places above him in fifth . alonso led from pole position and overcame minor handling troubles in the closing stages to stay ahead of italian jarno trulli , who took a satisfying second place to give toyota their first ever formula one podium finish . sapped of strength , alonso celebrates win alonso had to crouch on the podium after an energy-sapping race spent without the use of a drinks bottle and he admitted : " it was very tough conditions and i finished on the limit today .
we knew before the start of the race that it would be tough , but my drinks bottle did n't work and i had problems .
but i was not pushing very hard during the race and the car was easy to drive . " " the last 15 of 20 laps were very long and the same for everyone here in sepang , but maybe more when you are in position one .
you are very close to winning the race but everything was fine and we showed we are the team to beat . " trulli was delighted with his podium finish and said : " i had an extremely good start but the renault seems to get away well .
i drove my race , i was competitive and i started managing the race , taking care of the tyres .
it is fantastic to bring the first podium finish to toyota .
we were quite comfortable on reliability even though the conditions are difficult here and the team has done a good job over the winter . " heidfeld battles to third bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick heidfeld but the battle was waged behind for third place as australian grand prix winner giancarlo fisichella fought with williams pair mark webber and heidfeld and toyota 's ralf schumacher for the final place on the podium . the position eventually went to german heidfeld , who secured his first podium for williams , after italian fisichella and australian webber crashed into retirement and german schumacher faded away in the closing stages . heidfeld said : " it was very hot .
my drink bottle failed - it always happens where you do n't want it to .
i had to push quite hard because i was only 10th in qualifying .
i had a good start and some good overtaking moves .

world champion schumacher hung onto seventh as he stayed ahead of eighth-placed austrian christian klien , who ensured red bull racing secured a second consecutive double points finish . schumacher admitted that his chances of retaining his crown for a sixth consecutive year are already not looking good after just two races of the season . ferrari were way ahead of the competition last year as they dominated the championship and won 16 of the 18 races on their way to their sixth consecutive constructors ' title .

we have to improve in all those different areas .
we can see that in comparison with the other teams our -lrb- current -rrb- car is not the best . " when i came here i did n't expect a very strong race but friday and saturday morning it did n't look too bad .

we have won together and we lose together . " the full picture of the season , which at 19 races is the longest ever in the history of the sport , is yet to be revealed , however , and schumacher believes ferrari are not as far behind as results suggest .

" the name refers to dutch former eu commissioner frits bolkestein , who first introduced the measure .
it is considered a key plank in the eu strategy to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , adopted in 2000 with the aim of making europe the world 's most competitive society by 2010 . the directive aims to revitalize the economy by enabling service providers to compete anywhere in the 25-member eu and take full advantage of its market of 456 million people . " country of origin " principle angers unions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during politicians , non-governmental groups and trade unionists from across europe protested against a planned deregulation of the eu 's services sector saying it will erode europe 's cherished social welfare benefits .
a main target for the unions was the " country of origin principle " contained in the directive , which would allow a business to operate in another country under the laws of its own .
the unions say this will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . the president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso , has infuriated the unions by saying there was no question of abandoning the country of origin principle . " in italy , we are already at war with the liberal policies of -lrb- prime minister silvio -rrb- berlusconi , " said an italian union demonstrator , sergio sinchetto in an interview with afp .
" we do not want to see a directive that extends this policy on the european scale . " constitution may face protest-related " no " votes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discontent over the directive appeared to spill over and threaten approval of the proposed european constitution , which is subject to popular referendum in several countries including france , where for the first time this week a majority of voters indicated they would reject it . the country of origin principle has been rejected not only by unions and left wing parties but has been criticized by governments in several member states with highly developed social welfare structures , including france , germany , belgium and sweden .
in france , unions went out on strike earlier this month against threats to public services . free marketeers are challenged by those who argue that services of general interest to the public should be protected from commercial pressure .
" the european union is not only about capitalism , but about workers and the 19 million without jobs , " said a banner carried by a group of marchers from slovenia . " in a market where everything is liberalized , we are an anomaly , we the public service workers , " said french demonstrator bernard soula . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .
a rejection by the french could kill the treaty .

with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .
-lrb- march 18 , 2005 -rrb- imf , world bank warn of imbalances although the economy as a whole is in its best shape in three decades , improved growth is threatened by disparities between wealthy nations and the developing world as well as rising oil prices .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .

at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .

" since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .

the intention is to smooth the way before a full summit on tuesday but few are hopeful of success . the eu is bracing for crunch talks on reforming the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules on sunday , hoping to resolve stubborn rifts ahead of a summit next week already clouded by questions of wider economic strategy . the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- 's luxembourg presidency has taken the unusual step of convening a meeting of finance ministers on a weekend , to try to strike a compromise before the bloc 's traditional spring economic summit next tuesday . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker has sought to downplay the sense of crisis over reforms to the stability and growth pact , the rule book underpinning europe 's single currency .
" if we do n't reach an agreement on sunday it will not be a catastrophe .
it will not prevent us finding an accord at the summit , " he said earlier in the week . but few are under any illusion that juncker - who is also his country 's finance minister - would like to reach agreement on the pact on sunday 's meeting , which diplomats warn could extend into a traditional eu marathon . a history of calamities the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were left off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had submitted wrong data for years . now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines . germany calls for delays in action eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . sunday 's extraordinary pre-summit finance ministers ' meeting was called after regular talks earlier this month failed to find a breakthrough .
at that meeting the eu presidency notably proposed a list of special circumstances , under which countries would be allowed to breach the three percent of gdp ceiling . but that was rejected notably by new eu member states , which have pushed through painful reforms to meet the budget rules only to see the old eu heavyweights flout them repeatedly . juncker to present new plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker .
ahead of this weekend 's talks juncker is expected to present another compromise proposal .
eu sources say that , instead of a list of specific circumstances , the new plan will set out in broader terms situations when more flexibility would be allowed . " since we ca n't agree on the definition of this list we are thinking of doing away with it , " he told the french daily le figaro this week .
" we are talking about replacing the list with more general terms , " he said . it remains unclear whether a deal can be struck sunday , or whether the thorny issue will have to be handed over to eu leaders next week .
their menu is already packed , including notably how to re-launch the eu 's so-called lisbon agenda drive for growth , hammer out an accord to free up europe 's vast services sector , not to mention a looming row over long-term budget plans . juncker will be happy if he can strike a fiscal pact deal by the end of the weekend . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

with an annual budget of $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- and 10,000 staff around the world , the international monetary fund 's sister institution is in the vanguard of promoting sustainable development . a chance to further the new american century ? but for his opponents , wolfowitz has shown little interest in development and every interest in furthering a neoconservative cause that sees us-style liberal democracy and free markets as the acme of human achievement . the new york times highlighted his mistaken premises that led to the iraq war and said his nomination , like that of the hardline deputy secretary of state john bolton as un ambassador earlier this month , was " a slap at the international community " . recalling his hands-on stint as ambassador to indonesia and assistant secretary of state for east asia in the 1980s , the times said : " we can only hope that mr. wolfowitz reverts to his earlier incarnation in his new job . " a man to wield the axe and sweep the broom ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world bank in washington .
for his supporters , wolfowitz will bring some overdue scrutiny to the bank .
the wall street journal echoed the view of many republicans in congress that the bank has a " dysfunctional bureaucracy that requires deep reform " . the european union 's development commissioner , louis michel , has invited wolfowitz to present his future plans if confirmed to succeed wolfensohn in june . analysts say that european nations will begrudgingly accede to bush 's wish to install his man at the world bank and continue a tradition that sees europe , in turn , get to choose the boss of the imf .
but german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said " the enthusiasm in old europe is not exactly overwhelming " . power for good as well as evil ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at any rate , some see a silver lining in having an arch-hawk with bush 's ear put into such an influential role .
" if wolfowitz is sincere then it would be an advantage , he would have the support of the administration and that could be a very good thing , " said carol graham at the brookings institution . but if he sticks to his neocon instincts and listens to the white house rather than global opinion , " it could be a very damaging thing for the bank " , she added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe ponders wolfowitz nomination most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday .

rowan williams said scientific progress and the " rising number " of abortions made a debate on the issue essential .
last week , the roman catholic archbishop of westminster , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor , called for abortion to become an election issue .
dr williams , writing in the sunday times , said he hoped the questioning of candidates could prompt a wider debate .
tory leader michael howard supports a reduction in the legal limit when abortions are allowed from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are " tantamount to abortion on demand " .
but prime minister tony blair has made it clear he has no plans to change the law .
he says abortion should not be an election issue , arguing it is a matter for individual conscience .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean " i do n't know what i would do now " .
' deliberate termination ' dr williams said the large majority of christians considered abortion " the deliberate termination of a human life " .
the current law had created a " groundswell of distaste " in the country at large , he said .
dr williams said technological advances had provided a clearer picture of foetuses ' consciousness and sensitivity to pain , and helped to keep prematurely-born babies alive .
that had prompted " a sharper recognition of the foetus as a natural candidate for ' rights ' of some kind " , he said .
it would be a real failure if agreeing that it was not an electoral issue provided an alibi for taking it seriously as a public issue rowan williams dr williams said raising the issue with parliamentary candidates - though unlikely to lead to any electoral pledges - could help to open up a necessary public debate .
" it would be a real failure if agreeing that it was not an electoral issue provided an alibi for taking it seriously as a public issue , " he wrote .
dr williams insisted that christians must be allowed to take part in that debate .
he said the idea that it entailed capitulating to what he called " a neanderthal christian right that was plotting a takeover " was alarmist nonsense .
meanwhile , a poll of 800 adults commissioned by the sunday express found that 60 % of respondents said the time limit for abortions should be cut .
some 24 % backed the present limit and 76 % of those interviewed by nop world said the limit should not be any different for under 16s .

rowan williams said scientific progress and the " rising number " of abortions made a debate on the issue essential .
last week , the roman catholic archbishop of westminster , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor , called for abortion to become an election issue .
dr williams , writing in the sunday times , said he hoped the questioning of candidates could prompt a wider debate .
tory leader michael howard supports a reduction in the legal limit when abortions are allowed from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are " tantamount to abortion on demand " .
but prime minister tony blair has made it clear he has no plans to change the law .
he says abortion should not be an election issue , arguing it is a matter for individual conscience .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean " i do n't know what i would do now " .
' deliberate termination ' dr williams said the large majority of christians considered abortion " the deliberate termination of a human life " .
the current law had created a " groundswell of distaste " in the country at large , he said .
dr williams said technological advances had provided a clearer picture of foetuses ' consciousness and sensitivity to pain , and helped to keep prematurely-born babies alive .
that had prompted " a sharper recognition of the foetus as a natural candidate for ' rights ' of some kind " , he said .
it would be a real failure if agreeing that it was not an electoral issue provided an alibi for taking it seriously as a public issue rowan williams dr williams said raising the issue with parliamentary candidates - though unlikely to lead to any electoral pledges - could help to open up a necessary public debate .
" it would be a real failure if agreeing that it was not an electoral issue provided an alibi for taking it seriously as a public issue , " he wrote .
dr williams insisted that christians must be allowed to take part in that debate .
he said the idea that it entailed capitulating to what he called " a neanderthal christian right that was plotting a takeover " was alarmist nonsense .

bbc three 's raphael rowe meets criminals with electronic tags , and investigates the companies that are supposed to be keeping a close eye on them .
electronic tags are designed to keep criminals in their homes under curfew and to stop them going out to commit crimes .
there are currently 10,000 criminals on a tag .
most of them are on the home detention curfew scheme , which allows prisoners to leave jail early .
the private companies that monitor these offenders make millions of pounds through government contracts .
the british government says it wants to double the number of offenders on electronic tags by 2008 .
seen as a tool to tackle prison population numbers , juveniles , terror suspects and custodial battles , labour wants this virtual prison to be the new solve-all sentence .
so does the tag work ?
i embarked on a four month journey to find out more from the criminals , the victims , and the employees of the companies .
i uncovered confidential documents that revealed the tragic consequences of a tagging company 's failure to act on a repeat offender .
i began my journey by meeting several tagged offenders , all of whom have their own story to tell about how their tags are really working .
in at seven o 'clock , what 's that ?
how is that going to stop your crime young offender some admitted repeatedly committing crimes while wearing the tag and others claimed to have beaten the system .
one young man i met told me that he took his tag off .
although he was supposed to be at home under curfew , he was in fact " robbing cars , going to parties , drinking " .
the tagging company took no action and he was free to do what he liked for a month .
another young criminal told me that he could n't see how a tag would stop him committing crime .
" in at seven o 'clock , what 's that ?
how is that going to stop your crime ? " he said .
their weary parents were not confident that tags were a sufficient punishment for their children .
many of the parents i spoke to would rather see their child locked up in prison .
" matthew should be in prison , he is my son and i think a proper sentence in prison would do matthew the world of good , more than the tag , " one told me .
tagging companies i spoke to current and ex-employees of the tagging companies .
talking to these people made me aware of the widespread technical problems with the equipment .
i uncovered a catalogue of technical failures and control centre mismanagement that lead to criminals being left unmonitored and free to breach their curfews .
one former employee said the system was so mismanaged that recently released offenders would phone up asking why they had not been tagged yet .
" they 've said , ' when 're you gonna come round and put the tag on ?
i 've just come out of prison yesterday : i 'm meant to be tagged . " '
i spoke to experts to ask them what research says about tagging .
" it says what you would expect it to say , which is that it has no basic impact on crime , on re-offending . "
when we challenged the home office it admitted that there was no research to show that tagging criminals stops re-offending .

bbc three 's raphael rowe meets criminals with electronic tags , and investigates the companies that are supposed to be keeping a close eye on them .
electronic tags are designed to keep criminals in their homes under curfew and to stop them going out to commit crimes .
there are currently 10,000 criminals on a tag .
most of them are on the home detention curfew scheme , which allows prisoners to leave jail early .
the private companies that monitor these offenders make millions of pounds through government contracts .
the british government says it wants to double the number of offenders on electronic tags by 2008 .
seen as a tool to tackle prison population numbers , juveniles , terror suspects and custodial battles , labour wants this virtual prison to be the new solve-all sentence .
so does the tag work ?
i embarked on a four month journey to find out more from the criminals , the victims , and the employees of the companies .
i uncovered confidential documents that revealed the tragic consequences of a tagging company 's failure to act on a repeat offender .
i began my journey by meeting several tagged offenders , all of whom have their own story to tell about how their tags are really working .
in at seven o 'clock , what 's that ?
how is that going to stop your crime young offender some admitted repeatedly committing crimes while wearing the tag and others claimed to have beaten the system .
one young man i met told me that he took his tag off .
although he was supposed to be at home under curfew , he was in fact " robbing cars , going to parties , drinking " .
the tagging company took no action and he was free to do what he liked for a month .
another young criminal told me that he could n't see how a tag would stop him committing crime .
" in at seven o 'clock , what 's that ?
how is that going to stop your crime ? " he said .
their weary parents were not confident that tags were a sufficient punishment for their children .
many of the parents i spoke to would rather see their child locked up in prison .
" matthew should be in prison , he is my son and i think a proper sentence in prison would do matthew the world of good , more than the tag , " one told me .
tagging companies i spoke to current and ex-employees of the tagging companies .
talking to these people made me aware of the widespread technical problems with the equipment .
i uncovered a catalogue of technical failures and control centre mismanagement that lead to criminals being left unmonitored and free to breach their curfews .
one former employee said the system was so mismanaged that recently released offenders would phone up asking why they had not been tagged yet .
" they 've said , ' when 're you gonna come round and put the tag on ?
i 've just come out of prison yesterday : i 'm meant to be tagged . " '
i spoke to experts to ask them what research says about tagging .

they are calling on the government to help them by reducing tax on fuel .
mark mcallister , general manager of the recovery service mcallisters recovery in aldershot , hampshire , says current diesel costs are higher than ever .
" these increases are crippling businesses and our business is being strangled because the cost of fuel is going up all the time , " he said .
' terrifying ' mr mcallister recalled the fuel protests of just over four years ago , when protests by farmers and hauliers outside oil sites caused pumps to run dry around the country .
" fuel prices now are definitely at their worst since the protests in september 2000 .
" what is really frustrating is that britain 's fuel prices are totally disproportionate to the rest of europe and that does n't seem right to me .
we could be faced with another fuel demonstration if the government does n't take action paul newton east anglian hauliers group " it would be nice if the government could help by reducing tax on fuel or by giving transport businesses some kind of rebate , " he said .
michael sidley , contracts manager for the weaver group milk hauliers in stoke-on-trent , believes the rises will hit businesses hard .
he said : " we are always disappointed when diesel prices go up because it influences and has a major impact on business .
" the implications of these rises to any business is always quite severe because a percentage of our vehicle costs goes on fuel , and if the price goes up this makes it harder for us .
" it also puts pressure on our relationship with the customer because we have to raise our prices as a result . "
ben mundell , who has been running his own whisky haulage company in argyll for the last 18 years , believes some small transport companies could go out of business .
he said : " the rising costs of fuel prices is terrifying .
they are going up all the time and we never know what to do .
' promises not materialised ' " i would say some small businesses definitely wo n't survive following the latest increases because the prices are going up all the time and this is making it more and more difficult .
" customers do n't realise the effect these rises have on our business too .
the government needs to reduce tax on fuel duty . "
paul newton , chairman of the east anglian hauliers group , believes that continuing rise in fuel prices could lead to protests .
" i am very disappointed by the rises .
we have been objecting to these increases since 1999 and the promises that were made by the government then have failed to materialise .
" the hauliers are very concerned about this because their raw materials are being threatened and we ca n't go forward with these prices going up all the time .
" i think we could be faced with another fuel demonstration if the government does n't take action . "
