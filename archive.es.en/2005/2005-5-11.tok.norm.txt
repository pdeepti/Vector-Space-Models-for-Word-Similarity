dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .

carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .
airbus responded on that front with the a350 project . eads also intends to develop its defense activities , which now only represent 20 percent of the group 's business . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus giant soars into history books the airbus a380 , the biggest airliner ever built , completed a momentous maiden flight on wednesday , winning praise across europe as a " magnificent machine " and opening a new era in aviation history .
-lrb- april 27 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us struggle to prevent " sky wars " the eu and the us still have a " window of opportunity " to amicably resolve a row over aid to aircraft makers boeing and airbus , the eu executive said monday but warned talks can not drag on too long .
-lrb- april 11 , 2005 -rrb- less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2005 eads new chiefs leave airbus hanging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is without a boss since france 's forgeard will co-chair eads the european aeronautic defense and space company held an annual meeting wednesday riven with franco-german tensions as noel forgeard was poised to co-pilot eads without a successor to replace him at airbus . noel forgeard , the french current chief executive of subsidiary airbus , and thomas enders , the german head of the defense division at eads , were set to replace co-ceos philippe camus and rainer hertrich at the company 's annual general meeting . " give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .
airbus responded on that front with the a350 project . eads also intends to develop its defense activities , which now only represent 20 percent of the group 's business . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus giant soars into history books the airbus a380 , the biggest airliner ever built , completed a momentous maiden flight on wednesday , winning praise across europe as a " magnificent machine " and opening a new era in aviation history .
-lrb- april 27 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us struggle to prevent " sky wars " the eu and the us still have a " window of opportunity " to amicably resolve a row over aid to aircraft makers boeing and airbus , the eu executive said monday but warned talks can not drag on too long .
-lrb- april 11 , 2005 -rrb- less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2005 eads new chiefs leave airbus hanging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is without a boss since france 's forgeard will co-chair eads the european aeronautic defense and space company held an annual meeting wednesday riven with franco-german tensions as noel forgeard was poised to co-pilot eads without a successor to replace him at airbus . noel forgeard , the french current chief executive of subsidiary airbus , and thomas enders , the german head of the defense division at eads , were set to replace co-ceos philippe camus and rainer hertrich at the company 's annual general meeting . " give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .
two down ...
17 to go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .
baden-württemberg relies on nuclear energy for 55 percent of its electricity .
replacing lost local nuclear power with imported nuclear power from france or restarting idled coal plants does not make sense , especially if germany wants to meet climate protection targets , gönner said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .

" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .

" the commission 's first assessment of the situation is that this circular -lrb- visa regulations -rrb- of 2000 was not really in full compliance with the common consular instruction , " frattini told a european parliament committee in strasbourg .
the german rules had not provided for sufficient checks of a visa applicant 's wealth and his or her intentions to return home , frattini added .
germany subsequently tightened its visa regulations , in 2004 .
the commission was examining them to ensure that they are in line with eu requirements , frattini said .
the scandal over the liberal regulations has caused foreign minister fischer 's popularity to drop and dealt a blow to germany 's governing coalition . dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press were divided on tuesday on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .

in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .

it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .

but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .

the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .

former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .

it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

" the commission 's first assessment of the situation is that this circular -lrb- visa regulations -rrb- of 2000 was not really in full compliance with the common consular instruction , " frattini told a european parliament committee in strasbourg .
the german rules had not provided for sufficient checks of a visa applicant 's wealth and his or her intentions to return home , frattini added .
germany subsequently tightened its visa regulations , in 2004 .
the commission was examining them to ensure that they are in line with eu requirements , frattini said .
the scandal over the liberal regulations has caused foreign minister fischer 's popularity to drop and dealt a blow to germany 's governing coalition . dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?
german politicians and the press were divided on tuesday on whether foreign minister joschka fischer should keep his job despite his admission that he made mistakes in his handling of an immigration scandal .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .

in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .

but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .

deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation .

" the global air traffic industry remains in a difficult situation , " the german flag carrier wrote in its interim report .
" excess capacities are leading to persistent pressure on average yields .
in addition , we now assume that fuel prices still stay at a high level . "
in concrete terms , the german airline 's fuel bill could amount to 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.2 billion -rrb- this year , 300 million euros more than originally budgeted , chief financial officer karl-ludwig kley told a telephone news conference .
higher fuel costs are pushing other airlines around the world into trouble , with us carrier delta air lines warning this week that its cash reserves may not prove enough to stave off collapse in the coming months .
still , lufthansa intended to offset its additional burdens " via targeted capacity management " and continued cost-cutting , it said .
" against this background , we expect to be able to post full-year operating profit on a par with last year 's figure , " the airline said .
in 2004 , lufthansa booked operating profit of 383 million euros . dw-world.de lufthansa flies to 50-year milestone germany 's national carrier has reason to celebrate its 50th anniversary .
last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course .

" the global air traffic industry remains in a difficult situation , " the german flag carrier wrote in its interim report .
" excess capacities are leading to persistent pressure on average yields .

higher fuel costs are pushing other airlines around the world into trouble , with us carrier delta air lines warning this week that its cash reserves may not prove enough to stave off collapse in the coming months .
still , lufthansa intended to offset its additional burdens " via targeted capacity management " and continued cost-cutting , it said .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .

" at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .

we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .

deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .

the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2005 deutsche börse meets " locusts " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back to eat up some more capital ?
some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2005 opinion : bush in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been a big face in europe these past days president bush has wrapped up his whirlwind european trip to mark the passing of the 60th anniversary of the wwii ceasefire .
it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .
in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .
and in moscow , recognizing the need to appease the russian leadership which was silently smouldering at a further dent in its sphere of influence , bush took part in a victory celebration which was not devoid of the pomp , ceremony and glorification of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and russian premier vladimir putin wearing his american light-heartedness on his sleeve , bush sailed through the difficulties , sticking to his pedantically detailed schedule .
he made gestures big and small , embracing a soviet war veteran and accompanying president vladimir putin for a friendly spin in his soviet old-timer .
it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .
and this exchange of interests was the unwritten motto of bush 's trip to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush received an ecstatic welcome from georgians whether the enthusiasm of the new democracies for " freedom man " bush can hold , will depend upon the success of the local reform powers .
under the protective influence of the eu , the economies in the baltic states is growing with ease .
but in georgia and ukraine the reform process will need a good deal of western help in order to bring about any long-term stability .
but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .
president bush 's trip was to a great extent merely symbolic , leaving it up to the former soviet countries to see how they fare in the democratic world . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .
the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .
in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .
and in moscow , recognizing the need to appease the russian leadership which was silently smouldering at a further dent in its sphere of influence , bush took part in a victory celebration which was not devoid of the pomp , ceremony and glorification of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and russian premier vladimir putin wearing his american light-heartedness on his sleeve , bush sailed through the difficulties , sticking to his pedantically detailed schedule .
he made gestures big and small , embracing a soviet war veteran and accompanying president vladimir putin for a friendly spin in his soviet old-timer .
it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .
and this exchange of interests was the unwritten motto of bush 's trip to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush received an ecstatic welcome from georgians whether the enthusiasm of the new democracies for " freedom man " bush can hold , will depend upon the success of the local reform powers .
under the protective influence of the eu , the economies in the baltic states is growing with ease .
but in georgia and ukraine the reform process will need a good deal of western help in order to bring about any long-term stability .
but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .
president bush 's trip was to a great extent merely symbolic , leaving it up to the former soviet countries to see how they fare in the democratic world . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .

and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .

" on the back of a third labor election victory , it is no surprise people feel pretty protective towards the guy , " purchase said .
" it is pretty clear he has still got the support of the majority of " his labor party in parliament . " put up or shut up " speaking outside the meeting , fellow lawmaker bob laxton told reporters his message to the rebels was " put up , shut up " or go away . one of blair 's closest allies , defense secretary john reid called it " a great meeting . " " the silent majority are silent no longer , " he said .
" they made their view known and you saw it in a standing ovation just now .
we have waited a while for the silent majority to speak but they have now spoken . " another ally of the prime minister , who has suffered a hostile start to his record third term in office , had urged blair earlier to woo critics by making symbolic concessions on iraq . stephen byers , a labor mp and former cabinet minister , said that blair should show he had " listened and learned " from iraq by giving parliament more power over sending troops to fight in future potential conflicts . lame duck leader ? last year blair , 52 , pledged that if he was re-elected he would serve a final , full term as leader before stepping down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown but some opponents see him as a lame duck leader who has lost the trust of the public due largely to the iraq invasion and its aftermath .
they yearn for a new boss , widely expected to be the finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown . byers , writing in the times before the meeting , reminded rebel labor mps of the trouble that blighted the main opposition conservative party after it ousted then-prime minister margaret thatcher in 1991 during her own third consecutive term in office . the party went on to suffer a hat trick of election defeats under a succession of different leaders , with the latest , michael howard , announcing last week that he will retire by the end of the year once a replacement is found . the house of commons was also wednesday to elect its speaker , an mp chosen to be a non-partisan chairman for debates , while members of parliament were to start being sworn into office . blair 's leadership was also challenged when european union deputies representing labor joined in a preliminary vote wednesday in strasbourg to scrap britain 's opt-out from eu rules limiting working hours . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair warns of german " victims ' culture " british prime minister tony blair described germany as a friend in an interview with a german tabloid monday , but warned germans not to foster a " victims ' culture " since the nazis started world war ii .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .
baden-württemberg relies on nuclear energy for 55 percent of its electricity .
replacing lost local nuclear power with imported nuclear power from france or restarting idled coal plants does not make sense , especially if germany wants to meet climate protection targets , gönner said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .
in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .
and in moscow , recognizing the need to appease the russian leadership which was silently smouldering at a further dent in its sphere of influence , bush took part in a victory celebration which was not devoid of the pomp , ceremony and glorification of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and russian premier vladimir putin wearing his american light-heartedness on his sleeve , bush sailed through the difficulties , sticking to his pedantically detailed schedule .
he made gestures big and small , embracing a soviet war veteran and accompanying president vladimir putin for a friendly spin in his soviet old-timer .
it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .
and this exchange of interests was the unwritten motto of bush 's trip to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush received an ecstatic welcome from georgians whether the enthusiasm of the new democracies for " freedom man " bush can hold , will depend upon the success of the local reform powers .
under the protective influence of the eu , the economies in the baltic states is growing with ease .
but in georgia and ukraine the reform process will need a good deal of western help in order to bring about any long-term stability .
but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .
president bush 's trip was to a great extent merely symbolic , leaving it up to the former soviet countries to see how they fare in the democratic world . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .
two down ...
17 to go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .
baden-württemberg relies on nuclear energy for 55 percent of its electricity .
replacing lost local nuclear power with imported nuclear power from france or restarting idled coal plants does not make sense , especially if germany wants to meet climate protection targets , gönner said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "

atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .
two down ...
17 to go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .
baden-württemberg relies on nuclear energy for 55 percent of its electricity .
replacing lost local nuclear power with imported nuclear power from france or restarting idled coal plants does not make sense , especially if germany wants to meet climate protection targets , gönner said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .

german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .

spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .

anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .

deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .

german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .

because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .

on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "

he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .
two down ...
17 to go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .
baden-württemberg relies on nuclear energy for 55 percent of its electricity .
replacing lost local nuclear power with imported nuclear power from france or restarting idled coal plants does not make sense , especially if germany wants to meet climate protection targets , gönner said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

" on the back of a third labor election victory , it is no surprise people feel pretty protective towards the guy , " purchase said .
" it is pretty clear he has still got the support of the majority of " his labor party in parliament . " put up or shut up " speaking outside the meeting , fellow lawmaker bob laxton told reporters his message to the rebels was " put up , shut up " or go away . one of blair 's closest allies , defense secretary john reid called it " a great meeting . " " the silent majority are silent no longer , " he said .
" they made their view known and you saw it in a standing ovation just now .
we have waited a while for the silent majority to speak but they have now spoken . " another ally of the prime minister , who has suffered a hostile start to his record third term in office , had urged blair earlier to woo critics by making symbolic concessions on iraq . stephen byers , a labor mp and former cabinet minister , said that blair should show he had " listened and learned " from iraq by giving parliament more power over sending troops to fight in future potential conflicts . lame duck leader ? last year blair , 52 , pledged that if he was re-elected he would serve a final , full term as leader before stepping down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown but some opponents see him as a lame duck leader who has lost the trust of the public due largely to the iraq invasion and its aftermath .
they yearn for a new boss , widely expected to be the finance minister , chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown . byers , writing in the times before the meeting , reminded rebel labor mps of the trouble that blighted the main opposition conservative party after it ousted then-prime minister margaret thatcher in 1991 during her own third consecutive term in office . the party went on to suffer a hat trick of election defeats under a succession of different leaders , with the latest , michael howard , announcing last week that he will retire by the end of the year once a replacement is found . the house of commons was also wednesday to elect its speaker , an mp chosen to be a non-partisan chairman for debates , while members of parliament were to start being sworn into office . blair 's leadership was also challenged when european union deputies representing labor joined in a preliminary vote wednesday in strasbourg to scrap britain 's opt-out from eu rules limiting working hours . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair warns of german " victims ' culture " british prime minister tony blair described germany as a friend in an interview with a german tabloid monday , but warned germans not to foster a " victims ' culture " since the nazis started world war ii .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .

german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .

that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2005 germany shuts down atomic reactor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jürgen trittin wants to shut off all nuclear plants germany closed down a second atomic reactor - also the country 's oldest - on wednesday .
the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .
two down ...
17 to go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .
the southern german state 's environment minister , tanja gönner , told reuters news agency she wants a discussion on the possible lengthening of running times of enbw 's remaining nuclear facilities in baden-württemberg .

the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power . after nearly 37 years in operation , germany 's oldest atomic reactor , in obrigheim , was disconnected on wednesday , baden-württemberg state officials said .
energie baden-württemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- said the shutdown would cost some 500 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- .
the three-phase shutdown process is expected to last until around 2020 , the company said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obrigheim nuclear plant obrigheim is the second reactor that was shut down as a result of national legislation agreed between the enbw and the red-green coalition government in the summer of 2000 .
the first to close was e.on 's 672 mw stade reactor , which was switched off in november 2003 .
the 340 megawatt obrigheim reactor will be prepared for final shut down over the course of the year .
there are 17 other atomic reactors still active in germany .
but despite the german energy policy , nuclear power is back in vogue elsewhere in europe .
atomic reactors produce almost no greenhouse gas emissions , unlike coal and gas power stations .
debated issue the policy of phasing out nuclear energy is still subject to debate , however .
industry and political opposition want it to be reviewed but the government is standing firm by the 2000 decision .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

in 2004 , hans weingartner 's " the edukators " was the first german movie entered in the competition since 1993 , when wim wenders presented " faraway , so close , " his sequel to " wings of desire . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2005 opinion : bush in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been a big face in europe these past days president bush has wrapped up his whirlwind european trip to mark the passing of the 60th anniversary of the wwii ceasefire .
it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .
in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .
and in moscow , recognizing the need to appease the russian leadership which was silently smouldering at a further dent in its sphere of influence , bush took part in a victory celebration which was not devoid of the pomp , ceremony and glorification of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and russian premier vladimir putin wearing his american light-heartedness on his sleeve , bush sailed through the difficulties , sticking to his pedantically detailed schedule .
he made gestures big and small , embracing a soviet war veteran and accompanying president vladimir putin for a friendly spin in his soviet old-timer .
it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .
and this exchange of interests was the unwritten motto of bush 's trip to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush received an ecstatic welcome from georgians whether the enthusiasm of the new democracies for " freedom man " bush can hold , will depend upon the success of the local reform powers .
under the protective influence of the eu , the economies in the baltic states is growing with ease .
but in georgia and ukraine the reform process will need a good deal of western help in order to bring about any long-term stability .
but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .
president bush 's trip was to a great extent merely symbolic , leaving it up to the former soviet countries to see how they fare in the democratic world . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .
the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .
-lrb- may 7 , 2005 -rrb- bush joins europe in recalling wwii sacrifices in addition to germany , a string of european countries remembered the sacrifices that underpinned the allied victory over nazi germany 60 years ago at parades and speeches sunday marking the end of world war ii .

it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .

some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support . a senior governor of the european central bank on tuesday criticized a top german politician for comparing some foreign investors to locusts , and a venture capitalist said the charge was harming germany as an investment location .
but people who support the chairman of the ruling social democrats , franz müntefering , point to the management shakeup this week at deutsche börse as representing exactly the kind of havoc foreign investors can wreak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering müntefering caused a stir last month when he said some foreign capitalists were chewing up german companies like locusts with no thought for the jobs they destroy .
because müntefering made the comment in the run-up to state elections , it was widely seen as a play for votes from the spd 's core working class electorate .
nonetheless , the " locust " comment sparked a loud and wide-ranging debate that has included everything from attacks on management pay and calls to boycott firms that sack workers , to condemnations of the remarks as anti-business and even anti-jewish in tone .
' why are we having this discussion ? '
on tuesday , in an interview with reuters news agency , european central bank governing council member klaus liebscher put in his two cents ' worth , calling the argument " strange . "
" i do not understand this discussion .
we need companies that make profits .
we know that only companies and corporations are able to create jobs , " the austrian ecb governor said .
" this is not done by politics .
political life can only give you the framework .
-lrb- job creation -rrb- is done by the corporate sector .
i do not understand how , if you want to be attractive to foreign investors , why you have a discussion like that in germany . "
he added : " i hope they know what they are doing .
but i am not quite sure . "
deutsche börse fueling the fire earlier on tuesday , the german private equity and venture capital association told reporters that müntefering 's remarks were unhelpful to those trying to promote germany as a place to invest .
" it is certainly not helping to improve its attractiveness , " association head thomas pütter told a conference in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner seifert , -lrb- l . -rrb- , und rolf breuer -lrb- r . -rrb-
yet the ousting this week of deutsche börse ceo werner seifert and another board member under pressure from foreign shareholders was seen by müntefering supporters as an example of the disturbing power of foreign investors .
" that these investors evidently can wield such power confirms our fears , " said joahim poss , a senior spd official .
' nameless profiteers ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles left-wing spd deputy andrea nahles told reuters : " i see -lrb- the börse shakeup -rrb- as confirmation of franz müntefering 's argument .
it 's mainly about short-term profit maximisation by people who remain nameless , " she said .
german economy minister wolfgang clement urged more transparency after shareholders led by the british hedge fund tci expelled the deutsche börse chief and supervisory board chairman rolf breuer on monday .
" no one can see from the outside precisely what happened .
that 's what makes it so uncertain and what affects the judgement of the situation , " he said at an event in stuttgart .
" all i can do is point out that it is important that financial funds - hedge funds for example - that operate here , should be as transparent as possible , " he said .
private equity as last option critics of müntefering say germany needs more foreign investment and point out that private equity firms are often the only alternative left to companies desperately in need of capital to survive .
" private equity is the capital market 's answer to the need for change in an economy .
an economy should make use of private equity , " said puetter . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de critiquing capitalism across europe how much capitalism is too much ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2005 opinion : bush in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has been a big face in europe these past days president bush has wrapped up his whirlwind european trip to mark the passing of the 60th anniversary of the wwii ceasefire .
it was a tour of firsts , and not without historical meaning . bush has rarely shown such a relaxed face on official overseas visits as on this trip to europe . in georgia , national dancers wooed him into the small hours , causing him to swing his hips with a vigour more reminiscent of texas than tbilisi . but then again , the latest developments in the region are worth celebration .
with the rose revolution in georgia and the orange revolution in ukraine , the shores of the caspian sea have been washed free of tyranny .
in the past 18 months , the democratic desires of both countries ' populations propelled mikhail saakashvili and victor yushchenko to the helms of their national ships .
and america approves . six decades after the end of wwii , the divisions on the continent appear to have been overcome and the yalta pact consigned to the annals of time .
in part , at least , bush 's visit was designed to celebrate the historic progress and lavish praise upon the democratic will of the european people . his gesture was as well-received in the baltics as in tbilisi .
and in moscow , recognizing the need to appease the russian leadership which was silently smouldering at a further dent in its sphere of influence , bush took part in a victory celebration which was not devoid of the pomp , ceremony and glorification of the soviet union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george bush and russian premier vladimir putin wearing his american light-heartedness on his sleeve , bush sailed through the difficulties , sticking to his pedantically detailed schedule .
he made gestures big and small , embracing a soviet war veteran and accompanying president vladimir putin for a friendly spin in his soviet old-timer .
it was a statement which seemed to recognize russian pride and the suffering of america 's war-time allies . besides all this , bush managed to pay a visit to the netherlands , as if he were trying to say he has n't forgotten about " old europe " either .
and it was a smart move , because bush needs them all .
in the fight against terror , the ports of rotterdam and riga are almost as important as adequately securing what 's left of the soviet nuclear arsenal in russia or ukraine . despite the satisfaction over securing a place for the baltic states in the atlantic alliance , the security partnership with moscow must remain intact .
and this exchange of interests was the unwritten motto of bush 's trip to europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush received an ecstatic welcome from georgians whether the enthusiasm of the new democracies for " freedom man " bush can hold , will depend upon the success of the local reform powers .
under the protective influence of the eu , the economies in the baltic states is growing with ease .
but in georgia and ukraine the reform process will need a good deal of western help in order to bring about any long-term stability .
but there is no sign of a new marshall plan for the region , and whether the universal push for freedom and the striving for democracy are enough to bring about historical change , remains to be seen . what should therefore follow grand gestures such as the us presidential tour , are international efforts to turn peaceful revolutions into economic success stories , thus permanently ruling out any return to authoritarian structures .
president bush 's trip was to a great extent merely symbolic , leaving it up to the former soviet countries to see how they fare in the democratic world . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .
the countries ' leaders said in a joint interview that germany was responsible for the war , adding that it also suffered greatly .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2005 eads new chiefs leave airbus hanging großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is without a boss since france 's forgeard will co-chair eads the european aeronautic defense and space company held an annual meeting wednesday riven with franco-german tensions as noel forgeard was poised to co-pilot eads without a successor to replace him at airbus . noel forgeard , the french current chief executive of subsidiary airbus , and thomas enders , the german head of the defense division at eads , were set to replace co-ceos philippe camus and rainer hertrich at the company 's annual general meeting . " give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .

but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .
-lrb- april 29 , 2005 -rrb- germany shuts down atomic reactor germany will close down a second atomic reactor - also the country 's oldest - on wednesday .
the move is part of a government policy to phase out nuclear power .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 11.05.2005 is harry heretical ? the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply .

now , news of a radioactive leak at the sellafield reprocessing plant in northwestern england has lent the commission 's arguments more strength .
enough nuclear waste " to half-fill an olympic-sized swimming pool " leaked from a cracked pipe at the plant , according to a report in british daily the guardian .
the fluid , a uranium and plutonium fuel in concentrated nitric acid seeping from a broken pipe into a steel chamber is so dangerously radioactive that special robots may have to be built to clean up the mess , officials said .
the lead occured on april 18 , causing part of the sellafield facility to be shut down two days later .
but the news only hit headlines this week , leading the eu to renew calls for unified safety legislation . " the recent sellafield incident shows once more that the eu should be allowed overall framework control for the safety of nuclear installations , " energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in a statement .
" it is not possible to continue to function efficiently in relation to the varying national legislation in force .
in an area as sensitive as nuclear energy , it is essential to show the greatest form of transparency . "
running afoul of the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plant in france .
atomic energy is still popular in europe .
it is n't the first time that sellafield has provoked the eu .
last year , eu commissioners threatened legal action after britain refused to give eu inspectors access to the entire reprocessing plant .
former eu energy commissioner loyola de palacio had pushed for unified and tougher safety standards but amended the commission 's controversial proposals .
the revised rules would require members to create plans for dealing with radioactive waste , though a commission-imposed deadline for those plans was dropped after opposition from england and germany .
germany , meanwhile , decided to close a second atomic reactor as part of a government plan to phase out nuclear power altogether .
the reactor , in obrigheim in southern germany , is the oldest one in germany and was in operation for 37 years . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam .

fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .

" give us the time to find good people , " eads german co-chairman manfred bischoff told shareholders at the meeting at company headquarters in amsterdam . " there must be a boss at airbus , " french co-ceo camus told radio bfm , voicing confidence that the group would resolve the impasse .
managing the franco-german corporate structure " is complicated , " he acknowledged , but when it happens " it works very well . " while the decision to name forgeard and enders as the new co-chairmen of the eads parent company had been announced in december , french and german shareholders , each with a stake of 30 percent in the group , have yet to iron out differences on forgeard 's successor at airbus . balancing nationalities nonetheless , two names have surfaced as the potential airbus chief .
fabrice bregier , the current head of eurocopter , has the backing of german-us carmaker daimlerchrysler , an eads shareholder , provided he is replaced by a german at the helicopter subsidiary .
in another scenario , france would agree to let airbus fall to german leadership by giving the reins to gustav humbert , now chief operating officer at the toulouse-based aircraft maker . in the absence of consensus , one solution would be to allow forgeard to combine his joint leadership of eads with the chief executive 's job at airbus .
but german shareholders are said to oppose such an arrangement on grounds that it violates terms of their pact .
still , the new leadership at eads could decide to let forgeard continue to wear his airbus hat temporarily until agreement is reached on a permanent airbus leader , a source close to the matter said here wednesday . if a german is eventually chosen to head airbus , the announcement may not come until after a may 29 referendum on the european constitution in france in order not to aggravate french national feelings .
airbus roused french pride on april 25 in toulouse with the successful maiden flight of its a380 , the world 's biggest airliner capable of carrying 800 passengers and a key arm in its battle with us rival boeing .
the french government , which is campaigning for a yes vote on the eu constitution , would prefer an announcement on the future leader of airbus at a later date , said a government analyst who requested anonymity .
bildunterschrift : aroused pride in france : the airbus a380 fierce competition the incoming franco-german duo at eads , forgeard and enders , meanwhile face dual challenges : keeping airbus flying high against us rival boeing and building defense business .
they inherit a group that since its creation in july 2000 has dethroned boeing on the commercial airliner market and undertaken ambitious industrial challenges , such as the airbus a380 , the world 's biggest airliner , the airbus a400m military transport aircraft , attack helicopters , missiles and satellites . airbus scored a watershed victory over boeing in 2003 by delivering for the first time more commercial planes than its rival .
and airbus , which maintained its lead in 2004 , intends to keep it . the transatlantic duel is being fought against the background of the persistently weak dollar , the currency of reference in the aeronautics sector .
the situation leaves the european aircraft maker , which incurs costs in euros , at a disadvantage . determined to break boeing 's monopoly on the 747 jumbo jet market , airbus launched the a380 program at a cost of more than 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.87 billion -rrb- .
boeing took a different tack , focusing on the long-haul , medium-capacity market with the launch of the 787 dreamliner last year .
production is to begin in 2006 , with the first flight in 2007 and first delivery in 2008 .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . since the introduction of homeopathic treatment in egypt , we have had major successes with patients in the treatment of chronic conditions .
it has led to the establishment of a scientific society of homeopathic medicine with a view to providing evidence based proof of the efficacy of homeopathic treatment . as a practitioner we see daily evidence of success in acute and chronic treatment of a whole range of medical conditions -lrb- and some failures as well , of course -rrb- but on the whole it is a safe and effective mode of treatment that should be expanded . " at least , do no harm " was hippocrates ' dictum for the physician . this can be said of homeopathy but , unfortunately , not modern allopathic medicine , which , according to the journal of the american medical association is the cause of approximately 200,000 medically induced deaths per year in the us alone . society needs to investigate effective alternatives to a system which is increasingly expensive and dangerous . lammert holdijk i am a practicing homeopath and can site innumerable cases that have been helped by homoeopathy and the results proved on the basis of objective evidences in the form of laboratory investigations , radiological evidence etc .
the cases range from chronic cold to diabetes to multi-system disorders .
those who do not believe in homoeopathy should also think in terms of limitations of today 's science .
dr. ajey d. jogalekar gay marriage i believe that germany should legalize gay marriage . -lrb- my partner and i -rrb- were married in canada and have been together for 10 years . we have few civil rights in the usa and are being taken over by the far religious right . i hope that does n't happen in europe .
we want the same rights and freedom to love and protect our relationship that heterosexual couples enjoy .
carol o 'brien canada legalized gay marriage about two years ago .
spain is following canada 's admirable example .
while most northern european countries allow some kind of civil union for gays , there wo n't be full equality until gay marriage is legalized .
so germany should definitely follow the example of canada and spain and at least make an effort to legalize gay marriage .
anurama harry potter yes , yes , yes - thanks be to god for our wonderful pope who warns us of the evil contained in the pages of harry potter books . evil is generally presented as attractive , appealing and popular . i know many good catholics who believe these books are harmless fun . but they are not harmless . janet wain no question , the pope is right . not because he is the pope , but because any amount of black magic is too much .
under the guise of harmless entertainment , the potter books start too many young people on the road to hell . and even if they do n't do that , they vulgarize young and impressionable minds with violence and unacceptable behavior .
rosalie dancause i do not appreciate the pope 's views on harry potter books .
everyone has an imagination and just because this book is " filled " with too much black magic , does not mean it is sinful to read .
yes , if you read the book and attempt to live your life by that black magic , of course , that would not be putting god first in your life .
anything , subject , object , or thought that takes the place of the trinity in your life can be damaging .
but a strong foundation should not be shaken by words of a fictional book .
deborah williamson i think the pope should express himself as leader of the church on earth .
however , my view is that the harry potter books are not nearly as harmful as " the da vinci code . "
that book blasphemes against our lord and therefore , i think he should blast out against that book more than the completely fictional harry potter series which most people read as fun and do n't take seriously any more than snow white or cinderella .
martha dancy i believe pope benedict xvi will work diligently at rooting out evil in all of its manifestations - wherever it exists today . certainly the harry potter books have been responsible for many innocent souls opening themselves up to the dark side of the spirit world . his condemnation of these books would be a bold and courageous first step in clearly spelling out what the church teaches in regard to good and evil . st. benedict was extremely powerful in standing up against the forces of evil in the sixth century , and i feel that pope benedict will follow closely in his footsteps in our modern world . mary kay mahowald , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : homeopathy seeks more acknowledgement while meeting with practitioners of homeopathy from over 40 countries at a congress in berlin , the german association of homeopathic doctors demanded wider recognition for the 200-year-old alternative medical science .
-lrb- april 6 , 2005 -rrb- dw-world : spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- dw-world : pope versus potter in reading ring just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . -lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback feedback : if you would like to comment on this or any other story , do not hesitate to contact us and please include your full name and country of residence in any reply . picture of the day dw-tv europe live euromaxx - lifestyle europe we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

gps and vets are working together to discuss what kind of role the animal can play in healthcare .
there have been anecdotal reports of dogs spotting cancer in their owners , but now researchers say they have proved this phenomenon scientifically .
jeni mcaughey from the royal college of general practitioners said dogs do make an important contribution .
" i think it is an interesting study and is one where we will need further research done to see how this will fit into other methods of detecting cancer , " she said .
" but obviously , if we have got a method that is non-invasive and does n't cause patients any trouble or any pain , it would be a big help to detecting problems . "
she added : " i think it is tremendously exciting that dogs are actually picking things up that tests miss , because unfortunately all our tests are not infallible . "
cancers are thought to produce distinctive odours .
even when present in minute quantities , it is possible that dogs , with their exceptional sense of smell , might be able to detect these odours .
urine samples scientists at amersham hospital , buckinghamshire , conducted a carefully controlled experiment to see whether dogs could be trained to spot bladder cancer based on the odour of urine samples .
over seven months , they trained six dogs of varying breeds and ages to discriminate between urine from patients with bladder cancer and urine from patients without bladder cancer .
on nine different occasions , each dog was offered a set of seven urine samples , of which only one came from a patient with bladder cancer .
overall , the dogs correctly selected the bladder cancer urine on 22 out of 54 occasions .
this success rate of 41 % was significantly more than the 14 % that could be expected by chance alone .
the scientists ' results appeared in the british medical journal last september .
they hope to build a tool that is as good at discerning cancer smells as dogs ' noses .

the news came as nab , australia 's biggest bank by assets , reported a 12.5 % drop in first-half cash earnings .
nab owns clydesdale and yorkshire banks and had already announced plans to cut 1,700 jobs in the uk .
glasgow-based clydesdale bank will lose 60 of 217 branches and yorkshire will lose 40 sites - a fifth of its network .
however , nab said it was planning to expand its operations in the south east of england .
tough times the job cuts are proving controversial and australian treasurer peter costello said he wanted a " good explanation " . "
we have had to move with the times " david thorburn , clydesdale bank nab is looking to keep ahead of rivals , such as commonwealth bank of australia and westpac banking , which have been putting in a better performance .
the bank is still recovering from a trading scandal that broke at the start of 2004 when it emerged the company had currency dealing losses of $ 184m -lrb- £ 98m -rrb- .
it is also facing increased competition in australia and europe , rising uk pension costs and a bureaucratic structure , analysts said .
speaking about the planned job losses on national radio , mr costello said that the bank " better have a pretty good explanation because the nab is a highly profitable organisation " .
" i feel for people who have lost their jobs , " he said .
nab is looking to trim about 4,200 staff from its australian and british operations , or about 10 % of the workforce .
" the national is profitable , it is privileged and it is powerful , " said paul schroder , the national secretary of australia 's finance sector union .
" there is no case for cutting jobs .

a system of forced labour based on the soviet gulags was instituted throughout china soon after the communists came to power in 1949 , with the emphasis on remoulding " bad elements " into " new socialist persons " .

but the use of compulsory labour as a means of reform and re-education - both within and outside the regular prison system - remains very much in place .
the purpose of china 's network of prison camps and labour farms is brainwashing , according to bob fu , a pastor who was detained for " illegal religious activities " .

" but the basic system remains what it always was - a tool to help a totalitarian regime maintain control , " he says .
some of mr wu 's claims have been criticised by other observers as exaggerated or out-dated .
his estimates of the total number of inmates have ranged from four million to 20 million .
but many believe the true figure today to be around two million - which is fewer than the number behind bars in the united states .
as for using " slave labour " to conquer the world 's markets , prison goods are in fact thought to play a very minor role in china 's exports - if only because their quality is too low .
while some prison officers may be lining their own pockets , the system as a whole runs at a loss .
prison labour , moreover , is not in itself against international law .
' re-education ' what really concerns international rights groups are the often appalling conditions in the camps and the arbitrary way in which people are sent there .

and only a small proportion these days are political prisoners -lrb- china denies it holds any at all -rrb- .
but anyone can be held under a form of detention known as " re-education through labour " with no trial or sentencing procedure of any kind .
this system allows police to send people to labour camps for up to four years on a variety of vaguely-defined offences without having to present a case to prosecutors or judges .
about 300,000 people - the highest number ever - are currently held under this system in some 300 camps .
the wide police discretion has made re-education through labour a key weapon in crackdowns against unauthorised religious groups and separatist-minded ethnic minorities .
other targets include drug addicts , prostitutes , " hooligans and lazy people " and even , according to one regulation , people who have extra-marital affairs .
falun gong , the spiritual movement banned as a cult , says tens of thousands of its followers have been held in these camps , with many subjected to torture .
more than 1,000 of them have died , it says .
human rights groups have been unable to confirm those deaths but say there are frequent reports of physical abuse by guards using electric batons and by cell bosses selected to " maintain order " over fellow inmates .
' black hole ' meg davis of human rights watch , who visited a labour camp for drug-users in the south-western province of yunnan , described it as unclean and seriously overcrowded .
" it was also highly militarised like something from the mao era , with inmates marching round chanting slogans , " she said .
sweatshops were turning out fake diamonds for sale to tourists , she said .
some of the harshest conditions are found in the labour farms and prison mines in remote western regions such as xinjiang , according to james seymour , co-author of new ghosts old ghosts - prison and labor in china and a research scholar at the chinese university of hong kong . "
there are a lot of reform efforts going on , but without independent access self-medication will not cure the system " nicolas becquelin human rights in china " chinese mines in general are notorious for their poor working conditions and frequent accidents .
and there 's evidence that the prison mines are even worse than the civilian ones , " he said .
but the biggest problem , he believes , is that it is often the wrong people who are detained in the first place .
the chinese government is now debating legislation to reform the re-education through labour system .
" the power to send someone to prison should belong to a court , " xu zhiyong , a beijing law professor , told bbc news .
the proposed reforms could happen by the end of this year , he said , but face opposition from certain departments .
whatever happens , it is likely to be old wine in a new bottle .
the lack of any internal checks on abuses or access by inmates to lawyers mean china will still to fail to meet international standards on detention and forced labour , rights groups say .

" the key issue for us is that the prison / detention facilities are a black hole " , says nicolas becquelin , research director of human rights in china .
" nobody can visit them , not even the international red cross .

the anniversary of the public opening will be marked on 12 may .
tate director sir nicholas serota talks to bbc news about how the tate modern has brought art to a wider audience , and offers his views on the museum 's future direction .
what have been the gallery 's triumphs since opening ?
i think its greatest achievement is to make london part of a european art world .
tate modern and tate britain have contributed to a change in the way that britain sees art , and the way the world sees britain .
we thought that we would get three million visitors in the first year and then drop back to two million , and we would have been pleased with that number .
but to stay at over four million each year has been remarkable .
what is the tate modern 's appeal ?
the building is an accessible , democratic space - impressive but not oppressive .
it has attracted a new audience to modern art and is of particular appeal to young people , who come as much for the building and its atmosphere as to look at the collection .
in 2004 , 60 % of tate modern 's visitors were under 35 .
what lessons have been learned ?
how important it is that museums should be accessible to all .
we were particularly fortunate that the government , under chris smith , provided enough funding to enable tate modern to be free .
this has been a major contribution to its success .
what do you think of modern art ?
what is the museum 's current status in the world of contemporary art ?
in terms of visitors , it is the most popular museum of modern art in the world .
the tate modern attracts more than four million visitors each year this puts it ahead of the centre pompidou in paris -lrb- 3.5 million visitors a year -rrb- and the museum of modern art in new york -lrb- 1 million visitors from november 2004 to march 2005 -rrb- , the guggenheim in new york -lrb- just under 1 million visitors a year -rrb- and guggenheim bilbao -lrb- 900,000 visitors a year -rrb- .
tate 's collection is one of the four most important collections of modern art in the world .
we are anxious to maintain its status and we recently launched a campaign to raise a collection endowment to enable us to continue to make major acquisitions .
where will the tate modern go from here ?
much of the potential of tate modern still remains to be developed .
some of this promise will eventually be realised by our project completing tate modern over the next five years .
we plan to develop the derelict areas to the south of the turbine hall , currently occupied by an electricity substation , and create a new building to the south designed by herzog & de meuron .
i believe that the experience of contemporary art can provide insights into ourselves and into our culture this will provide new kinds of display space for media such as photography , film , video and digital art , improved facilities for visitors , and spaces for learning and for our younger visitors .
our aim is to establish a cultural quarter of international significance at bankside and achieve a better integration of tate modern into its surrounding community - improving access and allowing the regenerative impact of tate modern to spread further southwards .
what are your predictions for contemporary art as a genre ?
public interest in all aspects of visual culture is greater than ever before , particularly for new media such as photography , video and digital art .
i believe that the experience of contemporary art can provide insights into ourselves and into our culture .
the gallery is situated on london 's south bank for some people that experience will be more vivid where the language employed is the common language of conversation , or the vision closely related to what is seen in the street , on television or in the newspapers .
each encounter will be personal , shaped by our own histories , identities and experience .
if a work of art is capable of provoking such a response then its value is immeasurable .
which is your favourite exhibit and why ?
it depends on the day : one day it will be the recently acquired four seasons by cy twombly , another it will bruce nauman 's installation raw materials in the turbine hall .
on another it could be doris salcedo 's eloquent tribute to the ' disappeared ' from her native colombia , or picasso 's three dancers .
what artworks would you really like to be displayed at the tate modern ?
we need to be able to show exhibitions by the great masters , such as mondrian or malevich , as well as new work by the youngest artists of today and work by established figures such as katharina fritsch , luc tuymans and jeff wall .
what has surprised you about people 's response to art at the gallery ?
the unilever series of commissions for the turbine hall has been unexpectedly popular with more than 9.5 million people visiting the installations by bourgeios , muñoz , kapoor , eliasson and nauman .

the anniversary of the public opening will be marked on 12 may .
tate director sir nicholas serota talks to bbc news about how the tate modern has brought art to a wider audience , and offers his views on the museum 's future direction .
what have been the gallery 's triumphs since opening ?
i think its greatest achievement is to make london part of a european art world .
tate modern and tate britain have contributed to a change in the way that britain sees art , and the way the world sees britain .
we thought that we would get three million visitors in the first year and then drop back to two million , and we would have been pleased with that number .
but to stay at over four million each year has been remarkable .
what is the tate modern 's appeal ?
the building is an accessible , democratic space - impressive but not oppressive .
it has attracted a new audience to modern art and is of particular appeal to young people , who come as much for the building and its atmosphere as to look at the collection .
in 2004 , 60 % of tate modern 's visitors were under 35 .
what lessons have been learned ?
how important it is that museums should be accessible to all .
we were particularly fortunate that the government , under chris smith , provided enough funding to enable tate modern to be free .
this has been a major contribution to its success .
what do you think of modern art ?
what is the museum 's current status in the world of contemporary art ?
in terms of visitors , it is the most popular museum of modern art in the world .
the tate modern attracts more than four million visitors each year this puts it ahead of the centre pompidou in paris -lrb- 3.5 million visitors a year -rrb- and the museum of modern art in new york -lrb- 1 million visitors from november 2004 to march 2005 -rrb- , the guggenheim in new york -lrb- just under 1 million visitors a year -rrb- and guggenheim bilbao -lrb- 900,000 visitors a year -rrb- .
tate 's collection is one of the four most important collections of modern art in the world .
we are anxious to maintain its status and we recently launched a campaign to raise a collection endowment to enable us to continue to make major acquisitions .
where will the tate modern go from here ?
much of the potential of tate modern still remains to be developed .
some of this promise will eventually be realised by our project completing tate modern over the next five years .
we plan to develop the derelict areas to the south of the turbine hall , currently occupied by an electricity substation , and create a new building to the south designed by herzog & de meuron .
i believe that the experience of contemporary art can provide insights into ourselves and into our culture this will provide new kinds of display space for media such as photography , film , video and digital art , improved facilities for visitors , and spaces for learning and for our younger visitors .
our aim is to establish a cultural quarter of international significance at bankside and achieve a better integration of tate modern into its surrounding community - improving access and allowing the regenerative impact of tate modern to spread further southwards .

the trials by ntl broadcast and o2 start in oxford from july and will run for six months to test 16 channels .
all 350 testers will be able to see shows from the discovery channel , cnn , the cartoon network and a short-film channel called shorts international .
the trial will look at how people use the service , which uses a special mobile broadcast transmission standard .
dvb-h -lrb- digital video broadcast - handheld -rrb- is a standard which has been specifically developed for the broadcast of tv signals on mobiles and other handheld devices .
channels announced so far bskyb -lrb- sky news , sky sports news , sky travel -rrb- chart show channels ltd -lrb- chart show tv -rrb- discovery networks europe -lrb- discovery channel -rrb- shorts international -lrb- shorts tv - a bespoke short film channel -rrb- turner broadcasting -lrb- cnn , cartoon network -rrb- it lets mobiles , which have special requirements because of screen size and battery life , handle tv signals in real-time .
" we know from our own research that well over half of uk mobile users are very interested in watching their favourite tv programmes on their mobiles , which is why we are aiming to put together such a compelling channel line-up , " said terry howard , head of media business development at ntl broadcast .
mobile companies are keen to take advantage of mobile tv as a way of making more money .
but they are not as clear about how people will use the services , or whether people will be willing to pay to watch tv on such small devices with limited battery life .
mr howard said ntl broadcast and o2 were looking forward to welcoming more channel providers and terrestrial broadcasters to the trial .
testing time the dvb-h standard is different to how video is received and watched on mobiles currently , which is via streaming or download services , because it sends live broadcast signals directly to phones .
it also allows broadcasters to send the same signals to multiple handsets .
" we believe that mobile broadcast tv has the potential to sit alongside our existing customer services based on gprs -lrb- 2.5g -rrb- and 3g mobile data networks , " said dave williams , o2 's chief technology officer .
" mobile broadcast tv aims to be a cost effective method for transmitting high quality content from one source to multiple customers whereas 3g is ideal for providing bespoke content to users . "
time slicing technology the testers in oxford will all use the nokia 7710 handset .

the testers will be given a nokia 7710 handset to try out the service the trial is intended to give the mobile industry in the uk a better picture of how people would choose use tv on their phones while on the move .
it will also provide useful research for ofcom , the uk 's communications regulator , which would need to arrange licences for use of the country 's broadcast spectrum if commercial services were to be launched .
the dvb-h standard is currently being tested by us , germany , france , finland , sweden and others .
more trials expected to launch later in 2005 and throughout 2006 .
dvb-h uses a technology called " time slicing " to allow up to eight hours of tv to be watched on one battery charge .
time slicing only sends the information needed for the one channel of content which is being watched , which means less power is used .
but dvb-h is in competition with another mobile tv technology called digital multimedia broadcasting -lrb- dmb -rrb- .
the japanese , south koreans and ericsson of sweden back dmb because they say the technology drain batteries even less and it handles more frames a second .
mobile companies are expected to have about 51 million users of mobile tv by 2009 , making an estimated $ 6.6bn -lrb- £ 3.5bn -rrb- in revenue , according to technology us consultancy strategy analytics .
