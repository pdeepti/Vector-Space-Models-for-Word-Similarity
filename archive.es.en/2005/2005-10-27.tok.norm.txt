the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 final compensation pending for former nazi forced laborers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers came from many countries to be slaves for germany some 60 years after the horrors of slavery under the third reich , 1.6 million former forced laborers have received compensation .
while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .

" our emergency aid has been completely exhausted .

germany has promised a total of 20 million euros and has so far contributed 20 percent of the eu ’ s 13.6 million euros of aid . wieczorek-zeul also called on the german public to give more in donations for the earthquake victims .
" it may not be that those people who survived have to die as a result of the disaster . "
huge donations from the german public to the tsunami stricken areas in south asia at the start of the year helped to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and saved survivors of the actual event from becoming victims of its aftermath . un conference leads to increased international aid meanwhile , the international community raised its initial pledge of aid to $ 580 million after the united nations donors ' conference in geneva on wednesday .
the increased aid came after un secretary general kofi annan made a dramatic appeal for more support .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .

the ongoing war in the breakaway republic of chechnya , she added , remained an added irritation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnyans protest against putin in berlin " people are still disappearing at an alarming rate , perhaps the highest rate in the world , " she said .
" we feel that the russian government should be investigating and prosecuting the troops that are responsible for such atrocities and we would hope that the german government would press to take these steps . " bogert 's demands vis-à-vis berlin are anything but new .
but there 's a feeling that a new coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel might lead to a real readjustment of this country 's foreign policy guidelines towards the kremlin . " i think that the recent intensity and nature of german-russian relations has been heavily dependent on the friendly relations between outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , " said marianne heuwagen , who heads the new human rights watch office in berlin .
" angela merkel will of course not completely change bilateral relations between berlin and moscow .
but if her eastern background is anything to go by , she 'll be more likely not to bring up the chechnya issue . " co n cer n s about chi n a carroll bogert said she is also hoping that the german government will be more courageous in addressing human rights issues having regarding china .
the outgoing schröder government had been in the firing line for dodging human rights violations in china so as not to jeopardize lucrative business contracts with beijing . " i think the critical issue is one of rejecting the position that business is business and that business with china must be done and that nothing can get in its way , " she said , adding that china 's restrictive internet policy was something western business leaders should be concerned about as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese internet users are not free to surf the web as the please " it 's obvious that much of the business that western companies , german companies included , want to do in china , is going to rely on - among other things - freedom of expression and the ability to use the internet , " she said . unlike the acting german government , human rights watch is strongly in favor of upholding the arms embargo against china as imposed by the european union after the massacre in tiananmen square in 1989 .
it says the embargo should stay in place unless the chinese government paves the way for genuine investigations into the massacre and brings to justice those responsible for the bloodshed . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder defends pipeline project outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder has defended joint german-russian plans to build an underwater gas pipeline in the face of criticism from lithuania .

" from left to right , there 's no political movement in poland that accepts the center , " said dieter bingen , who directs the german poland institute in darmstadt . bdv to blame for polish sta n d ? he added that talking about the expulsion of people from the former eastern parts of the german reich was not taboo in poland , but " such a center , set up under the leadership of the bdv , can not be sold to the polish public .

" we do n't tell the french or the british or the poles how they are supposed to deal with their history , " she said .
" one can expect neighbors to be treated the same . " pointing to the cdu 's election program , she added that she expected germany 's next government to support the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center would focus not only focus on the expulsion of germans " in the spirit of reconciliation , we want to make a statement with a center against expulsions in berlin in order to remind of the injustice of expulsion and outlaw future expulsions at the same time , " the program read . but it 's questionable whether the federal government will financially support the center in the future . the social democrats , the likely junior partner in the next government , does n't even want to express verbal backing for the project .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2005 eu leaders face up to asian challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are waking up to rising confidence in china and india eu leaders sought thursday to thrash out a strategy to drag europe out of its economic malaise and avoid being overtaken by rising asian giants china and india . the leaders , meeting amid the tudor opulence of hampton court palace outside london , are under pressure to deliver more than talk with economists saying that action is long overdue . british finance minister gordon brown urged leaders to seize the chance at the summit to push ahead with long-stalled reforms aimed at injecting dynamism into europe 's lethargic economies . " the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 end-of-life care neglected in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a minority of the terminally ill are cared for in hospices a raging debate about assisted suicide in germany has drawn attention to the generally poor care that the terminally ill receive . last week , health minister ulla schmidt pledged 250 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to improve and expand hospices and palliative care in the germany .
the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 germany to pledge more aid for quake victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of homeless people in the stricken areas are still in danger germany wants to dramatically raise its financial aid in a bid to help overwhelmed emergency services and exhausted funding operations in the quake devastated areas of pakistan and india . german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul told the berliner zeitung on thursday that germany aimed to increase its aid .
" our emergency aid has been completely exhausted .
i have applied to the federal minister of finance for an extension of five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- . "
germany has promised a total of 20 million euros and has so far contributed 20 percent of the eu ’ s 13.6 million euros of aid . wieczorek-zeul also called on the german public to give more in donations for the earthquake victims .
" it may not be that those people who survived have to die as a result of the disaster . "
huge donations from the german public to the tsunami stricken areas in south asia at the start of the year helped to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and saved survivors of the actual event from becoming victims of its aftermath . un conference leads to increased international aid meanwhile , the international community raised its initial pledge of aid to $ 580 million after the united nations donors ' conference in geneva on wednesday .
the increased aid came after un secretary general kofi annan made a dramatic appeal for more support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 final compensation pending for former nazi forced laborers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers came from many countries to be slaves for germany some 60 years after the horrors of slavery under the third reich , 1.6 million former forced laborers have received compensation .
while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .

" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .

for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2005 eu leaders face up to asian challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are waking up to rising confidence in china and india eu leaders sought thursday to thrash out a strategy to drag europe out of its economic malaise and avoid being overtaken by rising asian giants china and india . the leaders , meeting amid the tudor opulence of hampton court palace outside london , are under pressure to deliver more than talk with economists saying that action is long overdue . british finance minister gordon brown urged leaders to seize the chance at the summit to push ahead with long-stalled reforms aimed at injecting dynamism into europe 's lethargic economies . " the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "
although eu leaders widely agree that the right model for europe is a " social market economy " , interpretations of what that means vary widely . " the nordics are in an enviable position with a social model bearing both efficiency and equity while the mediterraneans live in a model that bears neither , " said andre sapir a respected authority on the subject at the brussels-based economic think-tank bruegel . while the british and american free-market model has the advantage of flexibility it leaves too many citizens behind , in sapir 's view . " the anglo-saxons have an efficient but unfair social model while the continentals enjoy much more equity but weaker efficiency " , sapir said . lack of response could be fatal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly efficient work practices in china could leave the eu behind however , inefficiency was a crippling handicap in the global race to get ahead , sapir said . " the models that are inefficient are simply not sustainable in the face of the growing tensions on public finances coming from globalization , technological change and population aging , " he said . bank of american economist lorenzo codogno warned against imitating various models and recommended adapting each country 's system to the challenges of globalization . " the us model way is not to be followed blindly but also the scandinavian way is not " to be simply imitated , he said . " the reform process needs to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual country while maintaining an eu-wide coordination , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to grapple with globalization at summit european union leaders gather thursday in the splendor of a 16th-century english palace for a free-wheeling debate on how to spur growth and create jobs in a 21st century defined by globalization .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .

but what would you make of a masseuse approaching you in a bar and offering to give some instant stress relief ? while the practice may be common in certain types of bars in thailand , this kind of thing does not happen very often in europe , at least in reputable places .
but instances are on the rise especially in germany .
pub massages are becoming increasingly popular all across the country . the neck attack company started off in germany in stuttgart in 2004 after the australian fad of pub massage made its way over to europe in the tales of incredulous european backpackers .
the founders of neck attack have since expanded their staff from just two to more than 60 as the business has grown and spread nationwide . no fixed price for ten minutes of relaxation the trained masseuses and physiotherapists offer a range of thai , shiatsu and ayurveda massage and depending on how much they enjoyed it , how much they have left after ordering drinks or how much alcohol they have consumed , punters pay a little or a lot for a rub .
there is no fixed price for the massages which tend to last between five and ten minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2005 eu leaders face up to asian challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are waking up to rising confidence in china and india eu leaders sought thursday to thrash out a strategy to drag europe out of its economic malaise and avoid being overtaken by rising asian giants china and india . the leaders , meeting amid the tudor opulence of hampton court palace outside london , are under pressure to deliver more than talk with economists saying that action is long overdue . british finance minister gordon brown urged leaders to seize the chance at the summit to push ahead with long-stalled reforms aimed at injecting dynamism into europe 's lethargic economies . " the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "
although eu leaders widely agree that the right model for europe is a " social market economy " , interpretations of what that means vary widely . " the nordics are in an enviable position with a social model bearing both efficiency and equity while the mediterraneans live in a model that bears neither , " said andre sapir a respected authority on the subject at the brussels-based economic think-tank bruegel . while the british and american free-market model has the advantage of flexibility it leaves too many citizens behind , in sapir 's view . " the anglo-saxons have an efficient but unfair social model while the continentals enjoy much more equity but weaker efficiency " , sapir said . lack of response could be fatal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly efficient work practices in china could leave the eu behind however , inefficiency was a crippling handicap in the global race to get ahead , sapir said . " the models that are inefficient are simply not sustainable in the face of the growing tensions on public finances coming from globalization , technological change and population aging , " he said . bank of american economist lorenzo codogno warned against imitating various models and recommended adapting each country 's system to the challenges of globalization . " the us model way is not to be followed blindly but also the scandinavian way is not " to be simply imitated , he said . " the reform process needs to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual country while maintaining an eu-wide coordination , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to grapple with globalization at summit european union leaders gather thursday in the splendor of a 16th-century english palace for a free-wheeling debate on how to spur growth and create jobs in a 21st century defined by globalization .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "
although eu leaders widely agree that the right model for europe is a " social market economy " , interpretations of what that means vary widely . " the nordics are in an enviable position with a social model bearing both efficiency and equity while the mediterraneans live in a model that bears neither , " said andre sapir a respected authority on the subject at the brussels-based economic think-tank bruegel . while the british and american free-market model has the advantage of flexibility it leaves too many citizens behind , in sapir 's view . " the anglo-saxons have an efficient but unfair social model while the continentals enjoy much more equity but weaker efficiency " , sapir said . lack of response could be fatal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly efficient work practices in china could leave the eu behind however , inefficiency was a crippling handicap in the global race to get ahead , sapir said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 end-of-life care neglected in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a minority of the terminally ill are cared for in hospices a raging debate about assisted suicide in germany has drawn attention to the generally poor care that the terminally ill receive . last week , health minister ulla schmidt pledged 250 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to improve and expand hospices and palliative care in the germany .
the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin .

the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

" the models that are inefficient are simply not sustainable in the face of the growing tensions on public finances coming from globalization , technological change and population aging , " he said . bank of american economist lorenzo codogno warned against imitating various models and recommended adapting each country 's system to the challenges of globalization . " the us model way is not to be followed blindly but also the scandinavian way is not " to be simply imitated , he said .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 end-of-life care neglected in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a minority of the terminally ill are cared for in hospices a raging debate about assisted suicide in germany has drawn attention to the generally poor care that the terminally ill receive . last week , health minister ulla schmidt pledged 250 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to improve and expand hospices and palliative care in the germany .
the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 end-of-life care neglected in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a minority of the terminally ill are cared for in hospices a raging debate about assisted suicide in germany has drawn attention to the generally poor care that the terminally ill receive . last week , health minister ulla schmidt pledged 250 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to improve and expand hospices and palliative care in the germany .
the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .

but glamour is the last thing you 'll find in one such light-filled dwelling overlooking a jumble of spires and red-brick buildings in berlin 's neukölln neighborhood .
instead , the 15 rooms leading off from a carpeted corridor are home to a constantly changing flow of terminally ill patients who take the elevator up to the fifth floor of the inconspicuous building to die .
" of course most people would like to die at home as far as possible .
but here in our hospice we try to do everything we can to make those final moments worth living for every patient , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice .
together with a team of some 90 doctors , palliative care experts , nursing personnel , psychological counselors , cooks , social and voluntary workers , schlachter tries to ensure that patients , who mostly arrive in terminal stages of cancer and neurological disorders like altzheimer 's , manage to live a pain-free existence and are cared for compassionately until they pass away .

there 's also a meditation room where patients and even hospice staff can withdraw to spend time alone or have a good cry when they feel overwhelmed by the situation .
and a huge terrace is used for barbecues in summer and a winter garden for celebrating christmas and birthdays .

" our emergency aid has been completely exhausted .
i have applied to the federal minister of finance for an extension of five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- . "
germany has promised a total of 20 million euros and has so far contributed 20 percent of the eu ’ s 13.6 million euros of aid . wieczorek-zeul also called on the german public to give more in donations for the earthquake victims .
" it may not be that those people who survived have to die as a result of the disaster . "
huge donations from the german public to the tsunami stricken areas in south asia at the start of the year helped to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and saved survivors of the actual event from becoming victims of its aftermath . un conference leads to increased international aid meanwhile , the international community raised its initial pledge of aid to $ 580 million after the united nations donors ' conference in geneva on wednesday .
the increased aid came after un secretary general kofi annan made a dramatic appeal for more support .
it was the international community 's responsibility , he told the representatives of 65 countries gathered in the swiss city , to prevent " the second shockwave of dead people . " between two and three million survivors are in increasing danger after the massive earthquake and subsequent aftershocks two and half weeks ago , which destroyed villages and towns in the seismic zone , as the harsh kashmiri winter begins to set in .

but what would you make of a masseuse approaching you in a bar and offering to give some instant stress relief ? while the practice may be common in certain types of bars in thailand , this kind of thing does not happen very often in europe , at least in reputable places .
but instances are on the rise especially in germany .
pub massages are becoming increasingly popular all across the country . the neck attack company started off in germany in stuttgart in 2004 after the australian fad of pub massage made its way over to europe in the tales of incredulous european backpackers .
the founders of neck attack have since expanded their staff from just two to more than 60 as the business has grown and spread nationwide . no fixed price for ten minutes of relaxation the trained masseuses and physiotherapists offer a range of thai , shiatsu and ayurveda massage and depending on how much they enjoyed it , how much they have left after ordering drinks or how much alcohol they have consumed , punters pay a little or a lot for a rub .
there is no fixed price for the massages which tend to last between five and ten minutes .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "
although eu leaders widely agree that the right model for europe is a " social market economy " , interpretations of what that means vary widely . " the nordics are in an enviable position with a social model bearing both efficiency and equity while the mediterraneans live in a model that bears neither , " said andre sapir a respected authority on the subject at the brussels-based economic think-tank bruegel . while the british and american free-market model has the advantage of flexibility it leaves too many citizens behind , in sapir 's view . " the anglo-saxons have an efficient but unfair social model while the continentals enjoy much more equity but weaker efficiency " , sapir said . lack of response could be fatal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly efficient work practices in china could leave the eu behind however , inefficiency was a crippling handicap in the global race to get ahead , sapir said . " the models that are inefficient are simply not sustainable in the face of the growing tensions on public finances coming from globalization , technological change and population aging , " he said . bank of american economist lorenzo codogno warned against imitating various models and recommended adapting each country 's system to the challenges of globalization . " the us model way is not to be followed blindly but also the scandinavian way is not " to be simply imitated , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 final compensation pending for former nazi forced laborers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers came from many countries to be slaves for germany some 60 years after the horrors of slavery under the third reich , 1.6 million former forced laborers have received compensation .
while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter germans too quiet about suicide choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 end-of-life care neglected in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a minority of the terminally ill are cared for in hospices a raging debate about assisted suicide in germany has drawn attention to the generally poor care that the terminally ill receive . last week , health minister ulla schmidt pledged 250 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- to improve and expand hospices and palliative care in the germany .
the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin . " and sometimes it 's just too late by then .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 final compensation pending for former nazi forced laborers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers came from many countries to be slaves for germany some 60 years after the horrors of slavery under the third reich , 1.6 million former forced laborers have received compensation .
while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .
the memorial will commemorate the hundreds of thousands of people who worked against their will during world war ii .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .

the ongoing war in the breakaway republic of chechnya , she added , remained an added irritation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnyans protest against putin in berlin " people are still disappearing at an alarming rate , perhaps the highest rate in the world , " she said .
" we feel that the russian government should be investigating and prosecuting the troops that are responsible for such atrocities and we would hope that the german government would press to take these steps . " bogert 's demands vis-à-vis berlin are anything but new .
but there 's a feeling that a new coalition government under chancellor-designate angela merkel might lead to a real readjustment of this country 's foreign policy guidelines towards the kremlin . " i think that the recent intensity and nature of german-russian relations has been heavily dependent on the friendly relations between outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin , " said marianne heuwagen , who heads the new human rights watch office in berlin .
" angela merkel will of course not completely change bilateral relations between berlin and moscow .
but if her eastern background is anything to go by , she 'll be more likely not to bring up the chechnya issue . " co n cer n s about chi n a carroll bogert said she is also hoping that the german government will be more courageous in addressing human rights issues having regarding china .
the outgoing schröder government had been in the firing line for dodging human rights violations in china so as not to jeopardize lucrative business contracts with beijing . " i think the critical issue is one of rejecting the position that business is business and that business with china must be done and that nothing can get in its way , " she said , adding that china 's restrictive internet policy was something western business leaders should be concerned about as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese internet users are not free to surf the web as the please " it 's obvious that much of the business that western companies , german companies included , want to do in china , is going to rely on - among other things - freedom of expression and the ability to use the internet , " she said . unlike the acting german government , human rights watch is strongly in favor of upholding the arms embargo against china as imposed by the european union after the massacre in tiananmen square in 1989 .
it says the embargo should stay in place unless the chinese government paves the way for genuine investigations into the massacre and brings to justice those responsible for the bloodshed . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder defends pipeline project outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder has defended joint german-russian plans to build an underwater gas pipeline in the face of criticism from lithuania .

" of course most people would like to die at home as far as possible .
but here in our hospice we try to do everything we can to make those final moments worth living for every patient , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice .

" from left to right , there 's no political movement in poland that accepts the center , " said dieter bingen , who directs the german poland institute in darmstadt . bdv to blame for polish sta n d ? he added that talking about the expulsion of people from the former eastern parts of the german reich was not taboo in poland , but " such a center , set up under the leadership of the bdv , can not be sold to the polish public . " bingen said that the bdv not only rejected the german-polish border treaty that recognized the two country 's terrorities in 1990 but also called on the german government to talk about the expulsions during poland 's eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach expects the new government to back the project the bdv 's president , erika steinbach , meanwhile said that the poles intentionally ignored her organization 's true intentions . " otherwise the majority , including decision-makers , would realize that the center would be the only place that would document that fate of expelled poles , " she said , adding that in addition to documenting the former settlement areas and the flight of about 12 million expelled germans , the center would include a section on the expulsions of 30 ethnic groups , including poles . a germa n decisio n ? steinbach , a member of parliament for the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also said that the topic of expulsion was part of germany 's identity . " we do n't tell the french or the british or the poles how they are supposed to deal with their history , " she said .
" one can expect neighbors to be treated the same . " pointing to the cdu 's election program , she added that she expected germany 's next government to support the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center would focus not only focus on the expulsion of germans " in the spirit of reconciliation , we want to make a statement with a center against expulsions in berlin in order to remind of the injustice of expulsion and outlaw future expulsions at the same time , " the program read . but it 's questionable whether the federal government will financially support the center in the future . the social democrats , the likely junior partner in the next government , does n't even want to express verbal backing for the project .

" our emergency aid has been completely exhausted .

germany has promised a total of 20 million euros and has so far contributed 20 percent of the eu ’ s 13.6 million euros of aid . wieczorek-zeul also called on the german public to give more in donations for the earthquake victims .
" it may not be that those people who survived have to die as a result of the disaster . "
huge donations from the german public to the tsunami stricken areas in south asia at the start of the year helped to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and saved survivors of the actual event from becoming victims of its aftermath . un conference leads to increased international aid meanwhile , the international community raised its initial pledge of aid to $ 580 million after the united nations donors ' conference in geneva on wednesday .
the increased aid came after un secretary general kofi annan made a dramatic appeal for more support .

" between two and three million survivors are in increasing danger after the massive earthquake and subsequent aftershocks two and half weeks ago , which destroyed villages and towns in the seismic zone , as the harsh kashmiri winter begins to set in .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform .

" the hampton court meeting is the chance for europe to show leadership and kick-start the european economy back onto a path of reform , modernization and growth , " brown said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal europe . while the united states and japan are enjoying an economic resurgence , much of europe is still struggling to stimulate growth , with latest figures putting gdp expansion in the euro zone at a paltry 1.2 percent . blair : europe faces " grand strategic failure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair is using the summit to reissue his rallying call to the eu prime minister tony blair has made reform the battle cry of britain 's six-month eu presidency , warning that europe faces " grand strategic failure " if it shies away from the challenge . the hampton court summit gives blair a fresh chance to renew his call to arms , although bragging about britain 's superior growth and flexibility could reignite latent tensions with countries like france and germany , more reluctant to pursue sweeping reforms . giving a preview of his thinking , blair said wednesday : " i think that it is agreed generally in europe that we need to get europe moving and we need to get it moving in the right direction .
the question is how we do that , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg . much of the debate - which was taking place behind closed doors in order to preserve the informal nature of the brain-storming session - is to be focused on which economic model can ensure european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ’ security amid growing competition from asian countries . europe needs to update its social model , says barroso bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso warned of the eu being overtaken by globalization weighing into the debate , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned that the european social model needed an update if it was to survive in the fiercely competitive world of globalization . he told german newspaper suddeutsche zeitung that " if you want to keep a social market economy you have to undertake reform . "
although eu leaders widely agree that the right model for europe is a " social market economy " , interpretations of what that means vary widely . " the nordics are in an enviable position with a social model bearing both efficiency and equity while the mediterraneans live in a model that bears neither , " said andre sapir a respected authority on the subject at the brussels-based economic think-tank bruegel . while the british and american free-market model has the advantage of flexibility it leaves too many citizens behind , in sapir 's view . " the anglo-saxons have an efficient but unfair social model while the continentals enjoy much more equity but weaker efficiency " , sapir said . lack of response could be fatal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly efficient work practices in china could leave the eu behind however , inefficiency was a crippling handicap in the global race to get ahead , sapir said . " the models that are inefficient are simply not sustainable in the face of the growing tensions on public finances coming from globalization , technological change and population aging , " he said . bank of american economist lorenzo codogno warned against imitating various models and recommended adapting each country 's system to the challenges of globalization . " the us model way is not to be followed blindly but also the scandinavian way is not " to be simply imitated , he said . " the reform process needs to be tailored to the specific needs of each individual country while maintaining an eu-wide coordination , " he added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to grapple with globalization at summit european union leaders gather thursday in the splendor of a 16th-century english palace for a free-wheeling debate on how to spur growth and create jobs in a 21st century defined by globalization .

germany has promised a total of 20 million euros and has so far contributed 20 percent of the eu ’ s 13.6 million euros of aid . wieczorek-zeul also called on the german public to give more in donations for the earthquake victims .
" it may not be that those people who survived have to die as a result of the disaster . "
huge donations from the german public to the tsunami stricken areas in south asia at the start of the year helped to prevent the outbreak of epidemics and saved survivors of the actual event from becoming victims of its aftermath . un conference leads to increased international aid meanwhile , the international community raised its initial pledge of aid to $ 580 million after the united nations donors ' conference in geneva on wednesday .
the increased aid came after un secretary general kofi annan made a dramatic appeal for more support .

" between two and three million survivors are in increasing danger after the massive earthquake and subsequent aftershocks two and half weeks ago , which destroyed villages and towns in the seismic zone , as the harsh kashmiri winter begins to set in .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .

many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .

while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .

the founders of neck attack have since expanded their staff from just two to more than 60 as the business has grown and spread nationwide . no fixed price for ten minutes of relaxation the trained masseuses and physiotherapists offer a range of thai , shiatsu and ayurveda massage and depending on how much they enjoyed it , how much they have left after ordering drinks or how much alcohol they have consumed , punters pay a little or a lot for a rub .
there is no fixed price for the massages which tend to last between five and ten minutes .
" once you 've encouraged them to try it , they really enjoy it and say how good it was afterwards , " chris walther , a masseur with neck attack who works the pubs in cologne , told reuters . " i think it 's a great idea because most people who come here tend to have had a really stressful day at work , ” said sven sastine a recipient on a massage at his local bar .

but glamour is the last thing you 'll find in one such light-filled dwelling overlooking a jumble of spires and red-brick buildings in berlin 's neukölln neighborhood .
instead , the 15 rooms leading off from a carpeted corridor are home to a constantly changing flow of terminally ill patients who take the elevator up to the fifth floor of the inconspicuous building to die .
" of course most people would like to die at home as far as possible .
but here in our hospice we try to do everything we can to make those final moments worth living for every patient , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice .
together with a team of some 90 doctors , palliative care experts , nursing personnel , psychological counselors , cooks , social and voluntary workers , schlachter tries to ensure that patients , who mostly arrive in terminal stages of cancer and neurological disorders like altzheimer 's , manage to live a pain-free existence and are cared for compassionately until they pass away .

creating a sense of home the focus in the hospice is on creating a sense of normality given the circumstances .
family members can visit their loved ones at any time and stay for as long as they want , even overnight in guest rooms .
the centerpiece of the hospice is the kitchen , where a handful of patients gather around the table in their wheelchairs for lunch and company .
there 's also a meditation room where patients and even hospice staff can withdraw to spend time alone or have a good cry when they feel overwhelmed by the situation .
and a huge terrace is used for barbecues in summer and a winter garden for celebrating christmas and birthdays .

" i remember we had a young mother who was in the terminal stages of abdominal cancer and in excruciating pain .
but we still took her during her final days to a soccer game she wanted to watch because her eight-year-old son was playing , " said schlachter .
" we hooked a small portable device under her skin which transmitted the painkillers . "
" we want the patients to live a normal life as far as possible and celebrate events and laugh , " said schlachter .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone .

for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone .

the latter is loosely defined as a holistic attempt to treat persons suffering from incurable illnesses in such a manner as to relieve their pain as far as possible and provide emotional and spiritual care to improve the quality of their lives so that they can die in dignity .
schmidt has also promised to set up 330 teams of trained palliative care experts across the country . many in the health services have welcomed the move . " death and dying are still touchy subjects in our society and politicians have only paid lip service until now .
but we 're glad that they 're finally giving in to our long-standing demands for more funds , " said thomas schindler , head of the bonn-based german society for palliative medicine .
" though palliative medicine has made progress in germany , we still have a lot of catching up to do compared to other countries . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands allows euthanasia , but there too it has been controversial josef winkler , a green party parliamentarian and member of the commission on ethics and law in medicine , a body comprising members of parliament and experts that advises the government , agreed .
compared to countries like the netherlands - which is often slammed by german anti-euthanasia groups for legalizing the practice - germany comes off " extremely badly " when it comes to palliative care and taking care of its dying , winkler said .
he added that the country urgently needed a nationwide palliative care system for the terminally ill .
hospices beyond the reach of majority the majority of terminally ill patients die in hospitals and nursing homes , often lonely and in pain .
it 's estimated that of the 850,000 people dying in germany each year , only about 2 percent receive end-of-life professional care and just about 1,150 hospice beds are available for them throughout the country .
the issue of caring for the dying has gained attention in recent weeks ever since dignitas , a swiss-based organization for assisted suicide , opened a german chapter in hanover .
the group says that more than half of the 453 people they helped to their deaths since 1998 have been germans who traveled to switzerland for release from their suffering . but what can be done to ease the suffering ?
for starters , experts in the field agree that one of the most pressing problems is insufficient financing of professional end-of-life care at home , which involves a network of voluntary workers and nursing care personnel who are in intensive contact not just with the dying patient at home but also with the family members . " more money is needed there because the work is so time-consuming and painstaking , " said schindler .
" and we need to invest more in training programs , because many doctors only care for the dying on the fringes and are unsure of the right way to go about it . "
training doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future doctors in germany may well have palliative medicine as a subject investing in further training and education programs in palliative care as well as research is also a key demand that the medical ethics commission included in its recent report on the state of palliative care and hospices in germany .
it went a step further by adding that palliative medicine should be a mandatory subject on the curriculum for all prospective doctors .
" it ca n't be that in a highly-developed country like germany , doctors are unable to help dying patients because they are n't qualified to do so , " said winkler .
" there 's an extremely low number of cases where doctors really ca n't help a patient anymore , and with the current advances in medicine and palliative care , dying patients do have a chance to live pain-free , " he said .
but given the debate on assisted suicide , the immediate goal is to drastically increase the number of well-organized hospices in the country .
" most people are n't scared of dying , " winkler pointed out .
" they 're just scared of dying alone . " " we sometimes have patients who are on our hospice waiting list for as long as three to four weeks , " said johannes schlachter , head of nursing care at the ricam hospice in berlin . " and sometimes it 's just too late by then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.10.2005 final compensation pending for former nazi forced laborers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers came from many countries to be slaves for germany some 60 years after the horrors of slavery under the third reich , 1.6 million former forced laborers have received compensation .
while the struggle for payment has now come to an end , the grief and suffering lingers . during world war ii , about 12 million people were kidnapped from their homes across europe and beyond and forced to work for the nazi regime in germany .
the slaves were not only put to work in camps , the most infamous of applications of forced labor , but in all areas of german industry . " employment of foreign forced laborers was not only limited to large-scale enterprises , " said history professor ulrich herbert of the university of freiburg .
" it was applied throughout the whole economy ; from the small farm and locksmith 's shop with just six workers , to the national railway system , the local authority districts , the big armament companies and also many private households . " it took 55 years until compensation became an issue .
gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition government , in cooperation with german industry , set up the " recollection , responsibility and future " foundation in 2000 , which had the task of raising a total of 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to cover all the claims .
since it was set up , more than 6,500 enterprises have contributed to the fund . at first , the 2.5 billion euros to which german industry had committed itself began to accumulate slowly , even though the money itself , as a donation , was tax deductible , and companies that participated received protection from further legal action concerning their use of slave labor during the war . companies refused to accept responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forced laborers worked in all areas of german industry .
many enterprises had refused for years to help the former forced laborers .
though the nazi regime lost the war , german companies continued to profit from forced labor . german industrial wealth was 17 times larger after the war than in 1939 .
for decades , the companies ' executive boards avoided paying victims compensation by saying they were compelled to use slave labor . despite the difficulties in raising the money and getting companies to accept responsibility , the final payments are due to be paid during the autumn of 2005 .
the former forced laborers are each eligible for around 7,700 euros .
the heirs of those who have passed away can claim their relatives ' shares .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern europe and the soviet union provided much of the work force " although the payment is in one sense largely symbolic , it has made a difference for many elderly and in some cases very needy people , " said brunson mckinley , director-general of the international organization for migration . unclaimed funds are due to be channeled into social projects .
" this money will be made available to partner organizations for social purposes , for old people 's homes , medical services , for providing wheelchairs , hearing aids , etc , " said foundation chairman hans-otto brautigam . final payment must not be the end , says fund chief he said the compensation payments are recognition by both the german government and its people of the immense suffering and injustice inflicted on the victims of the nazi regime . he acknowledged that this recognition is long overdue , but hoped it is not too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are the best evidence of what happened to forced laborers " in a political and in a moral sense , this chapter will never be closed , " he said .
" what is at stake here - and this is the responsibility of our generation and future generations - is to keep these very tragic events , these human rights violations firmly in the national memory . " brautigam stressed that future generations must know their history and understand why such things happened .
he said he believes the german people have a responsibility to see to it that the sort of atrocities perpetrated by the nazis under adolf hitler are never repeated . michael marek -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to honor nazi-era forced laborers berlin will open germany 's first tribute to victims of the nazi regime 's forced labor program in 2006 .

the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- has issued a subpoena , and the firm said it was co-operating fully .
regulators are looking into areas including how gm accounts for pension liabilities and transactions between itself and bankrupt supplier delphi .
gm said subpoenas were also served on firms related to its finance division , general motors acceptance corp -lrb- gmac -rrb- .
not alone the sec already is investigating other firms , including another carmaker , and is trying to improve its understanding of how companies book pension liabilities .
analysts said the concern is that firms may inflate or cut their liabilities in order to boot profits or cut losses .
on top of that is the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by delphi , which has muddied the waters regarding the amount of money gm needs to stump up to cover retirement costs .
delphi was spun off from gm in 1999 , and the carmaker underwrote pension costs for many of the firms ' workers .
since delphi has asked for protection from its creditors , gm has said that it may be liable for as much as $ 12bn -lrb- £ 6.7bn -rrb- in pension costs for the auto parts firm 's workers .
gm already is creaking under its own pension requirements and has lost almost $ 4bn in the first nine months of this year .

ship 's stoker william mcquillan was believed to have been lost at sea when the titanic sank on 15 april 1912 .
but a film about bbc northern ireland 's mike mckimm 's dive to the ship led his family to locate his grave .
mr mcquillan did drown in the disaster , but his body was found and brought ashore at halifax in nova scotia .
ninety-three years ago , back in the ship 's home city of belfast , his grieving family could only believe what they saw in the papers .
the belfast telegraph of 4 may 1912 revealed mr mcquillan was not one of the survivors and that the bodies of the missing belfast firemen who stoked the titanic 's engines " lay in a sailor 's grave , two miles beneath the ocean " .
the next morning , i went down to mum and she was amazed too because all she and the relatives knew was he had been lost at sea marjorie wilson in a cruel twist of fate , just two days later , william mcquillan 's body was buried in grave 183 in fairview cemetery , halifax , canada .

marjorie wilson is william mcquillan 's granddaughter .
her husband victor was watching bbc newsline 's journey to remember documentary about the dive to titanic in august .

a photograph of william mcquillan is in the family 's possession " so it was great , in a way , to find out . "
william 's children all went to their graves assuming that he was one of the missing .
as marjorie sat staring at the photograph of his gravestone , she related how she first discovered her grandfather died in the tragedy .
" i was 12-years-old and a friend and i were up in the town -lrb- belfast -rrb- and there was a drinking fountain at the city hall .

marjorie said her grandfather should not have been on the titanic .
but a friend due to sail on the ship wanted to remain on shore to take care of his wife who was expecting their first child , so william volunteered to take his place - a generous gesture that cost him his life .
his house at 79 seaview street in north belfast has long since gone .

by jorn madslien bbc news business reporter the prince of wales deems climate change the " greatest challenge to face man " , and according to a warning this week global warming is making the world 's poor even worse off .
but can it also help to create fresh wealth ?
climate change - whether manmade or natural - is seen by some as a boon to business in the arctic region , where adventurous capitalists are desperate to obtain access to resources that are uncovered as the ice retreats .
" for decades , this was a frozen region , literally and politically , " says norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere - referring both to the cold war and to the thawing of the polar ice in the barents sea .
" in the years to come , it may be from this high north that both continental europe and the united states will be looking for additional supplies of oil and gas . "
currently , europe and the us make up for more than half the world 's gas and oil consumption , but demand from other countries is rising .
" energy demand is -lsb- also -rsb- expected to grow very fast in china and india , " adds norwegian petroleum and energy minister odd roger enoksen , in an interview with the bbc news website .
the search is on the arctic 's commercial potential has sent most leading energy companies scurrying into harsh and remote areas in north america , russia 's siberia and the barents sea - all parts of a region that is believed to contain as much as a quarter of the world 's undiscovered reserves of oil and gas .
" obviously , we are doing a lot in alaska , and depending on how you define the arctic , we are doing a lot in russia , " lord browne , chief executive of bp , tells the bbc news website .
last week , the us senate energy committee voted to open for oil drilling in alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge - despite fierce protests by environmentalists .
in the barents sea , meanwhile , the next goal is to develop oil fields , in addition to existing gas fields - again , in spite of protests by both environmentalists and the region 's important fisheries industry .
" there have already been discoveries both on the norwegian and the russian side , " helge lund , chief executive of the norwegian energy giant statoil , tells the bbc news website .
harsh environment but the warmer climate is proving to be a mixed blessing , even for businesses that stand to gain .
climate change has done little to improve the arctic region 's harsh climate .
winter storms , coming at a time of the year when ship and rig crews operate in virtually perpetual darkness , are set to become even more prevalent than before .
" these regions are categorised by extreme weather conditions and sea water temperatures below freezing points , " observes mr lund .
indeed , although the warmer weather may be doing much to open up new shipping routes and bluewater ports , it has also led to an increase - not a decrease - in the frequency of icebergs .
" the icebergs can rip up pipelines and production facilities and everything else that gets in their way , " says rasmus sunde , executive vice president of vetco , a supplier to the oil industry .
drilling for oil in an area where million-tonne icebergs are drifting at speeds of up to 900 metres an hour , only to be overtaken by large sheets of ice sometimes drifting four times as fast , is a serious challenge .
floating drilling platforms , or drilling barges , of the kind used in the north sea and elsewhere in the world , can not be used under such conditions , so fixed installations are required , mr sunde tells the bbc news website .
conditions are no easier in siberia and alaska , where any thawing of the permafrost makes it more difficult to transport heavy kit over the tundra , and where temperature swings that cause the ice to move threaten to destabilise oil and gas pipelines .
expensive operations all this is pushing up costs .
arctic crews are scarce , skilled and expensive , ice breakers or ice secured tankers even more so . "
high oil and gas prices are necessary to secure a non-opec increase in supply " norwegian energy minister odd roger enoksen ship builders - keen to cash in on the boom by making ice strengthened oil and gas tankers , freight ships or ice breakers - say such vessels can cost several million dollars more than conventional bluewater ships .
and as arctic miners , fishermen and ship operators have always known , there is inevitably a lot of inactivity for kit and crew , with plenty of waiting time due to the unpredictable nature of the work and the weather .
insurance costs are also much higher for arctic operators , not least because of the potential size of liability claims they could face if things go wrong , for example in the case of a production or transportation accident that turns into an environmental tragedy .
energy security given that " oil and gas exploitation will become more demanding in the future " , the industry will need massive capital injections in the next 30 years to meet an anticipated 60 % rise in demand by 2030 , says mr lund .
" all the easy barrels are already produced , " he says .
" significant investment is necessary . "
a whopping annual $ 560bn -lrb- £ 314bn -rrb- cash injection will be required in the years ahead , estimates lord browne .
and it is likely that the investment is forthcoming - in part from commercial operators eyeing great returns , but also from governments keen to curb the dominance of the opec cartel of oil producing nations .
the george w bush administration 's plan to extract billions of barrels of crude oil in alaska is a clear indication of a growing desire by the west to reduce its dependence on the energy reserves in the middle east .
in addition , gas from russian and norwegian fields in the barents sea will also soon be shipped to the us in giant lng tankers .
in europe , a new gas pipeline through the baltic sea will bring russian gas to germany , while the uk is set to receive up to a fifth of its gas through a soon-to-be-opened giant pipeline from a norwegian field .
the search , which focuses on ever " smaller and more difficult pockets " of oil and gas , should secure supplies for decades , believes tom botts , vice president in charge of shell 's european exploration and production operations .
but it is also likely to mean consumers will have to pay dearly for energy in the future .
" high oil and gas prices are necessary to secure a non-opec increase in supply , " observes mr enoksen .

" in the years to come , it may be from this high north that both continental europe and the united states will be looking for additional supplies of oil and gas . "
currently , europe and the us make up for more than half the world 's gas and oil consumption , but demand from other countries is rising .
" energy demand is -lsb- also -rsb- expected to grow very fast in china and india , " adds norwegian petroleum and energy minister odd roger enoksen , in an interview with the bbc news website .
the search is on the arctic 's commercial potential has sent most leading energy companies scurrying into harsh and remote areas in north america , russia 's siberia and the barents sea - all parts of a region that is believed to contain as much as a quarter of the world 's undiscovered reserves of oil and gas .
bp chief lord browne believes vast investment is key " obviously , we are doing a lot in alaska , and depending on how you define the arctic , we are doing a lot in russia , " lord browne , chief executive of bp , tells the bbc news website .
last week , the us senate energy committee voted to open for oil drilling in alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge - despite fierce protests by environmentalists .
in the barents sea , meanwhile , the next goal is to develop oil fields , in addition to existing gas fields - again , in spite of protests by both environmentalists and the region 's important fisheries industry .
" there have already been discoveries both on the norwegian and the russian side , " helge lund , chief executive of the norwegian energy giant statoil , tells the bbc news website .
harsh environment but the warmer climate is proving to be a mixed blessing , even for businesses that stand to gain .
environmentalists worry about the push into the arctic region climate change has done little to improve the arctic region 's harsh climate .
winter storms , coming at a time of the year when ship and rig crews operate in virtually perpetual darkness , are set to become even more prevalent than before .
" these regions are categorised by extreme weather conditions and sea water temperatures below freezing points , " observes mr lund .
indeed , although the warmer weather may be doing much to open up new shipping routes and bluewater ports , it has also led to an increase - not a decrease - in the frequency of icebergs .
" the icebergs can rip up pipelines and production facilities and everything else that gets in their way , " says rasmus sunde , executive vice president of vetco , a supplier to the oil industry .
drilling for oil in an area where million-tonne icebergs are drifting at speeds of up to 900 metres an hour , only to be overtaken by large sheets of ice sometimes drifting four times as fast , is a serious challenge .
floating drilling platforms , or drilling barges , of the kind used in the north sea and elsewhere in the world , can not be used under such conditions , so fixed installations are required , mr sunde tells the bbc news website .
conditions are no easier in siberia and alaska , where any thawing of the permafrost makes it more difficult to transport heavy kit over the tundra , and where temperature swings that cause the ice to move threaten to destabilise oil and gas pipelines .
expensive operations all this is pushing up costs .
arctic crews are scarce , skilled and expensive , ice breakers or ice secured tankers even more so .
high oil and gas prices are necessary to secure a non-opec increase in supply norwegian energy minister odd roger enoksen ship builders - keen to cash in on the boom by making ice strengthened oil and gas tankers , freight ships or ice breakers - say such vessels can cost several million dollars more than conventional bluewater ships .
and as arctic miners , fishermen and ship operators have always known , there is inevitably a lot of inactivity for kit and crew , with plenty of waiting time due to the unpredictable nature of the work and the weather .
insurance costs are also much higher for arctic operators , not least because of the potential size of liability claims they could face if things go wrong , for example in the case of a production or transportation accident that turns into an environmental tragedy .
energy security given that " oil and gas exploitation will become more demanding in the future " , the industry will need massive capital injections in the next 30 years to meet an anticipated 60 % rise in demand by 2030 , says mr lund .
" all the easy barrels are already produced , " he says .
" significant investment is necessary . "
a whopping annual $ 560bn -lrb- £ 314bn -rrb- cash injection will be required in the years ahead , estimates lord browne .
gas from the barents sea is set to reduce us reliance on opec and it is likely that the investment is forthcoming - in part from commercial operators eyeing great returns , but also from governments keen to curb the dominance of the opec cartel of oil producing nations .
the george w bush administration 's plan to extract billions of barrels of crude oil in alaska is a clear indication of a growing desire by the west to reduce its dependence on the energy reserves in the middle east .
in addition , gas from russian and norwegian fields in the barents sea will also soon be shipped to the us in giant lng tankers .
in europe , a new gas pipeline through the baltic sea will bring russian gas to germany , while the uk is set to receive up to a fifth of its gas through a soon-to-be-opened giant pipeline from a norwegian field .
the search , which focuses on ever " smaller and more difficult pockets " of oil and gas , should secure supplies for decades , believes tom botts , vice president in charge of shell 's european exploration and production operations .
but it is also likely to mean consumers will have to pay dearly for energy in the future .
" high oil and gas prices are necessary to secure a non-opec increase in supply , " observes mr enoksen .

friends of the earth scotland said £ 180m had been allocated for the compulsory purchase of property .
it also said the cost of creating a job through the project was £ 100,000 , compared to £ 2,000 per job spent by scottish enterprise last year .
but the scottish executive accused the campaigners of being too simplistic .
foe scotland divided the project 's overall budget of up to £ 500m by the number of jobs that could be created and said it came to £ 100,000 per job .
it is very bad value for money duncan mclaren foe scotland chief executive duncan mclaren said its estimate was based on figures given to the public inquiry into the project .
" that concluded that at best the scheme would generate 5,000 additional jobs for scotland as a whole , " he said .
he described the executive 's suggestion that 20,000 jobs would be created as " exaggerated and simplistic " and said this had been rejected by the public inquiry .
" it is very bad value for money , " he said .
economic benefits ministers gave the scheme the go-ahead after overruling the recommendation of the public inquiry .
the executive said campaigners were overlooking the wider economic benefits of the scheme , such as easing congestion and improving the competitiveness of the west of scotland , and said it could actually create 20,000 jobs .
the campaigners also said the extension would put about 3,000 jobs at risk , through the displacement or closure of businesses .
but the executive claimed most jobs would be protected .

mr farron claims the average income for the area is £ 16,000 a year , but average house prices are about £ 200,000 .
in an adjournment debate on thursday , mr farron is calling on the government to introduce a cap on second home ownership in the lake district .
he said : " this is an unsustainable position for south lakeland .
" we are losing over a quarter of our young people who do not return and it has come to the point where we have to ask the government to take action and intervene .
controversial plans " one in six homes in the area is a second home and that is a very difficult position to sustain , when that means many communities are under stocked in terms of a young population .
" what i am asking for today is for a cap to be put on second home ownership throughout the country , but especially in areas like the lake district . "
mr fallon said he also wanted the government to drop controversial plans to let people buy second homes as part of their savings for retirement .
currently there are more than 3,500 second homes in south lakeland alone .
earlier this year a report by britain 's biggest mortgage lender , the halifax , revealed first-time buyers were being priced out of the rural market by second-home owners .
it found house prices in rural areas had risen faster than towns and cities in the past 10 years .

the 52 kg micro-satellite , sseti express , was designed and built by 100 students from 10 universities in nine countries .
it blasted off aboard a russian cosmos 3m rocket in the first launch from the cosmodrome since the loss of europe 's ice mission , cryosat .
sseti express shared a ride with satellites for china , iran and the uk .
graham shirville , who masterminded the telecommunications side of the project , said it was essentially a demonstration payload .
" it 's the first european-built satellite that has been built largely by using the internet as communication between the teams , " he said .
" the prime purpose is to demonstrate that students , with assistance from an organisation like the european space agency , can design and build a satellite well-enough constructed to be flown with other passengers . "
moonlander project the satellite is the first mission of the student space exploration and technology initiative -lrb- sseti -rrb- .
in conjunction with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , which funds the project , the students hope to construct and launch several micro-satellites and potentially more complex projects such as a moonlander .
sseti express carries a camera to take images of the earth and three tiny " cubesats " to carry out experiments .
it will also act as a transponder to relay amateur radio signals .
" the main objective of this mission is not what happens in space , it is the educational objective - to enhance the literacy and motivation of european students for space engineering and space science , " project manager neil melville of esa 's education department told the bbc news website .
other passengers sseti express shares a ride into space with china 's beijing-1 microsatellite built in the uk by surrey satellite technology .
beijing-1 carries the china mapping telescope , a very powerful high-resolution instrument build by uk scientists at sira , instrumentation and measurement experts , to map and photograph chinese territory .
it will help plan projects associated with the 2008 beijing olympics and monitor and manage natural as well as man-made disasters .

the 52 kg micro-satellite , sseti express , was designed and built by 100 students from 10 universities in nine countries .
it blasted off aboard a russian cosmos 3m rocket in the first launch from the cosmodrome since the loss of europe 's ice mission , cryosat .
sseti express shared a ride with satellites for china , iran and the uk .
graham shirville , who masterminded the telecommunications side of the project , said it was essentially a demonstration payload .
" it 's the first european-built satellite that has been built largely by using the internet as communication between the teams , " he said .
" the prime purpose is to demonstrate that students , with assistance from an organisation like the european space agency , can design and build a satellite well-enough constructed to be flown with other passengers . "
moonlander project the satellite is the first mission of the student space exploration and technology initiative -lrb- sseti -rrb- .
in conjunction with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , which funds the project , the students hope to construct and launch several micro-satellites and potentially more complex projects such as a moonlander .
sseti is one of several satellites being launched -lrb- image : esa -rrb- sseti express carries a camera to take images of the earth and three tiny " cubesats " to carry out experiments .
it will also act as a transponder to relay amateur radio signals .
" the main objective of this mission is not what happens in space , it is the educational objective - to enhance the literacy and motivation of european students for space engineering and space science , " project manager neil melville of esa 's education department told the bbc news website .
other passengers sseti express shares a ride into space with china 's beijing-1 microsatellite built in the uk by surrey satellite technology .
beijing-1 carries the china mapping telescope , a very powerful high-resolution instrument build by uk scientists at sira , instrumentation and measurement experts , to map and photograph chinese territory .
it will help plan projects associated with the 2008 beijing olympics and monitor and manage natural as well as man-made disasters .

millions around the world play , meet up , battle , buy and sell in online games and virtual worlds , such as second life and world of warcraft .
but to many , these virtual goings-on can be a total mystery .
armed with his lens , photo journalist robbie cooper has been facing up to gamers , revealing their intricate lives and identities to the rest of the world .
last year , his alter egos exhibition in london showed off the people behind the avatars - their virtual representations .
it was a fascinating and comforting peek into the very ordinary and familiar faces of gamers and virtual worlders .
this year , he has cast his lens further afield into china and korea to get the stories behind the avatars .
" i wanted to build on what i had done before and get more cultural variety and more personal variety , " he told the bbc news website .
part of life " i wanted to see people who use female avatars , women who use male avatars , and also people who earn their living from doing this - from buying and selling virtual goods , or creating programs to operate people 's characters . "
one player he met in the virtual world , second life , earns $ 70,000 a year creating female avatar clothing , he says .
another player , mark -lrb- aka marcos fonzarelli in second life -rrb- has turned himself into a " robot tailor " , designing robot costumes that characters can wear .
admittedly , it is a niche market , says mark , but he still earns $ 250 a month .
pictures : gamers unmasked the only resource is his time , for which people pay ; there are 60,000 members who could potentially pay .
according to the robot tailor , the real money is in the female clothing market .
mr cooper says that makes sense when one considers the hugely lucrative beauty and clothing market in the physical world .
it seems natural that the same kinds of rules and practices that occur in physical life will happen in virtual worlds too .
that became evident when residents were urged to donate to the katrina hurricane aid effort , via the game .
a virtual memorial with candles was even created .
" we live in a virtual world anyway , " says mr cooper .
" democracy is virtual , politics is virtual ; all this stuff and information we get in the newspaper - a lot of it is public relations stuff . "
when virtual turns real but mr cooper 's pictures show that those boundaries between the virtual and the " real " are blurring in other parts of the world , particularly in asia .
the photos captured the fascinating and largely unseen world of workers in china and korea who earn their keep by looking after people 's characters in games while they are at work , or asleep .
a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it robbie cooper qing xu wei , for example , used to make 10,000 yuan -lrb- £ 692 -rrb- a month by power-levelling other people 's game characters while they are away from the game .
the programs he creates runs on seven computers , each churning out power points so that gamers can get their characters up to a certain strength and status .
" from their point of view it is understandable .
when a new game comes out , do you want to start at the bottom or have someone do that for you to get to level at which it is fun to play ? " he explains .
one shot shows what , at first glance , might be mistaken for a virtual room from within a game .
with newspapers as wallpaper , posters of fantasy figures , and scruffy bedding , it is in fact a room in a net cafe in tianjin , china .
it is used by employees who work for a dollar a day levelling up player 's characters .
up to 30 will work for 16 hours , using the room to sleep in shifts .
dark economics ?
to chinese gamers , it does not seem unusual that there would be people working on every level of the economic food chain , says mr cooper .
the gamers there , he added , had reams of stories about in-game cheating and stolen accounts .
buying and selling gaming items such as imaginary weapons is a booming business on the web .
the internet games section of ebay saw more than $ 9m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- in trades in 2003 alone .
" a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it , " he says .
a room in a chinese net cafe used by employees who work and sleep in shifts enlarge image earlier this year , a shanghai online gamer was given a suspended death sentence for killing a fellow gamer when he found out the friend had sold his virtual sword , which he had lent him , for 7,200 yuan -lrb- £ 473 -rrb- .
this kind of criminal activity which happens as a result of events occurring in a game could become more common .
china has no laws to deal with the theft of virtual property .
but in south korea , where gaming is treated as a mainstream sport , there is a police unit that investigates in-game crime .
according to mr cooper , this shows how seriously gaming is being taken , especially when real-life money and value plays a part .
" a lot of people i met did not have as much sentiment about the games as they do in the west .
in china you do what you have to do to get by , " he explains .
but there is more to " value " in game playing than just economics , says mr cooper .
" this whole thing is about value and if people are willing to pay money for something , it has some kind of value to them .
value is more than money ; it is emotional value , time , and work . "
when gamers find emotional value and a sense of accomplishment through online games and virtual worlds , that can sometimes be just as worthy .
mr cooper 's most recent photos will be on show at a playstation 2 supported exhibition tour starting 9 november in amsterdam .

but there is more to " value " in game playing than just economics , says mr cooper .
" this whole thing is about value and if people are willing to pay money for something , it has some kind of value to them .
value is more than money ; it is emotional value , time , and work . "
when gamers find emotional value and a sense of accomplishment through online games and virtual worlds , that can sometimes be just as worthy .
mr cooper 's most recent photos will be on show at a playstation 2 supported exhibition tour starting 9 november in amsterdam .

millions around the world play , meet up , battle , buy and sell in online games and virtual worlds , such as second life and world of warcraft .
but to many , these virtual goings-on can be a total mystery .
armed with his lens , photo journalist robbie cooper has been facing up to gamers , revealing their intricate lives and identities to the rest of the world .
last year , his alter egos exhibition in london showed off the people behind the avatars - their virtual representations .
it was a fascinating and comforting peek into the very ordinary and familiar faces of gamers and virtual worlders .
this year , he has cast his lens further afield into china and korea to get the stories behind the avatars .
" i wanted to build on what i had done before and get more cultural variety and more personal variety , " he told the bbc news website .
part of life " i wanted to see people who use female avatars , women who use male avatars , and also people who earn their living from doing this - from buying and selling virtual goods , or creating programs to operate people 's characters . "
one player he met in the virtual world , second life , earns $ 70,000 a year creating female avatar clothing , he says .
another player , mark -lrb- aka marcos fonzarelli in second life -rrb- has turned himself into a " robot tailor " , designing robot costumes that characters can wear .
admittedly , it is a niche market , says mark , but he still earns $ 250 a month .
pictures : gamers unmasked the only resource is his time , for which people pay ; there are 60,000 members who could potentially pay .
according to the robot tailor , the real money is in the female clothing market .
mr cooper says that makes sense when one considers the hugely lucrative beauty and clothing market in the physical world .
it seems natural that the same kinds of rules and practices that occur in physical life will happen in virtual worlds too .
that became evident when residents were urged to donate to the katrina hurricane aid effort , via the game .
a virtual memorial with candles was even created .
" we live in a virtual world anyway , " says mr cooper .
" democracy is virtual , politics is virtual ; all this stuff and information we get in the newspaper - a lot of it is public relations stuff . "
when virtual turns real but mr cooper 's pictures show that those boundaries between the virtual and the " real " are blurring in other parts of the world , particularly in asia .
the photos captured the fascinating and largely unseen world of workers in china and korea who earn their keep by looking after people 's characters in games while they are at work , or asleep .
a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it robbie cooper qing xu wei , for example , used to make 10,000 yuan -lrb- £ 692 -rrb- a month by power-levelling other people 's game characters while they are away from the game .
the programs he creates runs on seven computers , each churning out power points so that gamers can get their characters up to a certain strength and status .
" from their point of view it is understandable .
when a new game comes out , do you want to start at the bottom or have someone do that for you to get to level at which it is fun to play ? " he explains .
one shot shows what , at first glance , might be mistaken for a virtual room from within a game .
with newspapers as wallpaper , posters of fantasy figures , and scruffy bedding , it is in fact a room in a net cafe in tianjin , china .
it is used by employees who work for a dollar a day levelling up player 's characters .
up to 30 will work for 16 hours , using the room to sleep in shifts .
dark economics ?
to chinese gamers , it does not seem unusual that there would be people working on every level of the economic food chain , says mr cooper .
the gamers there , he added , had reams of stories about in-game cheating and stolen accounts .
buying and selling gaming items such as imaginary weapons is a booming business on the web .
the internet games section of ebay saw more than $ 9m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- in trades in 2003 alone .
" a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it , " he says .
a room in a chinese net cafe used by employees who work and sleep in shifts enlarge image earlier this year , a shanghai online gamer was given a suspended death sentence for killing a fellow gamer when he found out the friend had sold his virtual sword , which he had lent him , for 7,200 yuan -lrb- £ 473 -rrb- .
this kind of criminal activity which happens as a result of events occurring in a game could become more common .
china has no laws to deal with the theft of virtual property .
but in south korea , where gaming is treated as a mainstream sport , there is a police unit that investigates in-game crime .
according to mr cooper , this shows how seriously gaming is being taken , especially when real-life money and value plays a part .

part of life " i wanted to see people who use female avatars , women who use male avatars , and also people who earn their living from doing this - from buying and selling virtual goods , or creating programs to operate people 's characters . "
one player he met in the virtual world , second life , earns $ 70,000 a year creating female avatar clothing , he says .
another player , mark -lrb- aka marcos fonzarelli in second life -rrb- has turned himself into a " robot tailor " , designing robot costumes that characters can wear .
admittedly , it is a niche market , says mark , but he still earns $ 250 a month .
pictures : gamers unmasked the only resource is his time , for which people pay ; there are 60,000 members who could potentially pay .
according to the robot tailor , the real money is in the female clothing market .
mr cooper says that makes sense when one considers the hugely lucrative beauty and clothing market in the physical world .
it seems natural that the same kinds of rules and practices that occur in physical life will happen in virtual worlds too .
that became evident when residents were urged to donate to the katrina hurricane aid effort , via the game .
a virtual memorial with candles was even created .
" we live in a virtual world anyway , " says mr cooper .
" democracy is virtual , politics is virtual ; all this stuff and information we get in the newspaper - a lot of it is public relations stuff . "
when virtual turns real but mr cooper 's pictures show that those boundaries between the virtual and the " real " are blurring in other parts of the world , particularly in asia .
the photos captured the fascinating and largely unseen world of workers in china and korea who earn their keep by looking after people 's characters in games while they are at work , or asleep .
a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it robbie cooper qing xu wei , for example , used to make 10,000 yuan -lrb- £ 692 -rrb- a month by power-levelling other people 's game characters while they are away from the game .
the programs he creates runs on seven computers , each churning out power points so that gamers can get their characters up to a certain strength and status .
" from their point of view it is understandable .
when a new game comes out , do you want to start at the bottom or have someone do that for you to get to level at which it is fun to play ? " he explains .
one shot shows what , at first glance , might be mistaken for a virtual room from within a game .
with newspapers as wallpaper , posters of fantasy figures , and scruffy bedding , it is in fact a room in a net cafe in tianjin , china .
it is used by employees who work for a dollar a day levelling up player 's characters .
up to 30 will work for 16 hours , using the room to sleep in shifts .
dark economics ?
to chinese gamers , it does not seem unusual that there would be people working on every level of the economic food chain , says mr cooper .
the gamers there , he added , had reams of stories about in-game cheating and stolen accounts .
buying and selling gaming items such as imaginary weapons is a booming business on the web .
the internet games section of ebay saw more than $ 9m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- in trades in 2003 alone .
" a commodity is a commodity .
if it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
in china , there is matter of fact attitude about it , " he says .
a room in a chinese net cafe used by employees who work and sleep in shifts enlarge image earlier this year , a shanghai online gamer was given a suspended death sentence for killing a fellow gamer when he found out the friend had sold his virtual sword , which he had lent him , for 7,200 yuan -lrb- £ 473 -rrb- .
this kind of criminal activity which happens as a result of events occurring in a game could become more common .
china has no laws to deal with the theft of virtual property .
but in south korea , where gaming is treated as a mainstream sport , there is a police unit that investigates in-game crime .
according to mr cooper , this shows how seriously gaming is being taken , especially when real-life money and value plays a part .
" a lot of people i met did not have as much sentiment about the games as they do in the west .
in china you do what you have to do to get by , " he explains .
but there is more to " value " in game playing than just economics , says mr cooper .
" this whole thing is about value and if people are willing to pay money for something , it has some kind of value to them .
value is more than money ; it is emotional value , time , and work . "
when gamers find emotional value and a sense of accomplishment through online games and virtual worlds , that can sometimes be just as worthy .
mr cooper 's most recent photos will be on show at a playstation 2 supported exhibition tour starting 9 november in amsterdam .
