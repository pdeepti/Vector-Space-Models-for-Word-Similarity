here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .

part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .
party leader claudia roth said the major parties had promised too much and were delivering too little . " the coalition appears to be based on the lowest common denominator . it has no accent .
the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

i think we did well by playing aggressively in midfield to stop them from creating too many chances . " saturday 's goalless result means germany are still chasing their first win over top-class international opposition since beating england 1-0 at wembley more than five years ago . france lacking star power france , however were missing their big stars with both zinedine zidane and midfielder patrick vieira out of action with groin injuries . french coach raymond domenech , who took over as coach following their quarter-final exit at euro 2004 , said the two teams played equally well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 future merkel government faces first major test monday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the smiles still be in place come monday ?
the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth . " our aim is to put an end to this downward trend and reverse it , " merkel told a news conference sunday . " i foresee that germany should in 10 years ' time be able to say it is back among the top three countries in europe . " but critics point out that the new deal will do little to put germany 's stalled economy back on track or get more than four million germans back to work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's major parties announced the coalition deal at a press conference " i simply can not recognize the influence of the -lrb- christian -rrb- union , " said conservative finance expert friedrich merz , a longtime merkel rival with a strong following in the party . " we are paying a damn high price for the chancellery , " he told weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . employers ' association president dieter hundt said that while the government had set the right goals of slashing unemployment and the spiraling public deficit , the measures it had chosen were counterproductive . " the fact the grand coalition is settling down to work with plans for a drastic tax hike will have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in germany , " he said . business leaders cautiously hopeful but federation of industry president jürgen thumann said business leaders were grudgingly accepting that a left-right government spanning the political divide could offer a chance to implement a handful of key economic reforms . " it will not liberate the economy or allow new jobs to be created immediately .
but the pact does offer a few opportunities for this term so that things were gradually get better in this country , " he told sunday 's bild am sonntag . political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen said there was no alternative to the current alliance and that the result was an agreement driven by pragmatism .
" this is not a grand vision because grand visions are not possible right now , " he said of the government program . " but the fact that all the interest groups are crying out is a rather positive sign . " schröder to bid goodbye to spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's set to depart from the political stage the spd congress will also mark the party 's farewell from schröder after seven years in power . he is expected to issue a passionate defense of the new " grand coalition " - the alliance he had favored when campaigning for office in 1998 until the vote 's outcome pushed him into a unprecedented grouping with the greens party . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de realistic , good-natured and uninspiring germany 's two major parties reached a coalition deal this week after marathon negotiations .

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .
party leader claudia roth said the major parties had promised too much and were delivering too little . " the coalition appears to be based on the lowest common denominator . it has no accent .
the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth . " our aim is to put an end to this downward trend and reverse it , " merkel told a news conference sunday .

" we are paying a damn high price for the chancellery , " he told weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . employers ' association president dieter hundt said that while the government had set the right goals of slashing unemployment and the spiraling public deficit , the measures it had chosen were counterproductive . " the fact the grand coalition is settling down to work with plans for a drastic tax hike will have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in germany , " he said . business leaders cautiously hopeful but federation of industry president jürgen thumann said business leaders were grudgingly accepting that a left-right government spanning the political divide could offer a chance to implement a handful of key economic reforms . " it will not liberate the economy or allow new jobs to be created immediately .
but the pact does offer a few opportunities for this term so that things were gradually get better in this country , " he told sunday 's bild am sonntag . political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen said there was no alternative to the current alliance and that the result was an agreement driven by pragmatism .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth .

" we are paying a damn high price for the chancellery , " he told weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . employers ' association president dieter hundt said that while the government had set the right goals of slashing unemployment and the spiraling public deficit , the measures it had chosen were counterproductive . " the fact the grand coalition is settling down to work with plans for a drastic tax hike will have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in germany , " he said . business leaders cautiously hopeful but federation of industry president jürgen thumann said business leaders were grudgingly accepting that a left-right government spanning the political divide could offer a chance to implement a handful of key economic reforms .

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth . " our aim is to put an end to this downward trend and reverse it , " merkel told a news conference sunday .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .

and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 realistic , good-natured and uninspiring großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal forces many germans to save every penny germany 's two major parties reached a coalition deal this week after marathon negotiations .
the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .
party leader claudia roth said the major parties had promised too much and were delivering too little . " the coalition appears to be based on the lowest common denominator . it has no accent .
the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .
party leader claudia roth said the major parties had promised too much and were delivering too little . " the coalition appears to be based on the lowest common denominator . it has no accent .
the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .
" they drink a bottle every day , they read newspapers , eat well and also drink wine .
these are ' wine culture ' people . " this culture blends well with the family 's 750 year tradition - a tradition that kraft constantin does n't take for granted .
" it could go for another 750 years if we stay financially secure .
thus we have to go with the times and deliver both the amount of wine and quality that people expect from us . "
though hohenlohe heir does n't have any children , the family dynasty does n't seem in any great danger .
" my sister already has three sons , which should be enough to keep the heritage going , " he said . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where now for german wine ?

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .

the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable .

both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .

" the fact the grand coalition is settling down to work with plans for a drastic tax hike will have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in germany , " he said . business leaders cautiously hopeful but federation of industry president jürgen thumann said business leaders were grudgingly accepting that a left-right government spanning the political divide could offer a chance to implement a handful of key economic reforms .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the chancellor vote explained schröder confirms exit ; slams bush grand coalition a delicate balancing act news -pipe- 13.11.2005 the crunch issues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chronically high unemployment is one of germany 's biggest problems almost two months after an inconclusive election , germany 's major parties have forged a coalition deal for a four-year term under chancellor angela merkel .
here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 trial raises questions about germany 's incest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should sex between siblings be legal in germany ?
following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .

the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .
" they drink a bottle every day , they read newspapers , eat well and also drink wine .
these are ' wine culture ' people . " this culture blends well with the family 's 750 year tradition - a tradition that kraft constantin does n't take for granted .
" it could go for another 750 years if we stay financially secure .
thus we have to go with the times and deliver both the amount of wine and quality that people expect from us . "
though hohenlohe heir does n't have any children , the family dynasty does n't seem in any great danger .
" my sister already has three sons , which should be enough to keep the heritage going , " he said . aarni kuoppamäki -lrb- aal -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where now for german wine ?

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 trial raises questions about germany 's incest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should sex between siblings be legal in germany ?
following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending .

both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 trial raises questions about germany 's incest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should sex between siblings be legal in germany ?
following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

" if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament .

both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday . " i expect a few serious rows monday in karlsruhe , " said deputy spd leader , ute vogt , referring to the congress 's venue in southwestern germany . " but in the end the spd will rise to its duty . " if the parties accept it , the program will be formally signed friday in central berlin and three days later merkel will be elected as germany 's first female chancellor by the bundestag or lower house of parliament . " a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .
" this is not a love match but a very sober marriage of convenience , " incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck told reporters saturday . measures do n't go far enough : critics the german economy - the biggest in the european union - is saddled with chronic unemployment and near-zero growth . " our aim is to put an end to this downward trend and reverse it , " merkel told a news conference sunday . " i foresee that germany should in 10 years ' time be able to say it is back among the top three countries in europe . " but critics point out that the new deal will do little to put germany 's stalled economy back on track or get more than four million germans back to work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's major parties announced the coalition deal at a press conference " i simply can not recognize the influence of the -lrb- christian -rrb- union , " said conservative finance expert friedrich merz , a longtime merkel rival with a strong following in the party . " we are paying a damn high price for the chancellery , " he told weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . employers ' association president dieter hundt said that while the government had set the right goals of slashing unemployment and the spiraling public deficit , the measures it had chosen were counterproductive . " the fact the grand coalition is settling down to work with plans for a drastic tax hike will have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in germany , " he said . business leaders cautiously hopeful but federation of industry president jürgen thumann said business leaders were grudgingly accepting that a left-right government spanning the political divide could offer a chance to implement a handful of key economic reforms . " it will not liberate the economy or allow new jobs to be created immediately .
but the pact does offer a few opportunities for this term so that things were gradually get better in this country , " he told sunday 's bild am sonntag . political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen said there was no alternative to the current alliance and that the result was an agreement driven by pragmatism .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .
germany 's unemployment rate , well above 10 percent , is described as the main challenge facing the country . yawning budget deficit : a third crucial focus of the deal is an agreement to bring germany 's ballooning budget deficit back within european union borrowing limits by 2007 - a major challenge requiring upwards of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- in savings or extra revenues . federalism : long-awaited overhaul of germany 's cumbersome federal system , shifting the division of power between the country 's 16 regional states and the federal government in berlin .
the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .
but , the details still have to be worked out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .
" they drink a bottle every day , they read newspapers , eat well and also drink wine .
these are ' wine culture ' people . " this culture blends well with the family 's 750 year tradition - a tradition that kraft constantin does n't take for granted .
" it could go for another 750 years if we stay financially secure .
thus we have to go with the times and deliver both the amount of wine and quality that people expect from us . "

" we know that with this coalition pact we are expecting a lot from people , " she told a press conference . merkel said that controversial measures such as raising value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 to 19 percent from its current level of 16 percent were " honest " and crucial elements of the coalition program between merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats of outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders of the major parties finally struck a deal friday in addition , the agreement includes strict job protection regulations , raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 , raising income tax levels to plug a growing public deficit and imposing a so-called " rich tax " on people earning more than 250,000 euros a year .
a central focus of the government agenda is to tackle germany 's chronically high unemployment rate . the program must be approved by party congresses on monday . their green light would pave the way for the parliament to make merkel germany 's first woman chancellor on november 22 , more than two months since an inconclusive general election left the country in political limbo . " a declaration of bankruptcy " but even as merkel spoke of the coalition pact as offering germany " a real chance " of pulling itself out of its ongoing economic crisis , the deal was attacked by business leaders who warn it may further strangle investment , trade unions fearful of a weakening of workers ' rights , battle-ready opposition parties and a skeptical media . " the coalition deal is a declaration of bankruptcy , " the top-selling bild newspaper said saturday .
an editorial said taxpayers were being made to pay for the mistakes of successive governments . " the two big parties which , in doing nothing to tackle the situation in recent decades , have brought the country to the point of bankruptcy , are making us , the people , pay for their mistakes . " the centre-left berliner zeitung n ewspaper labeled the agreement " a big disappointment " and said it offered few long-term solutions . " it is hoped that this coalition pact will only be temporary and that this government realizes once it takes office that the agreement can not last for long , " it added . business leaders fearful industry leaders and analysts said they feared the deal would further dampen consumer spending . " tax hikes are likely to depress consumers , " ubs economist holger fahrinkrug said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in berlin protest against social and labor market reforms " as far as the labor market is concerned , these reforms lack the necessary clout .
we need a functioning labor market if we 're eventually going to resolve our difficulties , " said martin wansleben of the dihk organization . " raising pension contributions shows we can expect further reforms here too . " there were no words of praise from the trade unions either .
they vehemently oppose plans to make it easier to hire and fire workers . opposition joins storm of protest opposition parties also launched an attack on the new government 's tax policy , warning that the higher value-added tax will hurt consumer spending and cut into economic growth . guido westerwelle , the leader of the pro-business free democrats with whom merkel had originally planned to form a coalition government , said : " this orgy of tax increases agreed by the grand coalition could just as easily have been the work of the last government .
we do n't need new elections for that .
the bottom line is that the grand coalition 's program is n't favorable to employment and the creation of new jobs . " the widely unpopular vat hike will be used partly to bolster strained finances and partly to bring down non-wage labor costs to promote hiring of staff . the social democrats managed to force through a higher tax rate for top earners in the face of conservative opposition .
the retirement age will be increased to 67 from 65 and the percentage of salary earmarked for the state pension system will be upped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth will have to get used to being in the opposition the opposition green party criticized the package as lacking ambition .
party leader claudia roth said the major parties had promised too much and were delivering too little . " the coalition appears to be based on the lowest common denominator . it has no accent .
the coalition has presented no concepts on issues concerning the future - like health care , pensions , integration and the creation of new jobs , " roth said . foggy foreign policy goals foreign policy goals are vague , with a promise to improve relations with the united states which were weakened over german opposition to the iraq war , and strengthen ties with eu partners . the parties also accepted a neutral approach to turkey 's bid to join the eu . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government pact finally in place germany 's main parties on friday finalized a program for incoming chancellor angela merkel 's left-right coalition government , ending nearly two months of political uncertainty in europe 's biggest economy .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .

" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 trial raises questions about germany 's incest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should sex between siblings be legal in germany ?
following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

" i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .
in addition to that , workers ' rights will be weakened as will job protection measures . finally being honest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rival politicians are willing to take painful steps together one of the positive things to emerge from the long week of negotiations was the fact that both the conservatives and the social democrats were finally ready to look the truth in the face together .
the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .
but , that could rebound on them when it comes to implementing policy .
so much of new-found harmony between the two parties could also threaten both with a loss of profile - something that is advantageous to the smaller parties in opposition . no love marriage so , this is no love match , no red-green -lrb- the colors of the former government -rrb- reform project , no intellectual-moral transformation as was the case in 1982 . it 's enough , to start with , when truth raises its head in budgetary policies and when antiquated political rituals , such as blocking sensible legislation in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament simply for narrow tactical reasons , go out of fashion .
or the tendency of the larger parties to paint a rosy picture of the country 's situation or dramatize , depending on who 's at the helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder 's style and rhetoric were the focus of debate during the election the social democrats had portrayed angela merkel as boring and even cold and emotionless during the election campaign and had presented their jovial gerhard schröder as the antithesis . but , merkel won the election though she came away with some major scratches .
it 's quite possible that her government will look exactly the same : dull , realistic , without vision . but , that does n't necessarily have to be bad for the country . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new government program comes under attack incoming chancellor angela merkel called saturday for germans to make sacrifices to help put their struggling economy back on track , but her future government 's policies are already under fire .

here are the main points . the manifesto outlines reform measures for the unlikely alliance of conservatives and social democrats , who have joined forces to govern germany in a so-called " grand coalition " once before in the 1960s . the following are the main problems the government tackles in its power-sharing agreement : weak economy : the main thrust of the coalition deal is on reviving the stagnant germany economy , the largest in the european union .
once the economic motor of europe , germany now has one of the weakest growth rates in the 25-nation eu .
the economy is expected to grow by a mere 0.8 percent this year and improve only slightly in 2006 . high unemployment : in addition , merkel 's incoming government has vowed to make fighting high unemployment the centerpiece of their deal .

the current system , weighted in favor of the regions , has hindered the implementation of much-needed reforms . much of the solutions proposed by merkel 's government in solving the country 's most pressing problems lie in raising taxes : vat hike : the parties agreed to a controversial three percentage point hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- in 2007 , an idea championed by the conservatives during the election campaign .
part of the vat hike will go towards cutting non-wage labor costs - a measure that many believe is crucial in encouraging german firms to hire . rich tax : in return for agreeing to the vat hike , the social democrats secured conservative agreement for a so-called " rich tax , " which raise the income bracket for germans earning 250,000 euros or more , from 42 percent currently to 45 percent . retirement age : in addition , the government plans to raise the retirement age from the current 65 to 67 . job protection : the government also plans to loosen job protection laws , making it easier for companies to hire and fire people .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .
" they drink a bottle every day , they read newspapers , eat well and also drink wine .
these are ' wine culture ' people . " this culture blends well with the family 's 750 year tradition - a tradition that kraft constantin does n't take for granted .
" it could go for another 750 years if we stay financially secure .
thus we have to go with the times and deliver both the amount of wine and quality that people expect from us . "

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .

" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .

" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .

the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .
even though german white wine is held in high regard around the world , in their own country german wine makers have a difficult time turning a profit . every second bottle of wine sold in germany is sold in discount grocery stores such as aldi or lidl .
only every third bottle costs more then two euros .
hohenlohe wine however , costs on average 7.50 euros .
röll justifies the above-average price by pointing out that the vines grow on steep mountain slops that ca n't be harvested by machine .
" it 's handwork - a lot of handwork and a lot of care and that comes at a price . " discerning wine drinkers relatively few germans are willing to dig deep into their pockets to pay a premium price for a premium wine that goes for two or even 10 times what is sold in discount stores .
for the high price you get a better wine , explained röll .
" a good wine is like a good person , " he said .
" the wine has to show where it comes from , where it grew , what region it belongs to .
it can have rough edges but it ca n't be artificially arranged - it has to taste good . " two hundred thousand bottles of wine are produced annually at fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen , more then half of which go to private customers and connoisseurs who want to know exactly where their wine comes from .
thus , the winery holds over 200 press viewings , exhibitions and wine tastings each year to court this sophisticated crowd .
" these are rather ' wine crazy ' people , " said kraft constantin .
" they drink a bottle every day , they read newspapers , eat well and also drink wine .
these are ' wine culture ' people . " this culture blends well with the family 's 750 year tradition - a tradition that kraft constantin does n't take for granted .
" it could go for another 750 years if we stay financially secure .
thus we have to go with the times and deliver both the amount of wine and quality that people expect from us . "
though hohenlohe heir does n't have any children , the family dynasty does n't seem in any great danger .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

" none of us was prepared for a grand coalition - none of you either , " he told the joint news conference .
" we learned to make compromises . " germany has been locked in political limbo since an inconclusive september 18 election which forced the christian democrats , who managed a narrow victory , to open coalition talks with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's premier peter müller tells reporters the good news friday 's deal is the product of last-minute horse-trading on contentious issues such as new taxation and the future of the country 's nuclear power plants . new faces , old challenges the pact seeks to tackle the daunting problems facing the ailing economy , including measures to close a record to close a record 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 41-billion -rrb- gap in the public deficit and bring down the 11-percent jobless rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , left and merkel are the two new easterners on the block merkel and incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck , an ambitious state leader , are both from the former communist east and mark the first time that easterners are at the helm of german politics . franz müntefering , who will be vice-chancellor and labor minister , will hand over the spd reins to platzeck at a party congress next week , where delegates must also sign off on the government manifesto . the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , are to approve the pact at separate congresses monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synergy between merkel , left and schröder has n't been the best the way will then be clear for merkel to be voted in november 22 , six months after schröder said he would seek new elections to win a fresh mandate for his much-maligned economic reform drive . the nuts and bolts the parties agreed in their program to raise the main value-added tax rate by three points to 19 percent from 2007 , an unpopular measure whose revenue will be used to plug the budget and lower non-wage labor costs to promote hiring . the retirement age will gradually be raised to 67 from 65 . in a largely symbolic move aimed at promoting " social justice " , the social democrats also managed to box through an income tax surplus , a so-called " rich tax " for high earners -lrb- more than 250,000 euros a year -rrb- in the face of strong conservative opposition . compromise and continuation one crucial area where the new government will continue the legacy of its predecessor is nuclear energy . schröder 's government had committed itself to gradually phasing out nuclear power , a point that most conservatives opposed tooth and nail .
the issue was set to be one of the most serious stumbling blocks in coalition negotiations between the two sides .
but merkel 's new government , in a sign of compromise , now says it will continue on the same course and shut down all of the country 's nuclear power plants over the next two decades . on foreign policy , the incoming government will seek improved relations with the united states - strained over german opposition to the iraq war and strengthen ties with european union partners . the parties also accepted a compromise formulation on turkey 's bid to join the european union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition partners say government will be formed by weekend germany 's main political parties said they want to reach agreement friday on a program for the incoming coalition government , ending almost two months of political limbo following inconclusive elections .

the ink is barely dry on the pact for incoming chancellor merkel 's grand coalition government , but germany 's major parties will face their first tough test when the deal is put to their rank-and-file for approval monday . the agreement sealed friday by merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for a power-sharing government is to serve as a policy roadmap for a four-year term . but the members of both parties as well as the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , must still give their blessing and sparks are expected to fly when the three parties meet separately on monday .

" a marriage of convenience " many social democrats are angry about a proposed three-point hike in the value-added tax to 19 percent in 2007 - blasted by critics as the biggest single tax increase in german postwar history . they also oppose plans to loosen protections against dismissal of staff . meanwhile conservatives are frustrated that the vat rise will not be fully earmarked for cutting non-wage labor costs with the aim of bringing down the 11-percent jobless rate .
both sides were forced to back away from their campaign promises when neither won a ruling majority in the september general election .
hard-fought compromises were the result of four weeks of horse-trading .

the agreement is hardly a stroke of genius , but it does include painful cuts for citizens . there was much laughter during the press conference on friday as the conservatives and the social democrats presented their power-sharing agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is optimistic the new power-sharing deal will work germany 's incoming chancellor angela merkel was in the best of spirits .
both sides stressed that the new " grand coalition " was hardly a love match , rather a pragmatic " marriage of convenience . " that 's how the coalition deal reads as well .
the more than 100-page agreement is n't , by any stretch , a stroke of genius .
neither the neo liberal dreams of the conservatives floated during the election campaign nor the social democrats ' promises that things would n't get worse for the average citizen , are to be found within its pages . angela merkel 's cabinet guarantees a year of preparation for the new , really painful , cuts .
during this time , both sides hope , the economy will spring to life .
and then the going will be tough . a hike in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent , higher pension contributions , slashes in public finances - all that starting 2007 .

the precarious budgetary situation was no longer glossed over and that leads one to hope that something will finally be done about it . starting next year , subsidies for home-owners will be axed - something that was long overdue .
and a tax write-off for commuters will only be guaranteed for those who really need to travel long stretches to get to work .
together with a new spurt to reform germany 's tangled federalist system , they represent the three large chunks which long seemed impossible to reform . the two partners want to work together in a sober and practical manner and , as far as possible , without committing the mistakes of the previous government .
in addition , the two sides want to keep out ideology when it comes to tackling the work at hand . sticking points that have the potential to cause serious tensions - such as health policy and nuclear power phase-out - were simply not touched upon by the two parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.11.2005 trial raises questions about germany 's incest law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should sex between siblings be legal in germany ?
following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable . " the question is whether criminal law should be used to safeguard cultural , purely moral beliefs of society , " joachim renzkikowski , an expert for sexual criminal law at halle university , told deutschlandradio . " i would say no . " renzkikowski added that the incest law was the last of its kind as others , such as a law against adultery and another penalizing homosexual sex were taken off the books decades ago . parliame n tary review others , who are in a position to push for change , said they would seriously consider a review of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim stünker " i think we should calmly check whether it 's still appropriate , " said joachim stünker , a former judge and the social democratic party 's legal affairs spokesperson in parliament , adding that he will suggest a review in the legislature 's legal affairs committee . but jörg van essen , stünker 's counterpart for the opposition free democratic party , said he thought the law should remain in place . " i believe that the state should hold off when two people love each other , but we have a responsibility towards the children , " said essen , a former prosecutor . he added that the law should serve as a deterrent and help prevent children from being born with disabilities that result from genetic defects . ethics vs. ge n etics the question of whether children from an incestuous relationship stand a higher chance of being disabled is a contentious issue among medical experts . while some say that such a connection can not be made , others cite studies showing that 50 percent of children parented by siblings or as a result of sex between parents and their children , are at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts differ on whether incest produces more disabled children " the fact that we deal with people who are disabled as a result of incest is proof enough , " said ulrike dierkes , who runs a support organization for children born as a result of incestuous sex . dierkes , who was born after her father had sex with her sister but is not disabled , said she would actually back tightening the law to cover the unlikely case of artificial insemination . " i 'm not interested in morality , " she said , adding that she did n't think consenting incestuous relationships should be punished as long as they do n't result in children being born . dierkes said she was happy with the leipzig court 's decision to send patrick to prison . patrick 's lawyers on the other hand have said they will appeal to germany 's highest court to review the constitutionality of the law . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

following a recent high-profile incest trial , legal experts have called for a review of germany 's incest law , saying that consensual sex between siblings should no longer be punishable . for his incestuous relationship with his sister , a judge in the eastern german town of leipzig sentenced patrick s. to two and a half years in prison this week .
the 28-year-old man grew up with foster parents and did n't meet his 21-year-old biological sister , susan k. until 2000 .
the judge placed susan under the supervision of social services for one year . since they met , the siblings have had four children .
after the first child , patrick received a suspended sentence .
he began serving a 10-month prison sentence in connection with the second and third child shortly after fathering the fourth . punishing sex , not reproduction while it was procreation that led to the trials , patrick was actually sentenced for sleeping with his sister rather than fathering the children . that 's because germany 's incest law only punishes heterosexual intercourse between close relatives such as siblings or parents and their children .
that means that infertile siblings would face prosecution while a sister who gets inseminated artificially with the sperm of her brother would not have to stand trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish siblings maria rosa and daniel moya were not prosecuted for parenting children saying that the law is based on outdated moral concepts , legal experts have said that germany should follow the example of many other countries , such as france , belgium , the netherlands , luxembourg , portugal , turkey , japan , argentina or brazil , where incest is no longer punishable .

" i am pleased to tell you that the pact for the second grand coalition at federal level in the history of the federal republic of germany is finished , " a smiling merkel told reporters . it ensures merkel will become germany 's first female chancellor , and comes just ahead of a self-imposed saturday deadline . outgoing spd leader franz müntefering acknowledged that the odds had been against a government straddling the political divide or a so-called " grand coalition " , last seen in germany in the 1960s .
" none of us was prepared for a grand coalition - none of you either , " he told the joint news conference .
" we learned to make compromises . " germany has been locked in political limbo since an inconclusive september 18 election which forced the christian democrats , who managed a narrow victory , to open coalition talks with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saarland 's premier peter müller tells reporters the good news friday 's deal is the product of last-minute horse-trading on contentious issues such as new taxation and the future of the country 's nuclear power plants . new faces , old challenges the pact seeks to tackle the daunting problems facing the ailing economy , including measures to close a record to close a record 35-billion-euro -lrb- $ 41-billion -rrb- gap in the public deficit and bring down the 11-percent jobless rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : platzeck , left and merkel are the two new easterners on the block merkel and incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck , an ambitious state leader , are both from the former communist east and mark the first time that easterners are at the helm of german politics . franz müntefering , who will be vice-chancellor and labor minister , will hand over the spd reins to platzeck at a party congress next week , where delegates must also sign off on the government manifesto . the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union , are to approve the pact at separate congresses monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synergy between merkel , left and schröder has n't been the best the way will then be clear for merkel to be voted in november 22 , six months after schröder said he would seek new elections to win a fresh mandate for his much-maligned economic reform drive . the nuts and bolts the parties agreed in their program to raise the main value-added tax rate by three points to 19 percent from 2007 , an unpopular measure whose revenue will be used to plug the budget and lower non-wage labor costs to promote hiring . the retirement age will gradually be raised to 67 from 65 . in a largely symbolic move aimed at promoting " social justice " , the social democrats also managed to box through an income tax surplus , a so-called " rich tax " for high earners -lrb- more than 250,000 euros a year -rrb- in the face of strong conservative opposition . compromise and continuation one crucial area where the new government will continue the legacy of its predecessor is nuclear energy . schröder 's government had committed itself to gradually phasing out nuclear power , a point that most conservatives opposed tooth and nail .
the issue was set to be one of the most serious stumbling blocks in coalition negotiations between the two sides .
but merkel 's new government , in a sign of compromise , now says it will continue on the same course and shut down all of the country 's nuclear power plants over the next two decades . on foreign policy , the incoming government will seek improved relations with the united states - strained over german opposition to the iraq war and strengthen ties with european union partners . the parties also accepted a compromise formulation on turkey 's bid to join the european union . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition partners say government will be formed by weekend germany 's main political parties said they want to reach agreement friday on a program for the incoming coalition government , ending almost two months of political limbo following inconclusive elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines vintners toast german wine 's popularity culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.11.2005 family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riesling anyone ?
the fürst zu hohenlohe-oehringen winery in baden-württemberg , whose wines have graced the tables of german princes and royalty for 750 years , is the country 's oldest family-owned and operated business . the stairs to the cellar wind down over nine meters -lrb- 29 feet -rrb- into a kind of primordial cave . at the foot of the stairs a barrel the size of a stagecoach is adorned with carvings of grapes as well as two lions holding a shield bearing the royal family crest of hohenlohe-oehringen . in 1253 , the royal family was granted a vineyard which today ranks as germany 's oldest family-run businesses .
the vineyard is currently headed by kraft constantin zu hohenlohe-oehringen , who is himself the 27th generation in a long line of hohenlohe-oehringen vintners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hohenlohe-oehringen family crest in spite of all the tradition surrounding the winery , methods have changed quite a bit over the years .
" i would n't want to drink the wine from 750 years ago , " said kraft constantin .
" one can pass on quite a bit of knowledge from generation to generation , but what 's much more important is that one learns what can be improved upon . " in 1838 , the hohenlohe family moved to silesia , in present-day poland , where they ran the business from afar ; after world war ii the hohenlohe-oehringens returned to öhringer castle and the great family wine cellar . a new beginning in the early 1970s the once-esteemed vineyards were in a state of disrepair and made " fair to bad wine " according to kraft constantin . about this time his father teamed up with vintner siegfried röll to rebuild the business and invest in new equipment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards at the fürst zu hohenlohe oehringen winery after almost 30 years röll still works at the vineyard where he planted over 13 different types of grapes over 58 acres , 53 percent of which are riesling . riesling wine sells particularly well abroad and composes a large portion of german wine exports .
considered to be ' typical german wine , ' the annual turnover for riesling alone tops 430 million euros -lrb- $ 473 million -rrb- .
" we have a latitude that allows the grapes to ripen to a fruity , yet sour condition that they ca n't reach in warmer countries " said siegfried röll .
" therefore , our riesling is a true german , württemberg and hohenloher specialty . " the winery exports mainly to britain , belgium and the netherlands .

" when i drove here after hearing about the earthquake , i felt sure our family 's days in muzaffarabad had come to an end , " says the 26-year-old who lost his teenage sister to the disaster .
" but after burying my sister in this soil , my view has changed - we can not leave this city behind , " he says .
" right now , this is the only place to be . "
muzaffarabad looks as if it has been smashed by a cosmic fist , some two-thirds of its structures ground to dust by october 's earthquake .
the road here from islamabad , through high winding valleys lined by sparkling rivers , offers ominous hints of the heartbreaking scenes ahead .
dramatic cracks run through the tarmac and entire trees have been turned brown , draped in the dust of fresh landslides .
but nothing i saw on the road could have prepared me for the incredible generosity of the people who had lost all they loved to the quake .
raw grief on the festival day of eid , marking the end of the muslim holy month of ramadan , malik naseem emerged from the ruins of his house with steaming bowls of " sevian " - a sweet delicacy .
" we used to celebrate eid with our family and friends , " he said , offering me a bowl .
" but the earthquake took those familiar faces away and brought you media people here instead .
" so we celebrate with you .
you are our family this year . "
beneath this instinctive warmth came a reminder of the raw grief of muzaffarabad .
malik naseem asked me if i had enjoyed my time in his city .
i said i had met many good people .
" no , " he replied , crouching and cradling his head in his hands , " the good people were all killed in the earthquake .
only we are left . "
texting the mood i visited muzaffarabad to put questions posted by readers of the bbc news website to the survivors of the earthquake .
a common question - could any good come of the catastrophe - brought a surprising response .
many survivors said the quake had been a leveller in every sense , a truly democratic disaster that had destroyed the lives of rich and poor alike .
in the teeming tent cities where thousands of families endure bitter cold and poor sanitation , homeless university professors and civil servants spoke in perfect english of their desire to see a new , more equitable society rise from the ruins .
behind broken walls , i saw expensive microwave ovens and computers that testified to the shattered aspirations of muzaffarabad 's middle class .
mobile phone text messages , circulated on the day of eid , seemed to sum up the public mood .
" shattered homes , shocked faces , scattered people , stony eyes , toppled tombstones and desolation everywhere .
anyway ...
eid greetings , " read one message , composed in a mixture of english and poetic urdu .
' shaming fact ' news of remote himalayan villages untouched by telecom networks reaches muzaffarabad on foot .
every day brings a new influx of families into the city .
they have trekked weeks in search of food and shelter , bearing stories that seem impossible to confirm .
they speak of children plucked alive from the rubble three weeks after the quake and of entire villages swept away by landslides .
one man told me of a remote village that was covered - but not entirely crushed - by rocks .
under a ceiling of stone , the villagers carried on as before , surviving on food from the bazaar , until a team from a neighbouring area dug them out .
the tales told by relief workers returning from the upper reaches of the himalayas are no less incredible .
pete manfield , who has been advising the un on building shelters in the neelum valley , says " helicopters have been landing on knife edges " to reach isolated settlements .
" four weeks into an emergency , we 're still discovering people who 've received no relief whatsoever . "
it is a " shaming " fact , he says , that the shortfall in international aid pledges means help still can not reach the neediest .

survivors in a city of rubble enlarge image " when i drove here after hearing about the earthquake , i felt sure our family 's days in muzaffarabad had come to an end , " says the 26-year-old who lost his teenage sister to the disaster .
" but after burying my sister in this soil , my view has changed - we can not leave this city behind , " he says .
" right now , this is the only place to be . "
muzaffarabad looks as if it has been smashed by a cosmic fist , some two-thirds of its structures ground to dust by october 's earthquake .
the road here from islamabad , through high winding valleys lined by sparkling rivers , offers ominous hints of the heartbreaking scenes ahead .
dramatic cracks run through the tarmac and entire trees have been turned brown , draped in the dust of fresh landslides .
but nothing i saw on the road could have prepared me for the incredible generosity of the people who had lost all they loved to the quake .
raw grief on the festival day of eid , marking the end of the muslim holy month of ramadan , malik naseem emerged from the ruins of his house with steaming bowls of " sevian " - a sweet delicacy .
eid reminds malik naseem of missing friends and relatives " we used to celebrate eid with our family and friends , " he said , offering me a bowl .
" but the earthquake took those familiar faces away and brought you media people here instead .
" so we celebrate with you .
you are our family this year . "
beneath this instinctive warmth came a reminder of the raw grief of muzaffarabad .
malik naseem asked me if i had enjoyed my time in his city .
i said i had met many good people .
" no , " he replied , crouching and cradling his head in his hands , " the good people were all killed in the earthquake .
only we are left . "
texting the mood i visited muzaffarabad to put questions posted by readers of the bbc news website to the survivors of the earthquake .
a common question - could any good come of the catastrophe - brought a surprising response .
a way of life lost in the quake enlarge image many survivors said the quake had been a leveller in every sense , a truly democratic disaster that had destroyed the lives of rich and poor alike .
in the teeming tent cities where thousands of families endure bitter cold and poor sanitation , homeless university professors and civil servants spoke in perfect english of their desire to see a new , more equitable society rise from the ruins .
behind broken walls , i saw expensive microwave ovens and computers that testified to the shattered aspirations of muzaffarabad 's middle class .
mobile phone text messages , circulated on the day of eid , seemed to sum up the public mood .
" shattered homes , shocked faces , scattered people , stony eyes , toppled tombstones and desolation everywhere .
anyway ...
eid greetings , " read one message , composed in a mixture of english and poetic urdu .
' shaming fact ' news of remote himalayan villages untouched by telecom networks reaches muzaffarabad on foot .
every day brings a new influx of families into the city .
they have trekked weeks in search of food and shelter , bearing stories that seem impossible to confirm .
children who survived the quake face a bleak winter in the camps they speak of children plucked alive from the rubble three weeks after the quake and of entire villages swept away by landslides .

mohammed javed , chair of the cardiff police advisory committee , said the case had panicked the community .
the man - one of five people detained during raids the same day in the uk - is awaiting an immigration tribunal .
the home office and the department of constitutional affairs have refused to comment on specific cases .
speaking on the politics show on bbc wales on sunday , mr javad - chair of the cardiff police advisory committee - said the seizure of the libyan national in the wake of the july bombings had already made " quite a bit of difference " to race relations in wales .
" people in islamic communities are asking , ' who is next ? ' , " he said .
" if people can come and pick anybody without disclosing why they are doing it , it will affect race relations in wales .
" this one arrest has already made quite a bit of difference to race relations here . "
mr javed has grave concerns the libyan has been held at long lartin prison in worcestershire since being arrested in a raid at his home in thornhill street , canton , on 3 october .
four other men were seized the same day , in london and the west midlands .
a total of 22 people have been detained under the immigration act 1971 as part of a crackdown on terrorists and their alleged supporters in the wake of the 7 july suicide bombings in london .
' torture or execution ' the act gives powers to deport individuals and to detain them pending deportation .
the man detained in cardiff was the first in wales to be held following the attacks .
he is being detained - pending an immigration tribunal - because the uk government considers his presence in wales is " not conducive to the public good " .
but , six weeks since the start of his detention , no specific charges have been brought against him .
the man 's solicitor sean mcloughlin has said if his client is deported to libya , he may face torture or even execution .
" it 's most distressing and , when you look at the bigger picture and the whole process , we say entirely one-sided and extremely unfair , " he added .
article 3 of the european convention on human rights prevents people from being deported to a regime whre they may face torture amnesty international is outraged that the uk government recently signed a memorandum of understanding with libya that such torture would not take place .
if it proves acceptable in law , it will pave the way for deportations to libya .
" that document is n't worth the paper it is written on , " said amnesty international 's welsh director , eleanor white .
" our concerns are that libya is a country where we have documented torture and grave human rights abuses .
" for for the uk to have a memorandum of understanding that does n't even include any monitoring whatsovever is simply a way of getting around the commitment not to return somebody to a country where they might be tortured . "

the government has allocated £ 7.8bn over the next 10 years to deal with them .
so , in october 2005 , it proposed setting up a compensation scheme under the nhs redress bill .
the department of health wants claims under £ 20,000 out of the courts to limit the spiralling costs involved .
but there are concerns that an organisation that currently contests claims , the nhs litigation authority , would be responsible for setting it up and running it .
rob and ann brown , who live near taunton , have just settled a claim of £ 14,000 against musgrove park hospital following the death of their son samuel four years ago .
they have deep reservations that such a scheme would work , having used the legal process to find out how he died because they were not satisfied with they way they handled their concerns .
" speak to other people who have gone through the same thing we have and they will tell you that all they want is to find out what happened , and an apology if that is necessary , " said rob .
" if we had not gone to a clinical negligence lawyer , we would not have found out the truth , " said ann .
they have since had two other children at the hospital - charlotte , three , and lidia , aged eight months .
they say they have had excellent care , and bear no grudges .
they now plan to give their compensation to charity .
musgrove park hospitals said : " it would not be appropriate for us to comment on this specific case with the family 's expressed permission .
" however taunton and somerset nhs trust welcomes the proposals made for the nhs redress bill .
" we are aware that the current system for handling and responding to clinical negligence claims in the nhs can appear complex and slow .
" taunton and somerset nhs trust always seeks to investigate thoroughly concerns raised by patients , relatives or carers about the care they have received at the hospital . "
peter walsh , chief executive of the charity action against medical accidents says he has " serious concerns " about the redress bill as it stands , and that " it is unlikely to be fair to patients and families and would lack credibility and public confidence " .
the charity 's main concern was that the nhs litigation authority will decide whether cases have merit , and then offer compensation , while trying to cut costs .
in a statement the department of health said the authority was the " ideal choice " to oversee its proposed scheme .
it added : " the nhs redress scheme will offer patients an alternative to litigation , avoiding the long delays and legal costs typical of the current system .
" however , patients will , of course , retain the right to litigate .
" the nhs redress bill means fairness for patients , not fees for lawyers .
it is an important step in preventing a us-style litigation culture . "

the government has allocated £ 7.8bn over the next 10 years to deal with them .
so , in october 2005 , it proposed setting up a compensation scheme under the nhs redress bill .
the department of health wants claims under £ 20,000 out of the courts to limit the spiralling costs involved .
but there are concerns that an organisation that currently contests claims , the nhs litigation authority , would be responsible for setting it up and running it .
rob and ann brown , who live near taunton , have just settled a claim of £ 14,000 against musgrove park hospital following the death of their son samuel four years ago .
they have deep reservations that such a scheme would work , having used the legal process to find out how he died because they were not satisfied with they way they handled their concerns .
" speak to other people who have gone through the same thing we have and they will tell you that all they want is to find out what happened , and an apology if that is necessary , " said rob .
" if we had not gone to a clinical negligence lawyer , we would not have found out the truth , " said ann .
they have since had two other children at the hospital - charlotte , three , and lidia , aged eight months .
they say they have had excellent care , and bear no grudges .
they now plan to give their compensation to charity .
musgrove park hospitals said : " it would not be appropriate for us to comment on this specific case with the family 's expressed permission .
" however taunton and somerset nhs trust welcomes the proposals made for the nhs redress bill .
" we are aware that the current system for handling and responding to clinical negligence claims in the nhs can appear complex and slow .
" taunton and somerset nhs trust always seeks to investigate thoroughly concerns raised by patients , relatives or carers about the care they have received at the hospital . "
peter walsh , chief executive of the charity action against medical accidents says he has " serious concerns " about the redress bill as it stands , and that " it is unlikely to be fair to patients and families and would lack credibility and public confidence " .
the charity 's main concern was that the nhs litigation authority will decide whether cases have merit , and then offer compensation , while trying to cut costs .
in a statement the department of health said the authority was the " ideal choice " to oversee its proposed scheme .
it added : " the nhs redress scheme will offer patients an alternative to litigation , avoiding the long delays and legal costs typical of the current system .
" however , patients will , of course , retain the right to litigate .
" the nhs redress bill means fairness for patients , not fees for lawyers .
it is an important step in preventing a us-style litigation culture . "
