as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .
the chair of the council just happens to be bavaria 's former state cultural minister , hans zehetmair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .
until then , students in bavaria and nrw can still use the old rules without fear of seeing red ink on their homework and tests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.08.2005 fears still mar ties between border towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the river between frankfurt and slubice is shallow but fears run deep business links between german border towns and their new eu neighbors in poland should be flourishing but the discrepancies in pay and production costs are causing jitters in places like frankfurt an der oder . the river oder is quite shallow between the german border town of frankfurt an der oder and the polish town of slubice .
so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news .
-lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- a tale of two cities on the german-polish border while frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- seems to lack appeal to germans , people in neighboring slubice , on the polish side of the river , may jump at the chance to live in one of the thousands of vacant apartments in the border town .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news .
-lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- a tale of two cities on the german-polish border while frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- seems to lack appeal to germans , people in neighboring slubice , on the polish side of the river , may jump at the chance to live in one of the thousands of vacant apartments in the border town .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.08.2005 fears still mar ties between border towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the river between frankfurt and slubice is shallow but fears run deep business links between german border towns and their new eu neighbors in poland should be flourishing but the discrepancies in pay and production costs are causing jitters in places like frankfurt an der oder . the river oder is quite shallow between the german border town of frankfurt an der oder and the polish town of slubice .
so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .

" prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " back to first page back 2/2 how can values like " freedom " and " equality " be better transported to muslim immigrants ? by making clear that they are not primarily christian values , but rather universal ones that can be embraced by everyone irrespective of their religion .
every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .
what we need are new answers and a more discerning strategy based on preventive security measures on the one hand and integration and dialogue on the other .
how far away are we from that ideal situation ? there will always be people who withdraw into their so-called parallel worlds .
but as long as it concerns small groups , one can deal with it .
our problem is n't that districts like kreuzberg in berlin are home to many immigrants - that 's normal in a western city in a globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is that unemployment rates and the number of people on welfare are often higher in neighborhoods with a high immigrant population .
and parents - germans as well as successful people from immigrant backgrounds who belong to the middle class - send them to schools in other districts .
that 's when it becomes problematic .
we have to take care to prevent such segregated neighborhoods from turning into social flashpoints . there is a tendency in germany to pretend that integration has failed .
that only disheartens people who have been successful in their efforts at intercultural dialogue and integration .
again , that 's akin to playing into the hands of fundamentalists by giving in to panic and saying that everything 's hopeless .
there are several successful examples germans and non-germans living together in harmony .
there 's also a lot of potential for innovation , change and new ideas among immigrants . what we have to do is act where there are problems - in schools , in providing access to education , fighting unemployment , encouraging those aspiring to the middle class and also in the development of a common consciousness as a german irrespective of ethnic origin . sonia phalnikar interviewed cem özdemir back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .
what we need are new answers and a more discerning strategy based on preventive security measures on the one hand and integration and dialogue on the other .

we have to take care to prevent such segregated neighborhoods from turning into social flashpoints . there is a tendency in germany to pretend that integration has failed .
that only disheartens people who have been successful in their efforts at intercultural dialogue and integration .
again , that 's akin to playing into the hands of fundamentalists by giving in to panic and saying that everything 's hopeless .
there are several successful examples germans and non-germans living together in harmony .
there 's also a lot of potential for innovation , change and new ideas among immigrants . what we have to do is act where there are problems - in schools , in providing access to education , fighting unemployment , encouraging those aspiring to the middle class and also in the development of a common consciousness as a german irrespective of ethnic origin . sonia phalnikar interviewed cem özdemir back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "

one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .

the federation is on the point of acquiring a property in the german capital , she told the daily . while the memorial center will not be near the holocaust memorial , opened in may in the heart of the capital , it " should be in a central location , " she said . at least 12 million germans were displaced at the end of the war , either fleeing the advancing soviet army , or later expelled from eastern european countries when the fighting stopped . but the idea of building a " center of expulsion " in berlin has angered poland and the czech republic , who also had many of their citizens forcibly moved during and after the war . the plans have been supported by germany 's opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , whose leader angela merkel is tipped by opinion polls to become chancellor in general elections in september . steinbach herself is a cdu member of parliament . cdu 's merkel in favor of memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " the questions of -lrb- historical -rrb- responsibility have been completely resolved , " merkel said in an interview due to be broadcast sunday on germany 's ard television .
" but i think with 12 million people concerned , it is important to show this aspect of history . " germany 's current social democrat and greens coalition government has criticized plans to build a memorial in berlin , and has supported efforts to launch a foundation linking germany , poland , hungary and slovakia . schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the center , he believes , should be " europeanized . " schröder keen on alternative , european location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has repeatedly asked the bdv to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place for the memorial , saying that , by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . supporters keen on german link in expulsion debate steinbach , however , argues that the german capital is the perfect home for the center while the association 's vice president , peter glotz , has argued that it is now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz glotz has said that while the forced exit of germans from the sudeten lands in the present-day czech republic clearly had its roots in the atrocities committed by germany under adolf hitler , it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günter grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse . neighboring countries fearful of berlin home along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . there have also been calls from prominent czech officials that the center should be built in the czech republic . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .

the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.08.2005 fears still mar ties between border towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the river between frankfurt and slubice is shallow but fears run deep business links between german border towns and their new eu neighbors in poland should be flourishing but the discrepancies in pay and production costs are causing jitters in places like frankfurt an der oder . the river oder is quite shallow between the german border town of frankfurt an der oder and the polish town of slubice .
so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .
the chair of the council just happens to be bavaria 's former state cultural minister , hans zehetmair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .
until then , students in bavaria and nrw can still use the old rules without fear of seeing red ink on their homework and tests .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

" schröder keen on alternative , european location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has repeatedly asked the bdv to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place for the memorial , saying that , by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . supporters keen on german link in expulsion debate steinbach , however , argues that the german capital is the perfect home for the center while the association 's vice president , peter glotz , has argued that it is now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz glotz has said that while the forced exit of germans from the sudeten lands in the present-day czech republic clearly had its roots in the atrocities committed by germany under adolf hitler , it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günter grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse . neighboring countries fearful of berlin home along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . there have also been calls from prominent czech officials that the center should be built in the czech republic . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens .

prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .

" he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .

" schröder keen on alternative , european location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has repeatedly asked the bdv to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place for the memorial , saying that , by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . supporters keen on german link in expulsion debate steinbach , however , argues that the german capital is the perfect home for the center while the association 's vice president , peter glotz , has argued that it is now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz glotz has said that while the forced exit of germans from the sudeten lands in the present-day czech republic clearly had its roots in the atrocities committed by germany under adolf hitler , it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günter grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse . neighboring countries fearful of berlin home along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . there have also been calls from prominent czech officials that the center should be built in the czech republic . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens .

prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended .

" walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack . " we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp .
" what happened was completely wrong .

exactly 60 years earlier , on july 31 , 1945 the german men , women and children who lived in the town in the north of what was then czechoslovakia , were attacked , beaten and thrown into the river .
after the war czechoslovakia expelled some 2.5 million of its german citizens in retaliation for their support of hitler 's annexation of czechoslovakia .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . " walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack . " we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp .
" what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp .
the exact number of victims is still not known . dw-world.de berlin close to new " center of expulsion " controversial plans to build a memorial center in berlin to the millions of people forced to move during and after world war ii are well advanced , the head of a german expellee association said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .

the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .

the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .

" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .
the chair of the council just happens to be bavaria 's former state cultural minister , hans zehetmair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .
until then , students in bavaria and nrw can still use the old rules without fear of seeing red ink on their homework and tests .
those in the other 14 states , must face the fact that they will lose points for not using the new spelling rules . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .
many of those expelled died during the so-called " death march " when the outcasts were forced to return to germany by foot . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .

" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .

the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .

" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .
the chair of the council just happens to be bavaria 's former state cultural minister , hans zehetmair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .
until then , students in bavaria and nrw can still use the old rules without fear of seeing red ink on their homework and tests .
those in the other 14 states , must face the fact that they will lose points for not using the new spelling rules . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2005 opinion : much ado about nothing in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president khatami -lrb- center -rrb- at the isfahan nuclear plant iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .

in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.08.2005 fears still mar ties between border towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the river between frankfurt and slubice is shallow but fears run deep business links between german border towns and their new eu neighbors in poland should be flourishing but the discrepancies in pay and production costs are causing jitters in places like frankfurt an der oder . the river oder is quite shallow between the german border town of frankfurt an der oder and the polish town of slubice .
so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .
but not everyone is convinced of the good news .
-lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- a tale of two cities on the german-polish border while frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- seems to lack appeal to germans , people in neighboring slubice , on the polish side of the river , may jump at the chance to live in one of the thousands of vacant apartments in the border town .
-lrb- sept .
10 , 2003 -rrb- introducing euro helps strengthen polish economy now that poland is a member of the eu , the country is looking ahead to the future .
leszek balcerowicz , head of poland 's central bank , told dw-world his country is striving to introduce the euro as soon as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " back to first page back 2/2 how can values like " freedom " and " equality " be better transported to muslim immigrants ? by making clear that they are not primarily christian values , but rather universal ones that can be embraced by everyone irrespective of their religion .
every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .
what we need are new answers and a more discerning strategy based on preventive security measures on the one hand and integration and dialogue on the other .
how far away are we from that ideal situation ? there will always be people who withdraw into their so-called parallel worlds .
but as long as it concerns small groups , one can deal with it .
our problem is n't that districts like kreuzberg in berlin are home to many immigrants - that 's normal in a western city in a globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is that unemployment rates and the number of people on welfare are often higher in neighborhoods with a high immigrant population .
and parents - germans as well as successful people from immigrant backgrounds who belong to the middle class - send them to schools in other districts .
that 's when it becomes problematic .
we have to take care to prevent such segregated neighborhoods from turning into social flashpoints . there is a tendency in germany to pretend that integration has failed .
that only disheartens people who have been successful in their efforts at intercultural dialogue and integration .
again , that 's akin to playing into the hands of fundamentalists by giving in to panic and saying that everything 's hopeless .
there are several successful examples germans and non-germans living together in harmony .
there 's also a lot of potential for innovation , change and new ideas among immigrants . what we have to do is act where there are problems - in schools , in providing access to education , fighting unemployment , encouraging those aspiring to the middle class and also in the development of a common consciousness as a german irrespective of ethnic origin . sonia phalnikar interviewed cem özdemir back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .

" this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .

" prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .
my father was beaten to death and then thrown into the river , " erhart , 86 , told afp . " what happened was completely wrong .
the germans were people like us czechs , " jaroslav musial , chairman of the usti region of the czech freedom fighters association , told afp . usti nad labem becomes the second czech town after brno to mark the suffering of the sudeten germans .
four years ago , the town issued a formal recognition and expressed regret for the expulsion of 20,000 germans shortly after the end of the war .
many of those expelled died during the so-called " death march " when the outcasts were forced to return to germany by foot . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .

the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .

she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .

" we are very advanced , " the president of the german expellees federation -lrb- bdv -rrb- , erika steinbach , said in an interview in the monday edition of the volkszeitung newspaper .
the federation is on the point of acquiring a property in the german capital , she told the daily . while the memorial center will not be near the holocaust memorial , opened in may in the heart of the capital , it " should be in a central location , " she said . at least 12 million germans were displaced at the end of the war , either fleeing the advancing soviet army , or later expelled from eastern european countries when the fighting stopped . but the idea of building a " center of expulsion " in berlin has angered poland and the czech republic , who also had many of their citizens forcibly moved during and after the war . the plans have been supported by germany 's opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , whose leader angela merkel is tipped by opinion polls to become chancellor in general elections in september . steinbach herself is a cdu member of parliament . cdu 's merkel in favor of memorial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " the questions of -lrb- historical -rrb- responsibility have been completely resolved , " merkel said in an interview due to be broadcast sunday on germany 's ard television .
" but i think with 12 million people concerned , it is important to show this aspect of history . " germany 's current social democrat and greens coalition government has criticized plans to build a memorial in berlin , and has supported efforts to launch a foundation linking germany , poland , hungary and slovakia . schröder said he believes the project - which is supported by several prominent left-wing intellectuals in germany - would be better off housed in another central european country .
the center , he believes , should be " europeanized . " schröder keen on alternative , european location bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder schröder has repeatedly asked the bdv to reconsider whether berlin really is the right place for the memorial , saying that , by housing the center in berlin , germans would run the risk of being at the forefront of the expulsion debate and the historic reasons why millions were expelled from their homes during the 20th century could become blurred . although millions were expelled from their homelands during the last century as the continent 's boundaries were re-drawn time and time again through war , it is the 15 million ethnic germans who were expelled from former nazi-occupied territories at the end of world war ii who draw the most attention . supporters keen on german link in expulsion debate steinbach , however , argues that the german capital is the perfect home for the center while the association 's vice president , peter glotz , has argued that it is now acceptable to rethink the traditional line on the expulsion of ethnic germans following the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz glotz has said that while the forced exit of germans from the sudeten lands in the present-day czech republic clearly had its roots in the atrocities committed by germany under adolf hitler , it is now becoming " acceptable " to also admit what happened to german expellees was unjust . but the plans to house the center in berlin have several critics other than gerhard schröder , including nobel prize-winning author günter grass , who himself grew up in danzig , now in present day poland , and the president of the german parliament wolfgang thierse . neighboring countries fearful of berlin home along with polish and czech intellectuals , who oppose giving the center a berlin home , they say granting the bdv 's wishes could re-ignite nationalist ideas in germany . according to them , a more european-focused center should be created . and various non-german cities including the formerly german breslau , now wroclaw in poland , or the city of görlitz-zgorzelec on the german-polish border have been suggested as possible sites . there have also been calls from prominent czech officials that the center should be built in the czech republic . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : nazis caused fate of sudeten german chancellor gerhard schröder tuesday condemned critics of the czech republic 's refusal to abolish wartime decrees forcing the expulsion of the " sudeten " german minority from czechoslovakia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2005 opinion : much ado about nothing in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president khatami -lrb- center -rrb- at the isfahan nuclear plant iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2005 opinion : much ado about nothing in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president khatami -lrb- center -rrb- at the isfahan nuclear plant iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .
-lrb- aug .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .

a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " back to first page back 2/2 how can values like " freedom " and " equality " be better transported to muslim immigrants ? by making clear that they are not primarily christian values , but rather universal ones that can be embraced by everyone irrespective of their religion .
every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .
what we need are new answers and a more discerning strategy based on preventive security measures on the one hand and integration and dialogue on the other .
how far away are we from that ideal situation ? there will always be people who withdraw into their so-called parallel worlds .
but as long as it concerns small groups , one can deal with it .
our problem is n't that districts like kreuzberg in berlin are home to many immigrants - that 's normal in a western city in a globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is that unemployment rates and the number of people on welfare are often higher in neighborhoods with a high immigrant population .
and parents - germans as well as successful people from immigrant backgrounds who belong to the middle class - send them to schools in other districts .
that 's when it becomes problematic .
we have to take care to prevent such segregated neighborhoods from turning into social flashpoints . there is a tendency in germany to pretend that integration has failed .
that only disheartens people who have been successful in their efforts at intercultural dialogue and integration .
again , that 's akin to playing into the hands of fundamentalists by giving in to panic and saying that everything 's hopeless .
there are several successful examples germans and non-germans living together in harmony .
there 's also a lot of potential for innovation , change and new ideas among immigrants . what we have to do is act where there are problems - in schools , in providing access to education , fighting unemployment , encouraging those aspiring to the middle class and also in the development of a common consciousness as a german irrespective of ethnic origin . sonia phalnikar interviewed cem özdemir back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .

" he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens . " prague remains unmoved on sudeten question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaclav klaus the decision to commemorate the massacre had also led to a spat in the upper echelons of the czech government with president vaclav klaus reprimanding jiri paroubek , the prime minister , for wanting to honor the victims of the massacre .
klaus -lrb- photo -rrb- was quoted as saying that paroubek must be " out of his mind . " the issue of the sudeten germans is a thorny one which still causes tension between the czech republic and germany .
prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .
unveiling the bronze plaque , usti mayor petr gandalovic emphasized that the victims had been innocent people killed after the end of the war . " this plaque should be an expression of our grief towards these unnecessary victims and at the same time it should be an acknowledgement of what happened , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops enter prague in 1939 .
" we ca n't compare the suffering of german citizens to that of czechoslovak citizens under the german occupation but it 's important to emphasize that those who lost their lives here exactly 60 years ago did so several weeks after the war ended . " he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .
" we germans were without rights so i ran away to germany but my parents were too old to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2005 germany 's spelling divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do i have to capitalize that word or not ?
as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .
until then , students in bavaria and nrw can still use the old rules without fear of seeing red ink on their homework and tests .
those in the other 14 states , must face the fact that they will lose points for not using the new spelling rules . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german spelling debate reignites german spelling is once again at the center of political debate , despite the fact that an across-the-board reform went into effect six years ago .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .

as of monday , the new spelling rules for german officially take effect .
pupils have been making the adjustment to the new rules for years , but two states say more time is needed . the classrooms in germany are still empty as summer vacation continues .
children are not thinking about homework , and most probably they not paying much attention to the continuing debate amongst adults about the new orthographic norms .
as of aug .
1 , though , if they do n't watch their p 's , q 's and other letters , at least according to the new german orthography , then they will be penalized - at least in 14 of germany 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just a few examples of spelling reform suggestions bavaria and north rhine-westphalia , which make up over one-third of germany 's population and are ruled by the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have decided to be more lenient with their kids and allow more time to still use the old rules .
the resistance of the two states may not cause a return to old ways , but they are causing great irritation , particularly since germany 's two alpine neighbors , austria and switzerland , have implemented the new orthographic reforms with hardly a peep .
criticism from within own ranks the spelling reform in germany has created such a stir for many reasons , but much depends on which party is ruling a state and whether the political atmosphere allows resistance .
since educational matters are a state affair , bavaria and nrw can refuse to implement the agreed-upon spelling reform .
just a few months ago , when nrw was still ruled by the social democrats , there was no talk of not implementing the reforms .
also , the summer period , when the bundestag parliament is in recess , is often a time to take advantage of the lull in political coverage within the media .
some politicians like to score points in the press .
the spelling reform has generated tons of coverage .
some newspapers , most prominently , germany 's leading newspaper , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , still adheres to the old rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german press has had a field day with the spelling reform debate yet the current head of the kultusministerkonferenz -lrb- kmk -rrb- , germany 's council which deals with educational matters that go beyond state and national borders , is unhappy with the refusal of bavaria and nrw .
" we have a problem in germany with all reforms , even with the spelling reform , " said jutta wanka , a member of the opposition , in german radio .
she does n't understand why two states would want to opt out of a reform that kids have learned for the past six years .
she thinks the two states must realize that it is also a disadvantage to those pupils who leave bavaria or nrw and move to a state where only the new rules apply .
deadline of summer 2006 the bavarians and those in nrw are sticking to their guns though .
they want to wait for the final word from the council for spelling reform , the council has had the task of determining just which orthographic changes , if any , should be made - and still must be made .
the chair of the council just happens to be bavaria 's former state cultural minister , hans zehetmair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on bavarian radio , he said the decision by bavaria and nrw was rational .
after all , it wo n't be until the summer of 2006 that the possible changes should be completed .

the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2005 opinion : much ado about nothing in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president khatami -lrb- center -rrb- at the isfahan nuclear plant iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.08.2005 fears still mar ties between border towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the river between frankfurt and slubice is shallow but fears run deep business links between german border towns and their new eu neighbors in poland should be flourishing but the discrepancies in pay and production costs are causing jitters in places like frankfurt an der oder . the river oder is quite shallow between the german border town of frankfurt an der oder and the polish town of slubice .
so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .
" the planning permission was easier to get in poland and the staff was cheaper there , " patzelt said .
" but the management company -lrb- which runs the course -rrb- remained here in frankfurt . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looked like the start of a beautiful relationship ; german know-how on one side of the bridge and polish labor on the other .
however , the relationship does not seem to be working out as well for the germans as it is for the poles . hans-jürgen stroh , a businessman whose technology company r & m builds points , masts and signal arrangements for deutsche bahn , believes that the days of cross-border cooperation are numbered .
r & m produces parts in poland while development , distribution and high technology projects are based in frankfurt .
" if i 'm honest , " he said , " i would prefer to produce much more in the east . " eastern workers paid a lot less stroh pays his workers 2,500 euros a month -lrb- $ 3,058 -rrb- in frankfurt while the ones in poland are paid 550 euros and the ones in romania just 60 euros .
" i ask myself , ' why do n't we move the work somewhere else where it is cheaper ? " '
stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .
with the prospects of some businesses moving their whole production facilities to countries like poland and romania , the likelihood of increased unemployment is creating a siege mentality in frankfurt . but some frankfurt retailers ca n't see what all the fuss is about . they see the poles not as new competition but new customers .
" they do n't just come here now to pick asparagus and strawberries , " says perfumery owner karin schwarz , " they come here to shop . " poles are welcome customers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karen schwarz -lrb- r -rrb- in her perfumery with her assitants .
and shop in schwarz 's shop they do .
a good third of the customers in her perfumery come from poland ; some even travel from east of poznan , more than 200 kilometers away .
eu membership has given some poles more disposable income to buy prestigious western goods . those who do not see the poles as a threat are in the minority .
when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .
in the end , she hired the perfect candidate who just happened to be polish . hostilities arising from fear the hostile atmosphere can be traced back to the late 1980s when the economic situation of the former east german town began to slowly deteriorate .
the population of 87,000 inhabitants has now shrunk to 65,000 as people have left to find work elsewhere ; 14 percent of the apartments stand empty and every fifth person in frankfurt an der oder is jobless .
the fact that things are no better in slubice is of scant consolation . " people are simply afraid that things are going to get worse " , mayor patzelt says .
he himself has been criticized in the local press for looking eastwards .
" this hurts but what should i do ? "
if the frankfurters can not understand the opportunities that exist over the border then , he says , there 's not much he can do to convince them otherwise . lack of cooperation is a two-way street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and it seems that the germans of frankfurt an der oder are not the only ones who are stubbornly fighting cross-border cooperation .
one year ago , the frankfurter brauhaus gmbh wanted to export its beer to poland . however , once the beer started to arrive in slubice , a vicious campaign in the national polish press eventually persuaded the company to abandon its attempt .
the company then turned its eyes to the spanish and hungarian market . the waters of the oder may be shallow but the resentment on both sides of the river run a lot deeper . kerstin hilt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

so shallow in fact that a little more than a year ago , a handful of refugees would wade across the oder every night from poland heading for the west . things have changed in the past months , however .
earlier , poles looking for work and a better life would cross into germany .
now , ever since the eu 's eastern expansion went ahead in may 2004 , the envious glances have been crossing the oder in the opposite direction . frankfurt an der oder and slubice share a common economic area halfway between berlin and the polish industrial metropolis of poznan .
for martin patzelt , the mayor of the german town , the dream of cooperation was boosted by the accession of his polish neighbors . that dream looked to become a reality when a new golf course was built in slubice .

stroh rhetorically asks .
there seems to be nothing stopping him .
there are no more delivery delays from poland now that the country 's eu status means no duties to pay and if romania joins the bloc in 2007 , there will also be nothing preventing r & m moving there . the cheap labor in the east is proving to be a worry for many business employees in the frankfurt oder area .

when schwarz interviewed prospective assistants for her perfumery from slubice , in an attempt to hire a native pole to help in her dealings with the newly liberated capitalists from over the border , she experienced some opposition . some of her german customers were hostile and even angry with her for not giving a german youngster a chance , something the local labor office also took offence to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.08.2005 opinion : much ado about nothing in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing president khatami -lrb- center -rrb- at the isfahan nuclear plant iranian technicians are expected to remove the un seals to a nuclear power plant .
the eu is unhappy but dw 's mideast expert peter philipp does n't think that the move should change negotiation strategies . the announcement by the iranian government that it would resume uranium ore conversion , just when an agreement with the eu seemed so close , seems irrational and counterproductive .
nine months ago , tehran had stopped work on its nuclear program in an effort to improve the negotiating atmosphere with the eu .
despite the apparent external motives of the resumption of uranium processing , the mullahs are quite clearly playing a domestic game of politics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-to-be mahmoud ahmadinejad the current president , mohamed khatami , will be vacating his post by the middle of this week and is handing over the reins to his conservative successor , mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in such an important matter in iran , khatami did n't want to leave an impression that he had succumbed to external pressure .
not only does khatami look strong , but he prevents ahmadinejad from having to announce that iran would resume uranium conversion , and hence , only confirm to the west that the new president is a hardcore conservative .
eu image tarnished by move ?
in light of the decision to reopen the isfahan nuclear conversion facility , it would look as if tehran has duped the eu .
europe , led by the eu-3 of britain , france and germany , have invested a great amount of time and energy to try and prove to the united states that negotiating is a better tactic than saber rattling .
then , just as the eu was ready to present their newest proposals , tehran decided to play hardball .
yet , if the eu takes a step back , they will see that the iranian threats by no means mean an end to the negotiation process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : satellite photo of uranium conversion facility -lrb- ucf -rrb- at isfahan , iran with tunnel entrances to the north of the facility iranian foreign minister hamid resa asefi explicitly stated that processing would be taken up only at the isfahan plant and not at iran 's largest nuclear facility , natanz .
in addition , uranium would not be enriched .
tehran said it is still willing to meet the europeans at the negotiating table .
of particular importance is the fact that the islamic republic would continue its uranium processing under the eyes of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- .
no nuclear weapons the government in tehran has always underscored the fact that they do not want to produce atomic weapons .
iran 's latest announcement is , as unusual as it may seem , a way to get the eu to make its next move .
since 2003 , britain , france and germany have taken their time in offering their proposals .
european negotiators continually demanded tehran to extend the moratorium .
but the iranians only wanted to do that which is allowed under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , namely conduct atomic research for peaceful purposes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed elbaradei , director of the international atomic energy agency if the west expects the leaders in tehran to act in good faith , europe will have to come a step closer and support iran 's bid for membership in the wto and possibly more importantly , to push for the transfer of technology to iran in the nuclear sector .
the eu , after a long delay , wanted to accede to this demand but wanted to wait until ahmadinejad assumed office .
tehran would have preferred an earlier announcement date .
the dispute could end up being a tempest in a teapot , however .
once the iaea has addressed the issue , a few days will have passed .
and even if the un body should respond by forwarding the matter to the un security council , it 's likely that china , and even russia , will veto the imposition of any sanctions against iran . peter philipp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran readies to resume nuclear work iran officials said monday that the country will restart its nuclear program later in the day after the eu failed to respond to an offer to delay the resumption .
-lrb- aug .
1 , 2005 -rrb- eu seeks to prevent iran 's nuclear program senior officials from britain , france and germany will meet with iranian counterparts on tuesday for talks aimed at averting an escalation of a standoff with tehran over its nuclear programs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " back to first page back 2/2 how can values like " freedom " and " equality " be better transported to muslim immigrants ? by making clear that they are not primarily christian values , but rather universal ones that can be embraced by everyone irrespective of their religion .
every person who lives in our country must be willing to swear allegiance to our constitution .
it is the constitution that guarantees religious freedom and the vast majority of muslims is aware of that . what can be done to improve relations between germans and muslims , particularly with fear on the german side ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene in the berlin neighborhood of kreuzberg i understand the fear , but we have to be careful that we do n't generalize and make the mistake of doing exactly what the fundamentalists want : confrontation instead of solidarity and harmony among people of different religions in our country .
we should n't do the fundamentalists and terrorists a favor by isolating muslims and placing them under general suspicion . the strategy to counter it has to be two-pronged : we have to ensure that the security apparatus is a position to do everything it can to protect the population - this is also in the interest of moderate muslims - and at the same time we have to make sure that the coexistence of different religions works better and we have more success with integration .
it should be possible to say that i 'm a german national and of muslim faith .
in other words , we must make it possible for islam to be at home and part of a palette of religions in germany .
what we need are new answers and a more discerning strategy based on preventive security measures on the one hand and integration and dialogue on the other .
how far away are we from that ideal situation ? there will always be people who withdraw into their so-called parallel worlds .
but as long as it concerns small groups , one can deal with it .
our problem is n't that districts like kreuzberg in berlin are home to many immigrants - that 's normal in a western city in a globalized world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the problem is that unemployment rates and the number of people on welfare are often higher in neighborhoods with a high immigrant population .
and parents - germans as well as successful people from immigrant backgrounds who belong to the middle class - send them to schools in other districts .
that 's when it becomes problematic .
we have to take care to prevent such segregated neighborhoods from turning into social flashpoints . there is a tendency in germany to pretend that integration has failed .
that only disheartens people who have been successful in their efforts at intercultural dialogue and integration .
again , that 's akin to playing into the hands of fundamentalists by giving in to panic and saying that everything 's hopeless .
there are several successful examples germans and non-germans living together in harmony .
there 's also a lot of potential for innovation , change and new ideas among immigrants . what we have to do is act where there are problems - in schools , in providing access to education , fighting unemployment , encouraging those aspiring to the middle class and also in the development of a common consciousness as a german irrespective of ethnic origin . sonia phalnikar interviewed cem özdemir back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

an estimated 75,000 czechs died in forced labor camps under the nazis . the decision to dedicate a plaque to the germans killed at usti nad labem came " like a flash " , according to the magazine respekt which commented : " until now this event has been edged out of the minds of czech society by the trauma of its own citizens .

prague has so far refused to repeal the 1945 benes decrees ordering the expulsion of 2.5 million germans from czechoslovakia despite calls for it to do so as a mark of respect and admission of responsibility . the decrees stripped germans of their property and expelled them for their support for hitler 's annexation of the sudetenland area in the run-up to world war ii .
some 25,000 to 30,000 people died during the expulsions . a token of grief and acknowledgement in spite of the sensitivity of the subject and the opposition to the memorial , the ceremony on sunday went ahead .

" he added : " the czech republic 's accession to the european union and nato is a guarantee that the horrors of the last century can not be repeated . "
gandalovic is in favor of further steps to officially remember the sudeten germans including a proposed museum in usti nad labem . tales of persecution walter erhart , whose father gustav was killed that day , recalled how he had escaped to germany shortly before the attack .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2005 " we need new answers " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim immigrants in germany are once again the focus of debate the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .
german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

german-turkish politician cem özdemir told dw-world that tightening security alone would n't work in the fight against terror . germany is home to some 3.5 million muslims , the majority from turkey .
german interior minister otto schily has warned that " immigrant generations in europe are building terror cells that at are least ideologically close to al qaeda . "
schily has said that the authorities are currently watching 500 islamists and studies show that extremist ideas do find favor among some young muslims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cem özdemir dw-world spoke to cem özdemir -lrb- photo -rrb- , a german-turkish member of the green party and the european parliament who focuses on german and eu migration and integration policies as well as eu-turkey relations , about the threat of islamic fundamentalism within germany , relations between germans and muslims and what can be done to clear the atmosphere of suspicion . dw-world : since the july bombings in london , a discussion has arisen in germany about the potential of islamic radicalization among second and third generation muslim immigrants .
reports and studies show that some young muslims are susceptible to extremist ideas .
how do you explain that ? cem özdemir : the reasons are multi-layered .
it 's partly an integration problem , particularly among young males in big cities , where we have huge problems with education and employment .
and then we frequently see young people who feel cut off from society - that 's what the london example also showed .
these youngsters are born and grown up here in germany and should actually belong to our society , but who - either subjectively or objectively - have the feeling they do n't really belong . in addition , we 're now dealing with a totally new phenomenon - that of extremists apparently attempting to infect these youngsters with their fundamentalist poison .
in london , we saw that happening in pakistani schools and madrassas -lrb- islamic schools -rrb- .
it 's definitely important to find out if anything comparable is happening here in our country . the debate in germany has largely been dominated by suggestions to step up security . the interior minister is favors increasing surveillance of mosques and making it easier to deport hate preachers and imams . what do you think of such measures ? i do n't believe it will help us any further if we build up defenses along religious lines .
rather , we only have a chance if we take action on the basis of common values , and if moderate muslims work with each other as well as side by side with germans in the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mosque in the berlin district of wedding what we do need is a higher degree of readiness on the part of muslims to work together with the police and the security apparatus and to make sure that the misuse of religion is prevented .
i welcome the fact that many muslim organizations have once again taken a clear stance after the recent attacks in london and condemned them .
but they need to go a step further and be alert to the goings-on in mosques , observe what young people there are doing and , if necessary , also seek contact with the police and security authorities . the current discussion is one that comes up unfortunately after almost every terrorist attack in europe .
but , what exactly has the muslim community undertaken since the attacks of sept .
11 in the us , to rein in islamic extremism ? it 's a fundamental misunderstanding to think that the majority of people who go to mosques are academics who can speak german fluently and are familiar with all aspects of society .
rather , most of them come from a working class background ; they often have only basic training and stem from rural parts of the countries they originate from .
in other words , these aren ’ t people who know how to organize demonstrations and initiate political processes .
it 's a naïve idea to expect these people to organize themselves against terrorism . but , of course there are also people in the community who are knowledgeable about the society we live in , especially immigrants of the second generation .
that means we definitely have a communication problem even within the community .
the only way of solving the problem is by improving and intensifying cooperation among muslims themselves in german society .
i think that 's the only way of going about it .
and our society would be well advised not to lump together all muslims but rather to support the moderate ones in their fight against fundamentalistic ideas within the community as well as to support their efforts to improve the integration of the young . it 's also important that muslims increasingly view themselves as immigrants , at some time germans - and not as extended arms of the countries they originate from . continue reading to find out what özdemir has to say on tense relations between germans and muslims 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's long road to multiculturalism with possible federal polls in september , dw-world spoke to anetta kahane , one of germany 's leading anti-racism activists , about the politically-loaded topic of immigration and racism .

in a change of tactics , the guerrillas of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- have paralysed the southern province of putumayo .
they have cut off electricity to parts of the province and blockaded roads , forcing the government to airlift in basic supplies and food .
earlier this year the army insisted it had the guerrillas on the run and that the civil conflict was about to end .
such boasting has not been heard since february , when the guerrillas launched a counter-offensive that found the armed forces scrambling to respond .
terror just as soon as the army has contained one rebel action , another appears in a different part of the country .
but for over a week the guerrillas have been tightening their grip on the southern province of putumayo .
the civil population is terrified and the transport companies refuse to operate as the guerrillas have promised to burn any buses or trucks that move .
nobody believes the government assurances of protection .
the farc tactics may be changing but the aim remains the same - to discredit the us-backed government of president alvaro uribe , to ensure he is not re-elected next year .
the guerrillas want a president not quite so cosy with the white house and more amenable to negotiate on rebel terms .

an estimated 500,000 spectators lined the sea front from whitburn to roker - more than any other single day in the show 's 17-year history .
heavy rain on saturday put a dampener on air displays .
but the red arrows , the eurofighter typhoon and royal navy displays impressed the crowds on sunday .
airshow director peter chapman said : " it 's been a weekend of contrasts .
" those people who did n't come along on saturday came along in their thousands on sunday and we 're delighted to have had such a bumper crowd who saw a fantastic show .
crowds praised " all of our car parks were full to capacity by lunchtime and our contingency plans worked extremely well and our advice to anyone coming next year is to get to europe 's biggest free airshow early . "
the two-day airshow is billed as the biggest such free event in europe and attracts thousands of visitors .
research suggests the event generates up to £ 12m for the city .
police have also praised the crowds for their conduct during the event .
supt michael hartnack said : " sunday has seen the biggest crowd on any one single day in the airshow 's history .
" given the size of the crowd , we have had very few incidents to deal with and with this in mind i would like to take the opportunity to thank the public . "

domestically , he had to contend both with the impact of falling oil revenues and an increasingly fragmented society .
king fahd , who ascended the saudi throne in 1982 , was one of seven sons of the founder of saudi arabia , king abdel-aziz , and his favourite wife , hassa .
he was the fourth of his siblings to be king .
two of his brothers lost power violently - one was deposed in a coup ; the other was assassinated .
experienced politician he had a reputation as a playboy in his youth , with allegations of womanising , drinking and gambling to excess .
indeed , it is claimed that he once lost more than $ 6m in one night at the monte carlo casino .
riyadh : the modern face of saudi arabia but he settled down in the 1950s to take ministerial positions in the saudi administration .
when he became king , he already had a great deal of political experience .
he had been a reforming minister of education , playing a role in furthering the education of women in saudi arabia .
the young fahd was known as a technocrat and political wheeler-dealer .
he knew about internal security and about how the kingdom needed to be defended from within .
he also had a reputation as something of a diplomat , who understood the intricacies of foreign policy , especially the importance of the saudi dynasty 's relationship with the united states .
land of plenty such political finesse was valuable when fahd had to steer the kingdom through the leaner and more troubled period following the oil boom of the 1970s .
saudi arabia is home to the world 's greatest oil reserves and , during the 1970s , the petro-dollars flooded in .
fahd tried to balance tradition and modernity there was a joke that new cadillacs were dumped as soon as their ashtrays were full .
king fahd himself amassed a personal fortune estimated at $ 18bn .
such a boom could not be sustained .
by the early 1980s , just when king fahd came to power , annual oil income began to fall .
saudi arabia , with its huge oil production and massive reserves , had always been a paternalistic state which prided itself on giving its citizens cradle-to-grave care .
fahd was forced to introduce some austerity measures to stem state spending .
other threats to his authority came from outside .
enemies at home and abroad the 1979 revolution in iran led to fears that islamic upheaval could spread to saudi arabia .
king fahd spent vast amounts supporting iraq in its war with iran .
he also tried to strengthen his own islamic legitimacy .
in 1986 , he took the title khadim al-haramayn al-sharifayn -lrb- custodian of the two holy mosques -rrb- to indicate his protection of the sacred muslim sites in the cities of mecca and medina .
foreign troops in saudi arabia during the gulf war but the greatest threat was still to come .
in 1990 , iraq invaded neighbouring kuwait .
king fahd made the sensitive decision to invite western forces onto saudi soil to protect the kingdom .
he told his people , " these forces are participating in joint exercises with saudi arabia .
their presence will be temporary . "
after the war , though , us forces did not leave .
a bomb explosion at their desert headquarters in 1996 killed 19 and appeared to signal the depth of popular resentment .
catalogue of crises but many saudis , and muslims further afield , believed that the stationing of non-muslim soldiers in the birthplace of islam went directly against an explicit ruling of the prophet muhammad .
that impression intensified after the attacks on the united states on 11 september 2001 .
fifteen of the hijackers were thought to have been saudi nationals .
and the saudi-born osama bin laden had often pledged to drive the " infidels " out of saudi arabia .
crown prince abdullah has succeeded his half-brother at times , popular movements opposed to the royal family within the country have raised their colours , a dangerous activity in what remains a highly-repressive country .
the huge cost of the gulf war meant that the king had to take some even more stringent economic austerity measures .
king fahd found himself faced with a whole series of interlocking crises - economic , political and military - which the ailing leader seemed ill-equipped to keep under control .
experienced successor king fahd 's health had long been a problem .
he was diabetic , for many years a heavy smoker and suffered a stroke in 1995 .
officially , after a relatively short break at the time , he resumed many of his duties using a wheelchair and stick .
his chosen successor , his half-brother abdullah , is the head of the national guard , the tribal army largely responsible for the kingdom 's internal security .
an austere and respected figure , crown prince abdullah is untainted by corruption , while being regarded by many as less enthusiastically pro-american than king fahd .
and among watchers of the opaque world of saudi statecraft , crown prince abdullah is thought already to have been de facto ruler for much of the past five years .

it 's likely more than half will be from ethnic minorities .
people of african and caribbean origin make up 2 % of the uk 's population but account for more than two-thirds of sunday church-goers in london and 7 % of worshippers nationwide , research has shown .
many go to black-led churches such as glory house in east london which regularly attracts around 2,000 people to its sunday services .
set up by nigerian immigrants in 1992 with just 45 members , glory house now has a membership of 3,000 and is one of a new breed of churches principally serving the uk 's african and caribbean communities .
one of glory house 's founders , pastor jonathan oloyede , says the uk 's rapidly-growing african communities are contributing to the growth of black-led churches .
like the caribbean immigrants of the 1950s and 1960s , the more recent african arrivals also bring with them a deep-rooted church culture , the pastor says .
" christianity in africa is big in terms of lots of people going to church .
another factor is we have a strong , very vibrant ministry that is an outreach to the family and young families , so church is not just something you attend , it 's part of your life . "
tithes new figures from the christian research association show that over the last five years black church membership has grown by around 18 % compared with a 5 % drop for churches nationally . "
there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight " ' bishop joe aldred the editor of the research peter brierley says along with black-led churches , pentecostalism - where more than a third of worshippers in the uk are black - is one of the few christian growth groups .
" across the uk more churches are closing more than they 're opening .
the growth rate we are seeing in the uk largely comes from the ethnic minority groups , " mr brierley said .
black majority churches are not only successful at attracting worshippers , many are hugely financially successful too , in stark comparison to many of the uk 's traditional churches .
glory house church had a turnover of nearly £ 1.5m last year much of it in the form of tithes - donations by members of around 10 % of their income .
but the success of black-led churches is not an even picture , according to bishop joe aldred , black church spokesman for churches together in britain and ireland .
newer churches are prospering , he says , but some of those started by caribbean immigrants in the 1950s and 1960s face decline .
and he points out most black people in the uk attend mainstream churches with many in urban areas having a majority of ethnic minority parishioners .
" the church where i am pastor in birmingham , if you go back 25 years was overwhelmingly a white baptist church .
fast forward to today and 98 % of its members are black .
" there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' - as the blacks move in , the whites move out , " dr aldred says .
' significant contribution ' but in spite of their successes black-led churches often find themselves the subject of a disproportionate number of negative stories in the media , says dr robert beckford who lectures on diasporan religions and cultures at the university of birmingham .
" it 's rare that you find an unbiased analysis of black life in general and black church life in particular . "
there is still misunderstanding and misinformation about black-led churches " pastor jonathan oloyede , glory house church " scandals within the catholic church or within anglicanism never get the same kind of negative reaction that a black case will , even if it 's an isolated one , " dr beckford says .
that 's a view shared by katei kirby of the african caribbean evangelical alliance , which speaks on behalf of many of the uk 's black churches .
she points to a spate of stories which she says wrongly linked black churches with high-profile child abuse and witchcraft cases .
" the phone calls we had from some journalists were making unexplainable links between christianity , witchcraft and black culture .
" what we 've been desperately trying to do is make people understand that africans in britain , caribbeans in britain whether they go to a black-led church or not are making a significant contribution to society .
" those things do n't make the headlines because they do n't sell papers or increase viewing , " ms kirby says .
however , jonathan oloyede of glory house thinks the black churches will eventually find mainstream acceptance .

it 's likely more than half will be from ethnic minorities .
people of african and caribbean origin make up 2 % of the uk 's population but account for more than two-thirds of sunday church-goers in london and 7 % of worshippers nationwide , research has shown .
many go to black-led churches such as glory house in east london which regularly attracts around 2,000 people to its sunday services .
set up by nigerian immigrants in 1992 with just 45 members , glory house now has a membership of 3,000 and is one of a new breed of churches principally serving the uk 's african and caribbean communities .
one of glory house 's founders , pastor jonathan oloyede , says the uk 's rapidly-growing african communities are contributing to the growth of black-led churches .
like the caribbean immigrants of the 1950s and 1960s , the more recent african arrivals also bring with them a deep-rooted church culture , the pastor says .
" christianity in africa is big in terms of lots of people going to church .
another factor is we have a strong , very vibrant ministry that is an outreach to the family and young families , so church is not just something you attend , it 's part of your life . "
tithes new figures from the christian research association show that over the last five years black church membership has grown by around 18 % compared with a 5 % drop for churches nationally .
there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' bishop joe aldred the editor of the research peter brierley says along with black-led churches , pentecostalism - where more than a third of worshippers in the uk are black - is one of the few christian growth groups .
" across the uk more churches are closing more than they 're opening .
the growth rate we are seeing in the uk largely comes from the ethnic minority groups , " mr brierley said .
black majority churches are not only successful at attracting worshippers , many are hugely financially successful too , in stark comparison to many of the uk 's traditional churches .
glory house church had a turnover of nearly £ 1.5m last year much of it in the form of tithes - donations by members of around 10 % of their income .
but the success of black-led churches is not an even picture , according to bishop joe aldred , black church spokesman for churches together in britain and ireland .
newer churches are prospering , he says , but some of those started by caribbean immigrants in the 1950s and 1960s face decline .
and he points out most black people in the uk attend mainstream churches with many in urban areas having a majority of ethnic minority parishioners .
" the church where i am pastor in birmingham , if you go back 25 years was overwhelmingly a white baptist church .
fast forward to today and 98 % of its members are black .
" there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' - as the blacks move in , the whites move out , " dr aldred says .
' significant contribution ' but in spite of their successes black-led churches often find themselves the subject of a disproportionate number of negative stories in the media , says dr robert beckford who lectures on diasporan religions and cultures at the university of birmingham .
" it 's rare that you find an unbiased analysis of black life in general and black church life in particular .
there is still misunderstanding and misinformation about black-led churches pastor jonathan oloyede , glory house church " scandals within the catholic church or within anglicanism never get the same kind of negative reaction that a black case will , even if it 's an isolated one , " dr beckford says .
that 's a view shared by katei kirby of the african caribbean evangelical alliance , which speaks on behalf of many of the uk 's black churches .
she points to a spate of stories which she says wrongly linked black churches with high-profile child abuse and witchcraft cases .
" the phone calls we had from some journalists were making unexplainable links between christianity , witchcraft and black culture .
" what we 've been desperately trying to do is make people understand that africans in britain , caribbeans in britain whether they go to a black-led church or not are making a significant contribution to society .
" those things do n't make the headlines because they do n't sell papers or increase viewing , " ms kirby says .
however , jonathan oloyede of glory house thinks the black churches will eventually find mainstream acceptance .

it 's likely more than half will be from ethnic minorities .
people of african and caribbean origin make up 2 % of the uk 's population but account for more than two-thirds of sunday church-goers in london and 7 % of worshippers nationwide , research has shown .
many go to black-led churches such as glory house in east london which regularly attracts around 2,000 people to its sunday services .
set up by nigerian immigrants in 1992 with just 45 members , glory house now has a membership of 3,000 and is one of a new breed of churches principally serving the uk 's african and caribbean communities .
one of glory house 's founders , pastor jonathan oloyede , says the uk 's rapidly-growing african communities are contributing to the growth of black-led churches .
like the caribbean immigrants of the 1950s and 1960s , the more recent african arrivals also bring with them a deep-rooted church culture , the pastor says .
" christianity in africa is big in terms of lots of people going to church .
another factor is we have a strong , very vibrant ministry that is an outreach to the family and young families , so church is not just something you attend , it 's part of your life . "
tithes new figures from the christian research association show that over the last five years black church membership has grown by around 18 % compared with a 5 % drop for churches nationally .
there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' bishop joe aldred the editor of the research peter brierley says along with black-led churches , pentecostalism - where more than a third of worshippers in the uk are black - is one of the few christian growth groups .
" across the uk more churches are closing more than they 're opening .
the growth rate we are seeing in the uk largely comes from the ethnic minority groups , " mr brierley said .
black majority churches are not only successful at attracting worshippers , many are hugely financially successful too , in stark comparison to many of the uk 's traditional churches .
glory house church had a turnover of nearly £ 1.5m last year much of it in the form of tithes - donations by members of around 10 % of their income .
but the success of black-led churches is not an even picture , according to bishop joe aldred , black church spokesman for churches together in britain and ireland .
newer churches are prospering , he says , but some of those started by caribbean immigrants in the 1950s and 1960s face decline .
and he points out most black people in the uk attend mainstream churches with many in urban areas having a majority of ethnic minority parishioners .
" the church where i am pastor in birmingham , if you go back 25 years was overwhelmingly a white baptist church .
fast forward to today and 98 % of its members are black .
" there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' - as the blacks move in , the whites move out , " dr aldred says .
' significant contribution ' but in spite of their successes black-led churches often find themselves the subject of a disproportionate number of negative stories in the media , says dr robert beckford who lectures on diasporan religions and cultures at the university of birmingham .
" it 's rare that you find an unbiased analysis of black life in general and black church life in particular .
there is still misunderstanding and misinformation about black-led churches pastor jonathan oloyede , glory house church " scandals within the catholic church or within anglicanism never get the same kind of negative reaction that a black case will , even if it 's an isolated one , " dr beckford says .
that 's a view shared by katei kirby of the african caribbean evangelical alliance , which speaks on behalf of many of the uk 's black churches .
she points to a spate of stories which she says wrongly linked black churches with high-profile child abuse and witchcraft cases .
" the phone calls we had from some journalists were making unexplainable links between christianity , witchcraft and black culture .
" what we 've been desperately trying to do is make people understand that africans in britain , caribbeans in britain whether they go to a black-led church or not are making a significant contribution to society .
" those things do n't make the headlines because they do n't sell papers or increase viewing , " ms kirby says .
however , jonathan oloyede of glory house thinks the black churches will eventually find mainstream acceptance .
" i think we 're still budding , still blossoming , still maturing .

it 's likely more than half will be from ethnic minorities .
people of african and caribbean origin make up 2 % of the uk 's population but account for more than two-thirds of sunday church-goers in london and 7 % of worshippers nationwide , research has shown .
many go to black-led churches such as glory house in east london which regularly attracts around 2,000 people to its sunday services .
set up by nigerian immigrants in 1992 with just 45 members , glory house now has a membership of 3,000 and is one of a new breed of churches principally serving the uk 's african and caribbean communities .
one of glory house 's founders , pastor jonathan oloyede , says the uk 's rapidly-growing african communities are contributing to the growth of black-led churches .
like the caribbean immigrants of the 1950s and 1960s , the more recent african arrivals also bring with them a deep-rooted church culture , the pastor says .
" christianity in africa is big in terms of lots of people going to church .
another factor is we have a strong , very vibrant ministry that is an outreach to the family and young families , so church is not just something you attend , it 's part of your life . "
tithes new figures from the christian research association show that over the last five years black church membership has grown by around 18 % compared with a 5 % drop for churches nationally .
there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' bishop joe aldred the editor of the research peter brierley says along with black-led churches , pentecostalism - where more than a third of worshippers in the uk are black - is one of the few christian growth groups .
" across the uk more churches are closing more than they 're opening .
the growth rate we are seeing in the uk largely comes from the ethnic minority groups , " mr brierley said .
black majority churches are not only successful at attracting worshippers , many are hugely financially successful too , in stark comparison to many of the uk 's traditional churches .
glory house church had a turnover of nearly £ 1.5m last year much of it in the form of tithes - donations by members of around 10 % of their income .
but the success of black-led churches is not an even picture , according to bishop joe aldred , black church spokesman for churches together in britain and ireland .
newer churches are prospering , he says , but some of those started by caribbean immigrants in the 1950s and 1960s face decline .
and he points out most black people in the uk attend mainstream churches with many in urban areas having a majority of ethnic minority parishioners .
" the church where i am pastor in birmingham , if you go back 25 years was overwhelmingly a white baptist church .
fast forward to today and 98 % of its members are black .
" there is some evidence of racism in all denominations , the americans call it ' white flight ' - as the blacks move in , the whites move out , " dr aldred says .
' significant contribution ' but in spite of their successes black-led churches often find themselves the subject of a disproportionate number of negative stories in the media , says dr robert beckford who lectures on diasporan religions and cultures at the university of birmingham .
" it 's rare that you find an unbiased analysis of black life in general and black church life in particular .
there is still misunderstanding and misinformation about black-led churches pastor jonathan oloyede , glory house church " scandals within the catholic church or within anglicanism never get the same kind of negative reaction that a black case will , even if it 's an isolated one , " dr beckford says .
that 's a view shared by katei kirby of the african caribbean evangelical alliance , which speaks on behalf of many of the uk 's black churches .
she points to a spate of stories which she says wrongly linked black churches with high-profile child abuse and witchcraft cases .
" the phone calls we had from some journalists were making unexplainable links between christianity , witchcraft and black culture .
" what we 've been desperately trying to do is make people understand that africans in britain , caribbeans in britain whether they go to a black-led church or not are making a significant contribution to society .
" those things do n't make the headlines because they do n't sell papers or increase viewing , " ms kirby says .
however , jonathan oloyede of glory house thinks the black churches will eventually find mainstream acceptance .
" i think we 're still budding , still blossoming , still maturing .
in the coming years many of the black churches are going to start integrating with mainstream society but for now there is still misunderstanding and misinformation about black-led churches , " he says .
