michael willms , a waiter on the terrace at the früh brewery said he has n't noticed any major differences in the people sipping from the slim glasses of kölsch beer he delivers to their tables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael willms will practically have a view of pope benedict xvi from work in cologne 's pedestrian zone " there have been some groups with the world youth day backpacks and few more nuns and priests than usual , but there has n't been a real change in the clientele , " willms -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" i do n't think the world youth day visitors are n't really the type of people that generally like to sit around in breweries . "
in fact , during many of the scheduled wyd events willms and his co-workers wo n't be delivering many glasses of beer at all .
when pope benedict xvi comes into town on aug .
18 , much of cologne 's pedestrian zone will be closed off and früh 's terrace seating will have to be cleared as people crowd into the city for the papal procession .
cathedral cleared of pews " it is amazing how much has been organized and how clearly the city has thought everything through , " said anne becker , a cologne native who raises money for the cathedral 's renovations by selling raffle tickets .
" i think everything is going to come off without a hitch . "
however , becker also admitted that while she 's looking forward to seeing the cathedral largely empty of pews , which are being cleared away to make space for more visitors , she plans to stay away during the world youth day events , which run from aug .
15 to aug .

that 's advice that cologne locals also received from wyd organizers who implored city dwellers to stay out of the downtown area on aug .
18 unless they were interested in seeing the pope themselves as delays will be unavoidable .
klaus jürgen kopke plans to stay in town for the papal visit .
the unemployed artist made a chalk drawing dedicated to the pope thursday in front of the cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jürgen kopke 's chalk drawing in front of the cologne cathedral " i chose the subject because of the world youth day , " kopke -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" i 'm looking forward to the whole thing and hope to see the pope . "
rebecca slomski , an american student at madison university who is taking part in a summer program in bonn , is one of the thousands expected to attend the mass celebrated by the pope in marienfeld , one of cologne 's suburbs .
" it 's going to be a highlight to see a german pope in germany , " she said .
" it 's probably a once in a lifetime event . "
not everyo n e i n terested i n pope cologne resident sandra kern , 30 , said there are some wyd events that interest .
but seeing the pope is n't one of them .
" i really have a lot of problems with him , " she said .
" i do n't like his views on homosexuals , contraception or women in the priesthood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in cologne is happy that the pope is coming to town a number of organizations critical of organized religion , including the international league of non-religious and atheists , have also decided to set up a " religion-free zone " in cologne for people looking to get away from the spiritual tone that has taken over the city .
" we do n't want to insult any christians , but we want to protest that one denomination has taken over an entire city , " jacques tilly , a sculpturer who created a float of a toothless dinosaur watching over a flock of sheep that will parade through the city , told german public broadcaster wdr .
" we want to show that we are also still here . "
busi n esses ope n lo n ger regardless of their religious views , businesses have also decided to make their presence known at the event by staying open longer to cater to the thousands of visitors .
while there are still rooms in all price categories to be had , nadine rausch of köln-hotels , a hotel booking service across from the cathedral and main train station , expects a run on accommodation as the world youth day begins .
she said the agency has decided to extend its hours and is also offering visitors discounted wyd t-shirts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus mielke is interested in the world youth day mainly for business reasons inside foto lambertin , a photography shop in the shadow of the cologne cathedral , markus mielke -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted his interest in the world youth day is largely professional as the shop will extend its opening hours for visitors looking for disposable cameras , film and batteries .
" there will be a lot of people in the city and it 's going to be a busy time , " he said .
" it will be stressful , but we 'll just work through it . "

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

" we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland .

" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .
time , he concludes , is not yet ripe for such a joint effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach cesary gmyz , who writes for the polish weekly wprost said polish resentments towards the berlin center emanate not least from the fact that erika steinbach , the head of the arch-conservative german league of expellees has pushed the idea so much in recent months . " the problem is that steinbach is behind the idea of the berlin center , " he said .
" and she 's got a bad reputation throughout poland .
she has n't said anything yet on the nature of such a center .

" i do n't think images of the chancellor with artists and writers say anything about how cultivated he is , " said günter nooke , cdu spokesman for cultural affairs .
" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .

politicians rediscovering their love for the arts during an election campaign makes them suspicious . " in the current election campaign , the parties are looking for niches where they can still mobilize potential voters , " reinig said .

it does n't often excite much interest abroad , and that 's why the conservatives say they want to subsidize more big productions from the german capital in the future . at present , regional film and theater projects are the main beneficiaries of subsidies paid for by german taxes .
the spd says redistribution favoring larger and more expensive productions in berlin would leave many smaller projects without funding . " it makes me a bit worried that only mainstream productions would qualify , " griefahn said .
" in other words , the operas , plays and films that attract large audiences would continue to get publicity , because they can almost support themselves , or at least attract sponsoring .

politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .

it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .

" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .

i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .

what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .

michael willms , a waiter on the terrace at the früh brewery said he has n't noticed any major differences in the people sipping from the slim glasses of kölsch beer he delivers to their tables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael willms will practically have a view of pope benedict xvi from work in cologne 's pedestrian zone " there have been some groups with the world youth day backpacks and few more nuns and priests than usual , but there has n't been a real change in the clientele , " willms -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" i do n't think the world youth day visitors are n't really the type of people that generally like to sit around in breweries . "
in fact , during many of the scheduled wyd events willms and his co-workers wo n't be delivering many glasses of beer at all .
when pope benedict xvi comes into town on aug .
18 , much of cologne 's pedestrian zone will be closed off and früh 's terrace seating will have to be cleared as people crowd into the city for the papal procession .
cathedral cleared of pews " it is amazing how much has been organized and how clearly the city has thought everything through , " said anne becker , a cologne native who raises money for the cathedral 's renovations by selling raffle tickets .
" i think everything is going to come off without a hitch . "
however , becker also admitted that while she 's looking forward to seeing the cathedral largely empty of pews , which are being cleared away to make space for more visitors , she plans to stay away during the world youth day events , which run from aug .
15 to aug .
21 .
that 's advice that cologne locals also received from wyd organizers who implored city dwellers to stay out of the downtown area on aug .
18 unless they were interested in seeing the pope themselves as delays will be unavoidable .

" we do n't want to insult any christians , but we want to protest that one denomination has taken over an entire city , " jacques tilly , a sculpturer who created a float of a toothless dinosaur watching over a flock of sheep that will parade through the city , told german public broadcaster wdr .
" we want to show that we are also still here . "
busi n esses ope n lo n ger regardless of their religious views , businesses have also decided to make their presence known at the event by staying open longer to cater to the thousands of visitors .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

dw-world talked to her about germany 's state of affairs , the upcoming elections and the country 's future . barcomi came to berlin as a dancer 20 years ago , but decided she 'd rather roast coffee beans a few years later .
" i was tired of people saying that america has no culture , " she said and began baking cookies , cakes and muffins and hand-made bagels to convince berliners otherwise .
a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .
there 's also the theory that people still have a complex about world war ii .
but most countries do n't have a clean slate and are still able to go on and have a health country . gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i have always prided myself in being a democrat .
but if i were german and allowed to vote , i would find it very difficult to re-elect schröder .
i do n't feel that he can make the economic changes needed to get the country back in gear .
but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .

he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .

he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic .

michael willms , a waiter on the terrace at the früh brewery said he has n't noticed any major differences in the people sipping from the slim glasses of kölsch beer he delivers to their tables .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael willms will practically have a view of pope benedict xvi from work in cologne 's pedestrian zone " there have been some groups with the world youth day backpacks and few more nuns and priests than usual , but there has n't been a real change in the clientele , " willms -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" i do n't think the world youth day visitors are n't really the type of people that generally like to sit around in breweries . "
in fact , during many of the scheduled wyd events willms and his co-workers wo n't be delivering many glasses of beer at all .
when pope benedict xvi comes into town on aug .

cathedral cleared of pews " it is amazing how much has been organized and how clearly the city has thought everything through , " said anne becker , a cologne native who raises money for the cathedral 's renovations by selling raffle tickets .
" i think everything is going to come off without a hitch . "

" it 's probably a once in a lifetime event . "
not everyo n e i n terested i n pope cologne resident sandra kern , 30 , said there are some wyd events that interest .
but seeing the pope is n't one of them .
" i really have a lot of problems with him , " she said .
" i do n't like his views on homosexuals , contraception or women in the priesthood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in cologne is happy that the pope is coming to town a number of organizations critical of organized religion , including the international league of non-religious and atheists , have also decided to set up a " religion-free zone " in cologne for people looking to get away from the spiritual tone that has taken over the city .
" we do n't want to insult any christians , but we want to protest that one denomination has taken over an entire city , " jacques tilly , a sculpturer who created a float of a toothless dinosaur watching over a flock of sheep that will parade through the city , told german public broadcaster wdr .
" we want to show that we are also still here . "
busi n esses ope n lo n ger regardless of their religious views , businesses have also decided to make their presence known at the event by staying open longer to cater to the thousands of visitors .
while there are still rooms in all price categories to be had , nadine rausch of köln-hotels , a hotel booking service across from the cathedral and main train station , expects a run on accommodation as the world youth day begins .
she said the agency has decided to extend its hours and is also offering visitors discounted wyd t-shirts .

" there will be a lot of people in the city and it 's going to be a busy time , " he said .

dw-world talked to her about germany 's state of affairs , the upcoming elections and the country 's future . barcomi came to berlin as a dancer 20 years ago , but decided she 'd rather roast coffee beans a few years later .
" i was tired of people saying that america has no culture , " she said and began baking cookies , cakes and muffins and hand-made bagels to convince berliners otherwise .
a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .
there 's also the theory that people still have a complex about world war ii .
but most countries do n't have a clean slate and are still able to go on and have a health country . gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i have always prided myself in being a democrat .
but if i were german and allowed to vote , i would find it very difficult to re-elect schröder .
i do n't feel that he can make the economic changes needed to get the country back in gear .
but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .
what do you like about germa n y ? i do like that people do n't fall through the grid here .
i think it 's less commercial than the us .
the mentality here was difficult for me to understand at first , there 's a kind of neutrality that americans do no have .
people are more grounded here .
i feel like you do n't have huge discrepancy between those who have and those who have not .
i appreciate that i can have my kids take the subway and ride on busses .
what do you dislike about germa n y ? i think they could use better weather in the summertime .
i definitely had a phase when i was more anti-german , but by and large i do really like germany .
i just feel like people here always want to stay on the safe side .
i have gotten much less risky here . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

" we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland .

" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .
time , he concludes , is not yet ripe for such a joint effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach cesary gmyz , who writes for the polish weekly wprost said polish resentments towards the berlin center emanate not least from the fact that erika steinbach , the head of the arch-conservative german league of expellees has pushed the idea so much in recent months . " the problem is that steinbach is behind the idea of the berlin center , " he said .
" and she 's got a bad reputation throughout poland .
she has n't said anything yet on the nature of such a center .
will it come in the form of a museum or a scientific research center , or something else ?

" we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland . " angela merkel 's visit , coming after her visit to france , is symbolic , " he said .
" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .
time , he concludes , is not yet ripe for such a joint effort .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media .

he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .

he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .

" he has shown in recent weeks that he is carrying out these duties with a surprising lightness of touch and aplomb , " lehmann said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would he recognize himself ?

" he has shown in recent weeks that he is carrying out these duties with a surprising lightness of touch and aplomb , " lehmann said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would he recognize himself ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael willms will practically have a view of pope benedict xvi from work in cologne 's pedestrian zone " there have been some groups with the world youth day backpacks and few more nuns and priests than usual , but there has n't been a real change in the clientele , " willms -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" i do n't think the world youth day visitors are n't really the type of people that generally like to sit around in breweries . "
in fact , during many of the scheduled wyd events willms and his co-workers wo n't be delivering many glasses of beer at all .
when pope benedict xvi comes into town on aug .

" i think everything is going to come off without a hitch . "

but seeing the pope is n't one of them .
" i really have a lot of problems with him , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in cologne is happy that the pope is coming to town a number of organizations critical of organized religion , including the international league of non-religious and atheists , have also decided to set up a " religion-free zone " in cologne for people looking to get away from the spiritual tone that has taken over the city .
" we do n't want to insult any christians , but we want to protest that one denomination has taken over an entire city , " jacques tilly , a sculpturer who created a float of a toothless dinosaur watching over a flock of sheep that will parade through the city , told german public broadcaster wdr .
" we want to show that we are also still here . "
busi n esses ope n lo n ger regardless of their religious views , businesses have also decided to make their presence known at the event by staying open longer to cater to the thousands of visitors .
while there are still rooms in all price categories to be had , nadine rausch of köln-hotels , a hotel booking service across from the cathedral and main train station , expects a run on accommodation as the world youth day begins .

politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ? the election campaign might be gathering momentum , but chancellor gerhard schröder still had time to host a book launch in early august .
" art in the chancellery , " an illustrated volume about the work adorning germany 's center of power , is the sort of glossy tome one might find on a coffee table .
it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?
and then lay it out to berlin and ask if they can deliver . john kluempers interviewed jackson janes send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .

what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .

if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.08.2005 interfaith thinkers debate integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25 million muslims call europe their home scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism . europe is home to some 25 million muslims , accounting for 5.5 percent of the overall population .
since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.08.2005 interfaith thinkers debate integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25 million muslims call europe their home scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism . europe is home to some 25 million muslims , accounting for 5.5 percent of the overall population .
since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media .

he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .

he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic .

" we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland .

" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .
time , he concludes , is not yet ripe for such a joint effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach cesary gmyz , who writes for the polish weekly wprost said polish resentments towards the berlin center emanate not least from the fact that erika steinbach , the head of the arch-conservative german league of expellees has pushed the idea so much in recent months . " the problem is that steinbach is behind the idea of the berlin center , " he said .
" and she 's got a bad reputation throughout poland .
she has n't said anything yet on the nature of such a center .
will it come in the form of a museum or a scientific research center , or something else ?

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .

let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?

i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .

what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .

what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .

" i do n't think images of the chancellor with artists and writers say anything about how cultivated he is , " said günter nooke , cdu spokesman for cultural affairs .
" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .
" that makes it the most substantial and , spread over the network of the federal republic of germany , the most extensive model for theater production in the world .
it 's an established and unique system .
and if a ministerial post turns this federal system into a centralized one , i think that 's very dangerous for germany 's cultural landscape . " it 's a view shared by much of the country 's arts establishment .
any politician wanting to tamper with the existing subsidy system after the elections and manage the arts from berlin would inevitably face stiff opposition from many artists and from germany 's federal states . skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder , in the bundeskunsthalle in bonn in front of the sculpture " greetings from oslo " by the artist georg baselitz , right .
in general , most of the artists themselves view the politicking with skepticism .
politicians rediscovering their love for the arts during an election campaign makes them suspicious . " in the current election campaign , the parties are looking for niches where they can still mobilize potential voters , " reinig said .
" we know turnout will be very low , so of course they 're looking everywhere they can .
but paying lip service is n't enough for me .
we should be talking about translating words into action . " take german cinema .
it does n't often excite much interest abroad , and that 's why the conservatives say they want to subsidize more big productions from the german capital in the future . at present , regional film and theater projects are the main beneficiaries of subsidies paid for by german taxes .
the spd says redistribution favoring larger and more expensive productions in berlin would leave many smaller projects without funding . " it makes me a bit worried that only mainstream productions would qualify , " griefahn said .
" in other words , the operas , plays and films that attract large audiences would continue to get publicity , because they can almost support themselves , or at least attract sponsoring . " either way , germany 's film industry , theaters and art community certainly have a vested interest in the outcome of the upcoming election . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de culture galore in the cold war capital while berlin was cut off from the rest of west germany during the cold war , bonn was the german capital .

dw-world talked to her about germany 's state of affairs , the upcoming elections and the country 's future . barcomi came to berlin as a dancer 20 years ago , but decided she 'd rather roast coffee beans a few years later .
" i was tired of people saying that america has no culture , " she said and began baking cookies , cakes and muffins and hand-made bagels to convince berliners otherwise .
a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .
there 's also the theory that people still have a complex about world war ii .
but most countries do n't have a clean slate and are still able to go on and have a health country . gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i have always prided myself in being a democrat .
but if i were german and allowed to vote , i would find it very difficult to re-elect schröder .
i do n't feel that he can make the economic changes needed to get the country back in gear .
but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .
what do you like about germa n y ? i do like that people do n't fall through the grid here .
i think it 's less commercial than the us .
the mentality here was difficult for me to understand at first , there 's a kind of neutrality that americans do no have .
people are more grounded here .
i feel like you do n't have huge discrepancy between those who have and those who have not .
i appreciate that i can have my kids take the subway and ride on busses .
what do you dislike about germa n y ? i think they could use better weather in the summertime .
i definitely had a phase when i was more anti-german , but by and large i do really like germany .
i just feel like people here always want to stay on the safe side .
i have gotten much less risky here . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .

he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .

he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.08.2005 interfaith thinkers debate integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25 million muslims call europe their home scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism . europe is home to some 25 million muslims , accounting for 5.5 percent of the overall population .
since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .

there 's no consumer enthusiasm .

but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .
what do you like about germa n y ? i do like that people do n't fall through the grid here .
i think it 's less commercial than the us .
the mentality here was difficult for me to understand at first , there 's a kind of neutrality that americans do no have .
people are more grounded here .
i feel like you do n't have huge discrepancy between those who have and those who have not .
i appreciate that i can have my kids take the subway and ride on busses .
what do you dislike about germa n y ? i think they could use better weather in the summertime .

dw-world talked to her about germany 's state of affairs , the upcoming elections and the country 's future . barcomi came to berlin as a dancer 20 years ago , but decided she 'd rather roast coffee beans a few years later .
" i was tired of people saying that america has no culture , " she said and began baking cookies , cakes and muffins and hand-made bagels to convince berliners otherwise .
a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .
there 's also the theory that people still have a complex about world war ii .
but most countries do n't have a clean slate and are still able to go on and have a health country . gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i have always prided myself in being a democrat .
but if i were german and allowed to vote , i would find it very difficult to re-elect schröder .
i do n't feel that he can make the economic changes needed to get the country back in gear .
but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .
what do you like about germa n y ? i do like that people do n't fall through the grid here .
i think it 's less commercial than the us .
the mentality here was difficult for me to understand at first , there 's a kind of neutrality that americans do no have .
people are more grounded here .
i feel like you do n't have huge discrepancy between those who have and those who have not .
i appreciate that i can have my kids take the subway and ride on busses .
what do you dislike about germa n y ? i think they could use better weather in the summertime .
i definitely had a phase when i was more anti-german , but by and large i do really like germany .
i just feel like people here always want to stay on the safe side .
i have gotten much less risky here . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?
and then lay it out to berlin and ask if they can deliver . john kluempers interviewed jackson janes send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .

dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .

what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .

it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .

" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .

it does n't often excite much interest abroad , and that 's why the conservatives say they want to subsidize more big productions from the german capital in the future . at present , regional film and theater projects are the main beneficiaries of subsidies paid for by german taxes .
the spd says redistribution favoring larger and more expensive productions in berlin would leave many smaller projects without funding . " it makes me a bit worried that only mainstream productions would qualify , " griefahn said .
" in other words , the operas , plays and films that attract large audiences would continue to get publicity , because they can almost support themselves , or at least attract sponsoring .

politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ? the election campaign might be gathering momentum , but chancellor gerhard schröder still had time to host a book launch in early august .
" art in the chancellery , " an illustrated volume about the work adorning germany 's center of power , is the sort of glossy tome one might find on a coffee table .
it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .
and he hopes they 'll return the favor . ce n tralizi n g the arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cinema for peace " benefit dinner in berlin , 2004 but the opposition conservatives take the chancellor 's demonstrative appreciation of the arts with a pinch of salt . " i do n't think images of the chancellor with artists and writers say anything about how cultivated he is , " said günter nooke , cdu spokesman for cultural affairs .
" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .
" that makes it the most substantial and , spread over the network of the federal republic of germany , the most extensive model for theater production in the world .
it 's an established and unique system .
and if a ministerial post turns this federal system into a centralized one , i think that 's very dangerous for germany 's cultural landscape . " it 's a view shared by much of the country 's arts establishment .
any politician wanting to tamper with the existing subsidy system after the elections and manage the arts from berlin would inevitably face stiff opposition from many artists and from germany 's federal states . skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder , in the bundeskunsthalle in bonn in front of the sculpture " greetings from oslo " by the artist georg baselitz , right .

politicians rediscovering their love for the arts during an election campaign makes them suspicious . " in the current election campaign , the parties are looking for niches where they can still mobilize potential voters , " reinig said .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?
and then lay it out to berlin and ask if they can deliver . john kluempers interviewed jackson janes send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?

politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ? the election campaign might be gathering momentum , but chancellor gerhard schröder still had time to host a book launch in early august .
" art in the chancellery , " an illustrated volume about the work adorning germany 's center of power , is the sort of glossy tome one might find on a coffee table .
it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .
and he hopes they 'll return the favor . ce n tralizi n g the arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cinema for peace " benefit dinner in berlin , 2004 but the opposition conservatives take the chancellor 's demonstrative appreciation of the arts with a pinch of salt . " i do n't think images of the chancellor with artists and writers say anything about how cultivated he is , " said günter nooke , cdu spokesman for cultural affairs .
" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .
" that makes it the most substantial and , spread over the network of the federal republic of germany , the most extensive model for theater production in the world .
it 's an established and unique system .
and if a ministerial post turns this federal system into a centralized one , i think that 's very dangerous for germany 's cultural landscape . " it 's a view shared by much of the country 's arts establishment .
any politician wanting to tamper with the existing subsidy system after the elections and manage the arts from berlin would inevitably face stiff opposition from many artists and from germany 's federal states . skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder , in the bundeskunsthalle in bonn in front of the sculpture " greetings from oslo " by the artist georg baselitz , right .
in general , most of the artists themselves view the politicking with skepticism .
politicians rediscovering their love for the arts during an election campaign makes them suspicious . " in the current election campaign , the parties are looking for niches where they can still mobilize potential voters , " reinig said .
" we know turnout will be very low , so of course they 're looking everywhere they can .
but paying lip service is n't enough for me .
we should be talking about translating words into action . " take german cinema .
it does n't often excite much interest abroad , and that 's why the conservatives say they want to subsidize more big productions from the german capital in the future . at present , regional film and theater projects are the main beneficiaries of subsidies paid for by german taxes .
the spd says redistribution favoring larger and more expensive productions in berlin would leave many smaller projects without funding . " it makes me a bit worried that only mainstream productions would qualify , " griefahn said .
" in other words , the operas , plays and films that attract large audiences would continue to get publicity , because they can almost support themselves , or at least attract sponsoring . " either way , germany 's film industry , theaters and art community certainly have a vested interest in the outcome of the upcoming election . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de culture galore in the cold war capital while berlin was cut off from the rest of west germany during the cold war , bonn was the german capital .

when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .

what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "

that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .

let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .

this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .

a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .
there 's also the theory that people still have a complex about world war ii .
but most countries do n't have a clean slate and are still able to go on and have a health country . gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ? i have always prided myself in being a democrat .
but if i were german and allowed to vote , i would find it very difficult to re-elect schröder .
i do n't feel that he can make the economic changes needed to get the country back in gear .
but i do n't know if that means voting for merkel .
what do you like about germa n y ? i do like that people do n't fall through the grid here .
i think it 's less commercial than the us .
the mentality here was difficult for me to understand at first , there 's a kind of neutrality that americans do no have .
people are more grounded here .
i feel like you do n't have huge discrepancy between those who have and those who have not .
i appreciate that i can have my kids take the subway and ride on busses .
what do you dislike about germa n y ? i think they could use better weather in the summertime .
i definitely had a phase when i was more anti-german , but by and large i do really like germany .
i just feel like people here always want to stay on the safe side .
i have gotten much less risky here . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel speaks out on taxes , iraq revealing more details of what she would do if elected german chancellor in september , conservative leader angela merkel pledged not to send troops to iraq , and defended her plan to raise taxes .

18 is bound to shape future us-german relations .
dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .
he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?
what can we expect ?
where are the policy parameters ?
and then lay it out to berlin and ask if they can deliver . john kluempers interviewed jackson janes send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

dw-world talked to jackson janes , an expert on transatlantic ties . jackso n ja n es is the executive director of the america n i n stitute for co n temporary germa n studies at joh n s hopki n s u n iversity .

what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .

he has lectured exte n sively o n topics deali n g with germa n y .
dw-world : last weeke n d , preside n t george w. bush said that military optio n s vis-a-vis ira n should n ot be ruled out .
i n his ope n i n g electio n campaig n appeara n ce , cha n cellor gerhard schröder respo n ded to bush by sayi n g that military operatio n s should n ' t be optio n s , poi n ti n g out that " we have already see n that they do n ' t amou n t to a n ythi n g . "
what do you thi n k of the divergi n g opi n io n s ?
jackson janes : that is a formula for real friction in the next few months .
when we talk about this problem , we ca n't say : what are the implications for german or european-us relations without talking about iran itself and its ability to come up with a proposal .
this is a situation that is different than iraq .
we actually know that there are materials available to build nuclear weapons should iran pursue that further than they are now .
the issue to me is what needs to be said to tehran that makes it clear that the eu-3 and the us are on the same page .
therefore , i do n't think chancellor schröder 's comments were helpful because the powers in tehran will have the impression that the west is not unified in the matter .
do you thi n k that it was just campaig n i n g o n schröder 's part ?
it could be .
a lot of germans are concerned about the situation in iraq , let alone about another fire that could start in that region .
there 's clearly a lot of people worried .
the co n servative christia n democrats a n d cha n cellor ca n didate a n gela merkel are still ahead i n the polls headi n g towards the sept .
18 poll .
what be n efits could come if the cdu a n d merkel were to wi n the electio n s ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german military aid , here troops in afghanistan , have helped relax strained relations between berlin and washington i think it depends on the coalition that is formed , whether it be with the free democrats or possibly a grand coalition .
the result is still not yet evident so i ca n't say what kind of a position she would have .
what i can say is that as a person , she would try to find the common denominators with the us that she could lay out immediately .
for example , in the balkans , afghanistan , china or russia .
then she could say , " let 's see how we can deal with these areas . "
a n d turkey 's e n tra n ce i n to the europea n u n io n ?
that 's one area where there will be differences .
but i do n't think that a merkel administration will try to stop the start of negotiations with turkey over ankara 's entrance into the eu .
many people in her party think that talks result de facto in membership .
i do n't think that is the case .
i think negotiations will begin in october but the potential entrance of turkey into the eu will be a long evolutionary process that could take at least 10 years .
as for the us , we have to remember that although washington does favor turkish membership , they do n't have a seat in the eu .
the us does , however , want to see an eu that is expansive , not expanding , to those regions that need help , such as ukraine and what is probably up next , the balkans .
the war o n terror , specifically the iraq war , has drive n a wedge betwee n germa n y a n d the us .
germa n s have see n what has happe n ed to america n allies , i.e. the madrid a n d lo n do n bombi n gs , a n d support schröder 100 perce n t o n his positio n n ot to go to war .
do you thi n k that the us will try to court germa n y more for support ?
let 's put it this way .
i think that it would be a dangerous illusion for the germans to think that because they did not participate in the iraq war , that they have some kind of maginot line that protects them from terrorist attacks .
that said , i have heard that there is a lot of collaboration and cooperation going on between germany and the united states .
when it comes to the fight against terrorism , there is probably a lot more happening than meets the public 's eye .
what seems useful to me is to think in terms of what the capabilities are that germany has in order to root out what we know is a problem within europe and see it as a common threat .
the two sides may be cooperati n g but the n there is the example of the motassadeq trial i n hamburg .
that would have bee n a great opportu n ity for the us to ha n d over the i n formatio n obtai n ed from terrorism suspects they were holdi n g so that germa n prosecutors could have a more solid case ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's refusal to fight in iraq will not protect it from terrorist attacks such as in london according to jackson janes i agree that would have been a great chance .
i unfortunately am not privy to the reasons why the us is holding back information .
this is exactly the kind of situation where security agencies need to have more transparency , and that distrust or mistrust is inappropriate when dealing with such situations if it is going to lead to the conviction of a terrorist suspect .
the whole trial seems to cry out for a more effective way of sharing information .
in europe that has been a problem , but the us , in light of 9/11 and with the various intelligence and security agencies , naturally has this problem too .
both gerhard schröder a n d a n gela merkel would like germa n y to gai n a perma n e n t seat o n the un security cou n cil .
what must germa n y do after the electio n s to wi n us support for this ?
germany has put the cart in front of the horse on this issue .
there 's no question on both sides of the atlantic that the un security council needs to be reformed and that it needs to look like the 21st century and not 1945 .
but the whole un needs drastic reforms , so it would be wiser to tackle the question of security council reform within the framework of general un reform .
what do you thi n k us reactio n s would be if gerhard schröder , a master of the comeback as evide n ced i n 2002 , a n d the spd did ma n age to wi n the sept .
18 electio n ?
if gerhard schröder is re-elected a second time , then the questions here will be : what can we do ?

since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media .

he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .

he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .

nearly a million people from around 200 nations are expected to attend events by the end of the week . cologne 's main train station is a magnet for them .
the city on the rhine river is already swarming with fresh-faced young people carrying bright blue backpacks with the world youth day emblem . a mega event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the train station sits right next to cologne 's cathedral the festival kicked off last night with welcoming festivities .

tens of thousands of pilgrims are expected at different official opening masses in the afternoon . cologne is doing all it can to accommodate the masses .
city officials have set up white tanks at intervals throughout town , where visitors can fill up their water bottles from taps connected to cologne 's main water supply . organizers also have their hands full dolling out millions of pieces of fruit and bread rolls to pilgrims .

" i 'm here to see pope benedict xvi and it 's awesome , " said one young man . almost a million people are expected to attend the sunday mass with pope benedict xvi .
on friday , benedict xvi will also be the first pope to attend a german synagogue . bildunterschrift : pilgrims carrying the world youth day cross a test for the pontifex maximus the public appearances of the 78-year-old naturally shy pope will be closely watched for signs of how he compares with john paul ii , who even in his later years wracked by illness could excite huge crowds . cardinal karl lehmann , the leader of the german bishops ' conference who has known the pope for decades , said benedict would have a different style to his immediate predecessor , but that the pilgrims would not be disappointed . " he has shown in recent weeks that he is carrying out these duties with a surprising lightness of touch and aplomb , " lehmann said on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would he recognize himself ?
the image of the pope drawn on the ground in front of the cologne cathedral the first test of the pope 's ability to charm the crowds comes within minutes of his arrival in germany on thursday with a welcome ceremony at the poller rheinwiesen park following a 15-minute trip down the rhine on a river boat .
tight security security will be tight , with fears heightened by this summer 's terrorist attacks in london , and 4,000 police will be deployed in cologne and the surrounding area . in addition , some 4,000 private security guards will be on duty for the duration of the pope 's four-day sojourn .

" we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland . " angela merkel 's visit , coming after her visit to france , is symbolic , " he said .
" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .

" and she 's got a bad reputation throughout poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.08.2005 poland rejects berlin expellee center großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite differences , kwasniewski -lrb- right -rrb- was happy to see merkel as german conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel met polish leaders in warsaw tuesday , a debate about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin is entering yet another round . the center - a memorial for people displaced during world war ii - is the idea of germany 's league of expellees and enjoys the official support of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , while chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling social democratic coalition and eastern european governments are strictly opposed to it . shortly before angela merkel 's departure for warsaw , the cdu 's spokesman for european affairs , peter hintze , confirmed his party 's support for the berlin center which in his eyes would commemorate the fate of the millions of germans who back in 1945 were driven from formerly german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii . hintze said the center - which is to be housed in a former catholic church in berlin , according to news reports - would remind people of the tragedy that large-scale expulsions entailed , but at the same time would promote reconciliation between germans , poles and other eastern europeans . bildunterschrift : germans arrived from poland as late as 1950 he added that he sees the future center embedded in an all-european network of remembrance and said he hoped that talks on this issue in warsaw between angela merkel and polish leaders would be fruitful . " we believe that it 's a good idea for germany , poland , the czech republic and other european countries to try and come to terms with the history of the 20th century in a joint effort , " he said .
" a center in berlin could contribute to reminding people of the horrors of that century , including the genocides , dictatorships and large-scale expulsions .
angela merkel stands for addressing controversial issues openly , and i think that 's a far better way of achieving progress than simply sweeping such issues under the carpet . " " our attitude is n egative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german refugees but polish president alexander kwasniewski does not intend to give up his opposition to a center against expulsions based in berlin .
he - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators . ahead of his meeting with merkel , kwasnieswki said on polish radio that people should not forget who started the war in the first place . " our attitude to the center for the displaced in berlin is negative , " kwasniewski said while praising merkel 's strong opposition to compensation claims by the displaced . " she takes a very clear position , we can only welcome it , " kwasniewski said . he also stressed the importance of merkel 's visit to poland . " angela merkel 's visit , coming after her visit to france , is symbolic , " he said .
" it shows that the probable future chancellor of the german federal republic considers poland to be a serious partner . " a europea n ce n ter impossible ? kwasniewski acknowledged that it 's important to come to terms with history .
but in his view the issue of expulsions should best be highlighted in a joint european project . german social democratic party member peter glotz argued that this is not possible right now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter glotz " i think that a joint european project is simply unrealistic , " he said .
" what we 've seen from talks in this direction so far is that you can perhaps get the various players at one table , but there 's no common ground as to what such a center should be like and what it should symbolize .
the poles for instance would like to turn such a centre into a general site against war and not push the issue of expulsions into the foreground at all .
in a nutshell , there 've been many talks on the issue , resulting in various protocols and declarations of intent , but there 's been no progress in the matter at all .
time , he concludes , is not yet ripe for such a joint effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach cesary gmyz , who writes for the polish weekly wprost said polish resentments towards the berlin center emanate not least from the fact that erika steinbach , the head of the arch-conservative german league of expellees has pushed the idea so much in recent months . " the problem is that steinbach is behind the idea of the berlin center , " he said .
" and she 's got a bad reputation throughout poland .
she has n't said anything yet on the nature of such a center .
will it come in the form of a museum or a scientific research center , or something else ?
we just do n't know in poland which makes it even more difficult to warm to such an idea . " hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin close to new " center of expulsion " controversial plans to build a memorial center in berlin to the millions of people forced to move during and after world war ii are well advanced , the head of a german expellee association said .

dw-world talked to her about germany 's state of affairs , the upcoming elections and the country 's future . barcomi came to berlin as a dancer 20 years ago , but decided she 'd rather roast coffee beans a few years later .
" i was tired of people saying that america has no culture , " she said and began baking cookies , cakes and muffins and hand-made bagels to convince berliners otherwise .
a mother of three , she now runs a coffee shop in the city 's kreuzberg district and a deli in mitte district , employing 37 people . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ? cynthia barcomi : as an employer and a consumer , i just feel like the economy is so amazingly depressed .
there 's no consumer enthusiasm .
as far as employees go , i am shocked at the work ethic of some people .
i 'm so sick and tired of the advantages of the welfare system being abused .
everybody pays for it , but most are not aware how much they do pay for it . what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ? i feel like it 's a very complex problem .
morale has been down since the introduction of the euro .
businesses really took a dip , but have recovered since .
raising vat is certainly not the answer .
it 's very difficult to change the menu every time something changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.08.2005 interfaith thinkers debate integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 25 million muslims call europe their home scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism . europe is home to some 25 million muslims , accounting for 5.5 percent of the overall population .
since most of these muslims are here to stay , the question of their integration is gaining in importance .
but so far , progress on this front has been sluggish , to say the least . berlin is currently hosting an international conference that looks into ways of improving the integration of muslims into western societies , not least against the background of the recent terrorist attacks in london .
the two-day event which is being organized by germany ’ s liberal democrat-affiliated naumann foundation is seeking to reduce misconceptions that europeans have towards the religious and political objectives of muslims on the continent . a sense of alienation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in europe should not feel isolated particularly europe ’ s younger muslims feel themselves increasingly alienated from the western societies they live in , as they do not want or do not have the opportunity to take an active part in shaping these societies .
more often than not , ongoing seclusion is the result which , in its turn , is believed to be the ideal breeding ground for radical ideas and terrorism . mahmoud gaafar , a spokesperson for the egyptian embassy in berlin , maintains though that current problems are being blown out of proportion by both politicians and the media . " muslims living here are like you , exactly , " gaafar said . " they are law-abiding people .
if we have some extremists among them , that that does n't mean that all of us are the same , " he said . islamic world is itself diverse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the question of muslim integration in europe is gaining in importance bacharuddin jusuf habibie , former president of indonesia , said at the conference that there was no reason to believe that muslims and native westerners should be at loggerheads for all time .
he said both groups should concentrate on their common values , advising europeans to stop thinking about muslims only in the context of the middle east conflict . " people always make this mistake : they consider islam by studying and looking at how the middle east acts , especially the arabs , " habibie said . " but there are different arabs .
the middle eastern problem , the palestine problem , for instance , is not an islamic problem , it 's a problem of character , " he said . accepting western standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is difficult for muslims in germany to feel wanted : otto von lambsdorff count otto lambsdorff , who heads the naumann foundation ’ s board of directors , left no doubt whatsoever that muslims living in europe had to understand that people here would never tolerate actions being done in the name of islam , such as genital mutilation , forced marriages , intolerance towards other religions and vendetta-type killings .
he also called on muslim citizens to accept the separation of state and religion in western societies . lambsdorff criticized that only a small proportion of muslims living in germany were entitled to take part in elections at regional and federal level which made it so much harder for them to feel that their integration was really wanted . unrealistic numbers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite current projections , it is unlikely that muslims will outnumber native europeans in france or germany the conference is also dealing with the prospect of muslims outnumbering native europeans in a few decades from now in countries such as france and germany . but siegfried herzog , who works for the naumann foundation , says such projections are unrealistic . " those are the projections that are based on the so-called dog-tail theory , " herzog said . you 're projecting existing birth rates into the future even though you see that minority birth rates within europe tend to come down in line with the society around them .
making a projection based on present birth rates is not very serious .
this is a scare-mongering tactic that is not going to help us in this debate , " he said . german politicians have called on muslims in germany to reorganize themselves with a view to having a joint political representation rather than a dozen different umbrella organizations .
a single representation , they argued , would put muslims in a better position to make their demands heard . hardy graupner -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " we need new answers " the london bombings have rekindled a debate on radical islam and muslim immigrants in europe .

the two are not only fighting each other , but also the new left party . chancellor gerhard schröder 's opposition to the iraq war helped him the general election in 2002 .
so the standoff over iran 's nuclear program - and president bush saying all options were still on the table - was not going to be allowed to slip by . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder on the campaign trail " together , we europeans must support the negotiating process that we have begun , " the chancellor told a crowd of 8,000 in dresden on monday .
" together we must ensure , even though it may be difficult that this conflict is resolved peacefully .
military options , do n't work .
we have already experienced that and do not wish to experience it again . " no differe n ces o n ira n but the opposition christian democrats appeared unwilling to make iran an election issue .
angela merkel , the christian democrat candidate for chancellor , told tuesday 's edition of an eastern german newspaper , the sächsische zeitu n g , that there was no difference between her party 's position on iran and that of the government . for the start of her campaign in eastern germany , merkel , a pastor 's daughter , choose the medieval town of wittenberg , made famous by martin luther and the reformation . if there was any symbolism in the choice of wittenberg as a venue it was lost on the hecklers , who received a none-to-subtle dig from angela merkel about german unification and free speech . " i am happy that these days one can say what one wants without ending up behind bars , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does not think the turkish flag -lrb- right -rrb- should permanently fly among those of the other eu states she received the most applause for what she had to say about turkey 's desire to join the eu and immigration .
every child in germany , she said , should be able to speak german before it started school .
there was no place in germany for those who preached hatred , and one could not expect the european union to accept turkey as a full member . u n employme n t the mai n issue she also touched on the chronic problem successive german governments have failed resolve : stubbornly high unemployment . " unemployment is far too high everywhere in germany , but it is particular high in the new federal states , in the east , " she said . the jobless rate in eastern germany stands at 18.5 percent and is one reason for the popularity of the newly-founded left party .

edmond stoiber is leader of the bavarian csu , the small sister party to angela merkel 's christian democrats .
just days before her appearance in wittenberg , stoiber infuriated east germans last week by insinuating they were less intelligent than west germans . he then suggested a cut-and-thrust debate with lafontaine , but what many commentators took as an invitation to verbal fisticuffs on television will now probably turn into a sedate , written exchange of views in the columns of a newspaper . mark caldwell -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : merkel aims to win back eastern voters chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .

politicians have always been keen to ingratiate themselves with the arts and culture community .
but are their gestures of support mere posturing - or will they translate into constructive policies ? the election campaign might be gathering momentum , but chancellor gerhard schröder still had time to host a book launch in early august .
" art in the chancellery , " an illustrated volume about the work adorning germany 's center of power , is the sort of glossy tome one might find on a coffee table .
it attests to the government 's sophisticated taste in art and boosts schröder 's reputation as a leader with a healthy appreciation of art 's contribution to society . schröder is well aware that this kind of event is a perfect photo opportunity - a chance to showcase german artists and portray the spd as the party of poets and philosophers .
and he hopes they 'll return the favor . ce n tralizi n g the arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cinema for peace " benefit dinner in berlin , 2004 but the opposition conservatives take the chancellor 's demonstrative appreciation of the arts with a pinch of salt . " i do n't think images of the chancellor with artists and writers say anything about how cultivated he is , " said günter nooke , cdu spokesman for cultural affairs .
" politicians from the cdu and csu know more about the arts , but they do n't have to show off the fact , because it 's just a part of everyday life for them . " but the governing spd has gone a step further , and says it wants to appoint an official federal ministry for cultural affairs . " we have a basic weakness that , for instance , within the eu the arts have no single representative , " said monika griefahn , an spd parliamentarian .
" instead , we have a federal cultural affairs commissioner as well as state representatives .
we want the arts to have a stronger voice . " but gundula reinig from the renaissance-theater berlin has reservations about the idea of centralizing cultural policy . " germany 's cultural system is based on the idea of federalism , " she said .
" that makes it the most substantial and , spread over the network of the federal republic of germany , the most extensive model for theater production in the world .
it 's an established and unique system .
and if a ministerial post turns this federal system into a centralized one , i think that 's very dangerous for germany 's cultural landscape . " it 's a view shared by much of the country 's arts establishment .
any politician wanting to tamper with the existing subsidy system after the elections and manage the arts from berlin would inevitably face stiff opposition from many artists and from germany 's federal states . skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder , in the bundeskunsthalle in bonn in front of the sculpture " greetings from oslo " by the artist georg baselitz , right .
in general , most of the artists themselves view the politicking with skepticism .
politicians rediscovering their love for the arts during an election campaign makes them suspicious . " in the current election campaign , the parties are looking for niches where they can still mobilize potential voters , " reinig said .
" we know turnout will be very low , so of course they 're looking everywhere they can .
but paying lip service is n't enough for me .
we should be talking about translating words into action . " take german cinema .
it does n't often excite much interest abroad , and that 's why the conservatives say they want to subsidize more big productions from the german capital in the future . at present , regional film and theater projects are the main beneficiaries of subsidies paid for by german taxes .
the spd says redistribution favoring larger and more expensive productions in berlin would leave many smaller projects without funding . " it makes me a bit worried that only mainstream productions would qualify , " griefahn said .
" in other words , the operas , plays and films that attract large audiences would continue to get publicity , because they can almost support themselves , or at least attract sponsoring . " either way , germany 's film industry , theaters and art community certainly have a vested interest in the outcome of the upcoming election . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : culture galore in the cold war capital while berlin was cut off from the rest of west germany during the cold war , bonn was the german capital .

there are two bac levels : intermediate - equivalent to gcses , nvq level 2 or btec first or intermediate gnvq ; the advanced bac , equivalent to a-levels .
around 700 began the advanced bac pilot in 2003 but 400 dropped out by out by exam time earlier this year .
it is thought most of those had been studying at further education colleges . "
the fact so many kids have dropped out really is worrying " david reynolds project director keith davies , from the welsh joint education committee -lrb- wjec -rrb- , conceded that the rigours of the course might have come as a surprise for some students but insisted it still had a future .
" the demands were higher than the students first felt i think , " he said .
" they thought this was an easy way of getting 120 ucas points , it has proved not to be the case . "
heledd hayes , of the national union of teachers cymru , said it provided a " broadly based and balanced education " and it was important that it did not fall at the first hurdle .
she said : " we hope that it is just a a hiccup .
we have to consider this seriously and see what can be done but the whole ethos of the welsh bac is too important to be lost " .
professor david reynolds , professor of education at exeter university , said he supported the bac but added the drop-out rate could be a problem .
" i think this is worrying because in education , normally , our pilots are better than the real thing because our pilots have volunteers , our pilots have resources , " he said .
" the fact so many kids have dropped out really is worrying .
i think it tells us the future is going to be difficult to get right . "
pilot continues there are two levels ; the intermediate bac , which is equivalent to gcses , nvq level 2 or btec first or intermediate gnvq , and the advanced bac , which is equivalent to a-levels .
one of the reasons being put forward for the drop-out rate is that universities do not know enough about the qualification , while the amount of academic work has also been cited as a problem .
students have been studying for the welsh bac at 18 centres across wales - seven are school sixth forms , one is a catholic sixth form college and 11 are further education colleges .
the welsh bac aims to broaden post-16 education , and give credits for activities such as community work and work experience , but also for proving they were capable in key skills such as maths , ict , languages and communications .
the pilot will continue in september , with 31 schools and colleges involved .
the assembly government said that it was never meant to be " an ' easy ' qualification " .
" some students may have decided to complete only some of the key skills qualifications and so would not have been formally entered for the bac - this is not a ' failure ' , " it said .
the statement added that one of the main purposes of a pilot scheme was to learn lessons , and it will be looking at ways to " encourage completion " .

" they thought this was an easy way of getting 120 ucas points , it has proved not to be the case . "
heledd hayes , of the national union of teachers cymru , said it provided a " broadly based and balanced education " and it was important that it did not fall at the first hurdle .
she said : " we hope that it is just a a hiccup .
we have to consider this seriously and see what can be done but the whole ethos of the welsh bac is too important to be lost " .
professor david reynolds , professor of education at exeter university , said he supported the bac but added the drop-out rate could be a problem .
" i think this is worrying because in education , normally , our pilots are better than the real thing because our pilots have volunteers , our pilots have resources , " he said .
" the fact so many kids have dropped out really is worrying .
i think it tells us the future is going to be difficult to get right . "
pilot continues there are two levels ; the intermediate bac , which is equivalent to gcses , nvq level 2 or btec first or intermediate gnvq , and the advanced bac , which is equivalent to a-levels .
one of the reasons being put forward for the drop-out rate is that universities do not know enough about the qualification , while the amount of academic work has also been cited as a problem .
students have been studying for the welsh bac at 18 centres across wales - seven are school sixth forms , one is a catholic sixth form college and 11 are further education colleges .
the welsh bac aims to broaden post-16 education , and give credits for activities such as community work and work experience , but also for proving they were capable in key skills such as maths , ict , languages and communications .
the pilot will continue in september , with 31 schools and colleges involved .
the assembly government said that it was never meant to be " an ' easy ' qualification " .
" some students may have decided to complete only some of the key skills qualifications and so would not have been formally entered for the bac - this is not a ' failure ' , " it said .
the statement added that one of the main purposes of a pilot scheme was to learn lessons , and it will be looking at ways to " encourage completion " .

bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh said the cells should help researchers test the effectiveness of new drugs .

our correspondent said the long-term aim of the edinburgh research is for cells to be used to build replacement neural tissue for alzheimer 's and parkinson 's sufferers .

professor austin smith , who led the research at the university of edinburgh , told the bbc : " we 're already talking with the bio-technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies about taking these cells into screening systems for new drugs .

" in terms of the possibility of using the cells for transplantation , that 's a much more difficult and longer term thing and i think there we 're talking more of the five to ten year range . "
however , critics say it is unethical to use human embryos in scientific research .
previous attempts at creating the nerve cells have produced contaminated samples that have not been scientifically useful .
robert meadowcroft , of the parkinson 's disease society , welcomed the news : " the purity of these cells should prove particularly valuable in studying the possibilities for transplantation and replacement of damaged tissue . "
the alzheimer 's society echoed this view , saying that the inability to grow nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells had previously been a major obstacle to progress in this area .
the breakthrough comes three months after scientists at newcastle university announced they had successfully produced a cloned embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells .

it is hoped the newly-created cells will eventually help scientists find new treatments for diseases such as parkinson 's and alzheimer 's .
bbc science correspondent pallab ghosh said the cells should help researchers test the effectiveness of new drugs .
stem cells are " master " cells that can become many kinds of tissue .
nerve stem cells are those which help build the brain and central nervous system .
stem cell milestones 1960s : research begins on stem cells taken from adult tissue 1968 : adult stem cells used to treat immunodeficient patient 1998 : us scientists grow stem cells from human embryos and germ cells , establishing cell lines still in use today 2001 : embryonic stem cell turned into a blood cell 2004 : south korean scientists clone 30 human embryos and develop them over several days 2005 : korean team develops stem cells tailored to match individual patients the university 's dr steven pollard said : " this is incredibly exciting in terms of curing disease .
" we may be able to create the disease in a dish .
if we do that , we 'll be able to better understand the disease and also to test drugs . "
our correspondent said the long-term aim of the edinburgh research is for cells to be used to build replacement neural tissue for alzheimer 's and parkinson 's sufferers .
but he said the more immediate use for the artificially-created cells is to test out the effectiveness of new drugs .
professor austin smith , who led the research at the university of edinburgh , told the bbc : " we 're already talking with the bio-technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies about taking these cells into screening systems for new drugs .
hopefully that will come to pass within two to three years .
" in terms of the possibility of using the cells for transplantation , that 's a much more difficult and longer term thing and i think there we 're talking more of the five to ten year range . "
however , critics say it is unethical to use human embryos in scientific research .
previous attempts at creating the nerve cells have produced contaminated samples that have not been scientifically useful .
robert meadowcroft , of the parkinson 's disease society , welcomed the news : " the purity of these cells should prove particularly valuable in studying the possibilities for transplantation and replacement of damaged tissue . "
the alzheimer 's society echoed this view , saying that the inability to grow nerve cells from human embryonic stem cells had previously been a major obstacle to progress in this area .
the breakthrough comes three months after scientists at newcastle university announced they had successfully produced a cloned embryo using donated eggs and genetic material from stem cells .
it was the first time a human cloned embryo had been created in britain .

the gangs appear to have co-ordinated the fighting using mobile telephones , said guatemala 's interior minister carlos vielmann .
officials said an array of weaponry - including knives , automatic rifles and hand grenades - had been smuggled into the prisons .
some of the inmates were killed by gunshot wounds and hand grenade blasts - others were found with their throats cut .

witnesses saw corpses covered in the trademark tattoos of their gangs .
some bodies were said to have been mutilated .
eight men were also killed in the pavon correctional facility near guatemala city , said the head of the country 's prison service .
the bbc 's paul keller , says the rioting is an ominous warning to the authorities in honduras and el salvador as well as guatemala .

the event reaches its high point on thursday with the arrival of pope benedict xvi .
as many as 800,000 young catholics from around the world will take part in a mass given by the pope on sunday .
the city 's hotels and guesthouses are filled to the brim and some 400,000 pilgrims are being put in private homes in the city and across the rhineland .
they have been coming in by the busload from all over europe - ukraine , poland , romania , france - and by plane from across the world .
cologne is awash with young catholics bearing rucksacks and confused faces .
a force of 27,000 volunteers is helping them to their prearranged accommodation , but it is often chaotic work .
the streets are plastered with posters of the pope , whose first foreign trip is - quite by chance - to his homeland .
the air of abnormality is heightened by a massive security operation in which the police have been sealing up manhole covers and will also close down the airport for the pontiff 's arrival and departure .

but many have found themselves dealing with psychological - as well as physical - trauma .
in the second of a five-part series , bbc news talks to soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- and related symptoms .
macmaster was overwhelmed by scenes of death and injury iraq war trauma : your views steve macmaster ca n't sleep without medication : " if people knew what i was thinking , they would not want to associate with me , " he says .
aaron jones does not feel comfortable without a gun around : " i lived in iraq for almost a year with a gun on me all the time or right next to my bed . "
kathy 's boyfriend - who did not want to be named - had to stop watching the news : " when he sees people going to iraq , or coming home , he can get really upset .
" whatever you say , he 'll find something in it to disagree with .
so we do n't watch the news . "
all three veterans of the us occupation of iraq are having nightmares about what they saw and did there - and they are among tens of thousands of us troops suffering from psychological trauma after coming home .
death on the road sgt macmaster , 42 , is haunted by his memories of commanding a transport unit .
a soldier under sgt macmaster 's command fell asleep at the wheel he was in charge of 40 soldiers driving fuel tankers between nasiriya and baghdad - a day-long trip that " was like a bunch of safe forts with no-man 's-land in the middle and everybody taking potshots at you " .
for the safety of his own troops , he had been ordered not to stop moving .
" at the beginning of the war i was told : ' do n't stop for anybody - if they get in the way , run them over . " '
and he had not been in the country long before he saw a lorry run over a little girl in the road begging for food .
" i had seen dead iraqis before , but they were fighters .
these were people who were getting hit in an innocent way . "
he also saw soldiers under his command suffer horrific injuries .
slideshow : aaron jones ' story one fell asleep driving a fully loaded 16,000kg -lrb- 35,000lb -rrb- fuel truck .
it crashed and rolled over , but the driver survived .
" her face had been smashed in .
i could n't get communications to my helicopters so i decided to take this girl in my humvee and blitzed up to baghdad as fast as possible . "
the stress of the mission started getting to him .
" i could n't sleep or eat .
i had butterflies in my stomach attacking me . "
sgt macmaster 's superior noticed the change and sent him to a psychologist , who sent him on to a military hospital where he was diagnosed with ptsd and depression .
worrying trends a lot of iraq veterans are hearing that diagnosis these days .
a study at the us army 's walter reed hospital in washington , dc , found that up to 17 % of iraq veterans - about one in six - suffered depression , anxiety or ptsd .
i 've heard the same miserable stories time and again and i do n't know what to say - he does n't want to be consoled kathy , veteran 's girlfriend about 425,000 us troops have served in iraq since the invasion in march 2003 , meaning some 70,000 could be experiencing psychological trauma .
some early indicators are worrying .
the divorce rate among us army officers has tripled in the past three years .
the national coalition for homeless veterans says that in 2004 its affiliates helped 67 veterans of iraq or afghanistan - only a year or two into those conflicts .
that set off alarm bells at the charity , since experts say it took traumatised vietnam veterans an average 12-15 years to end up in shelters .
" homeless service providers are deeply concerned about the inevitable rising tide of combat veterans who will soon be requesting their support , " the coalition warned .
the number of veterans coming home from iraq , it added , " is unlike anything the nation has experienced since the end of the vietnam war " .
vet centers - community outreach counselling centres set up by the us department of veterans ' affairs - have seen nearly 19,000 iraq or afghanistan veterans to date , says dr al batres , the head of the va 's readjustment counselling service .
' intrusive and disturbing ' tim beebe , regional director of the new england vet centers , says the numbers are increasing month by month .
ptsd rarely goes away on its own , tim beebe warns and his counsellors say they see the same symptoms over and over again : sleeplessness , anger , irritability , anxiety , depression .
" ptsd can be intrusive - you can be out with your family and suddenly you 're thinking about an event in iraq .
it becomes disturbing to the veteran , difficult to understand , " mr beebe says .
" it 's not something the veteran can will away or adapt to .
and it can be chronic and lifelong if not treated . "
but - although pre- and post-deployment mental health screening is becoming standard in the us military - many veterans do not seek treatment .
some simply have no professional services nearby .
self-reliance aaron jones says many veterans think they can simply " suck it up and drive on " , as the military has taught them to do .
it is the unseen injuries that are worrying the pentagon kathy 's boyfriend - a 14-year army veteran who did two tours in iraq and has known friends who were killed there since he came home - is one of them , she says .
he does n't even talk to his veteran friends about his experiences , she says .
" he told me they have a rule that they do n't talk about it - they go out to have fun , and if they talk about iraq , they do n't have fun , " she says .
" i 'm the only one he talks to .
i 've heard the same miserable stories time and again and i do n't know what to say .
he does n't want to be consoled . "
even some of those who have had help continue to struggle with trauma .
steve macmaster would like to stop taking medication for his condition but fears the consequences .
" i do n't want to go back to the way i was in iraq , where i became reckless and thought the only way to end it was to take a bullet - and started hoping for the bullet . "
on wednesday , bbc news investigates the iraqi experience .

i 've heard the same miserable stories time and again and i do n't know what to say - he does n't want to be consoled kathy , veteran 's girlfriend about 425,000 us troops have served in iraq since the invasion in march 2003 , meaning some 70,000 could be experiencing psychological trauma .
some early indicators are worrying .
the divorce rate among us army officers has tripled in the past three years .
the national coalition for homeless veterans says that in 2004 its affiliates helped 67 veterans of iraq or afghanistan - only a year or two into those conflicts .
that set off alarm bells at the charity , since experts say it took traumatised vietnam veterans an average 12-15 years to end up in shelters .
" homeless service providers are deeply concerned about the inevitable rising tide of combat veterans who will soon be requesting their support , " the coalition warned .
the number of veterans coming home from iraq , it added , " is unlike anything the nation has experienced since the end of the vietnam war " .
vet centers - community outreach counselling centres set up by the us department of veterans ' affairs - have seen nearly 19,000 iraq or afghanistan veterans to date , says dr al batres , the head of the va 's readjustment counselling service .
' intrusive and disturbing ' tim beebe , regional director of the new england vet centers , says the numbers are increasing month by month .
ptsd rarely goes away on its own , tim beebe warns and his counsellors say they see the same symptoms over and over again : sleeplessness , anger , irritability , anxiety , depression .
" ptsd can be intrusive - you can be out with your family and suddenly you 're thinking about an event in iraq .
it becomes disturbing to the veteran , difficult to understand , " mr beebe says .
" it 's not something the veteran can will away or adapt to .
and it can be chronic and lifelong if not treated . "
but - although pre- and post-deployment mental health screening is becoming standard in the us military - many veterans do not seek treatment .
some simply have no professional services nearby .
self-reliance aaron jones says many veterans think they can simply " suck it up and drive on " , as the military has taught them to do .
it is the unseen injuries that are worrying the pentagon kathy 's boyfriend - a 14-year army veteran who did two tours in iraq and has known friends who were killed there since he came home - is one of them , she says .
he does n't even talk to his veteran friends about his experiences , she says .
" he told me they have a rule that they do n't talk about it - they go out to have fun , and if they talk about iraq , they do n't have fun , " she says .
" i 'm the only one he talks to .
i 've heard the same miserable stories time and again and i do n't know what to say .
he does n't want to be consoled . "
even some of those who have had help continue to struggle with trauma .
steve macmaster would like to stop taking medication for his condition but fears the consequences .
" i do n't want to go back to the way i was in iraq , where i became reckless and thought the only way to end it was to take a bullet - and started hoping for the bullet . "
