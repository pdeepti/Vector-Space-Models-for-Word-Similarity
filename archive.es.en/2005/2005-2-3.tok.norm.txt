dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .

things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.02.2005 britain faces resistance to african aid plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain wants to step up the pace in the fight to end african poverty britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .
germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .

brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .

but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .

a million of them flock to cologne 's famous festivities for five days and nights . cologne 's carnival would n't be the same without music from celebrated local band " black fööss . "
jecken , or carnival-goers , sing along - usually drunkenly - in their local bars .
often called the " fifth season , " carnival is a time of wild parties , satirical theater , elaborate parades , hand-made masks and costume balls . it officially starts in early november .
but festivities are low key until the tolle tage - " crazy days " - which kick off with weiberfastnacht - " women 's carnival day " - on thursday .
from the stroke of 11:11 a.m. , women acquire the privilege of cutting off men 's ties without retribution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ready for rose monday : a carnival float depicting us president bush and german opposition leader merkel the festivities and masked balls carry on uninterrupted until monday .
for many who 've partied through the five days , the huge rose monday parade , televised live across the country , is the highlight and the last big bang before lent starts . for the kids families with young children often prefer the parade on sunday , the schull- und veedelszoch - school and neighborhood parade - showcasing floats from carnival groups , sports clubs and schools .
kids ride the floats , tossing candies and flowers into the crowds of bystanders . " the schull- und veedelszoch is a bit more natural , a bit nicer , " said one carnival-goer .
" it 's not so professional , more original . " fifty such local parades traipse through the streets of cologne alone .
one of the biggest , in the city 's ehrenfeld district , attracts around 300,000 people .
many of the locals start building and designing their floats and costumes in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on " ladies ' carnival , " cologne 's women took over the town on thursday while the rest of the country continues without a break , jecken in germany 's catholic regions cast aside their work for five days , provoking the scorn of many an uncomprehending northerner .
apparently , you have to be in the thick of it to learn to appreciate the tradition . " when i first came to cologne as a student i though carnival was terrible , " one man said .
" but then i saw how much fun people had and that really impressed me .
that most people enjoy spending weeks making things and getting ready .
then they 're virtually unapproachable for five days - they 're just full of joy . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating carnival read all about carnival in dw-world 's dossier .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush prepares for the state of the union address in the family theater of the white house on feb .
1 she hailed the iraq election as opening the door to greater international involvement in the country .
president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .
so long as the security situation is as it is , this is not a question of principle , it is a very practical question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers carry the coffin of german soldier killed in afghanistan in 2002 it is also a question of resources .
germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

a million of them flock to cologne 's famous festivities for five days and nights . cologne 's carnival would n't be the same without music from celebrated local band " black fööss . "
jecken , or carnival-goers , sing along - usually drunkenly - in their local bars .
often called the " fifth season , " carnival is a time of wild parties , satirical theater , elaborate parades , hand-made masks and costume balls . it officially starts in early november .
but festivities are low key until the tolle tage - " crazy days " - which kick off with weiberfastnacht - " women 's carnival day " - on thursday .
from the stroke of 11:11 a.m. , women acquire the privilege of cutting off men 's ties without retribution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ready for rose monday : a carnival float depicting us president bush and german opposition leader merkel the festivities and masked balls carry on uninterrupted until monday .
for many who 've partied through the five days , the huge rose monday parade , televised live across the country , is the highlight and the last big bang before lent starts . for the kids families with young children often prefer the parade on sunday , the schull- und veedelszoch - school and neighborhood parade - showcasing floats from carnival groups , sports clubs and schools .
kids ride the floats , tossing candies and flowers into the crowds of bystanders . " the schull- und veedelszoch is a bit more natural , a bit nicer , " said one carnival-goer .
" it 's not so professional , more original . " fifty such local parades traipse through the streets of cologne alone .
one of the biggest , in the city 's ehrenfeld district , attracts around 300,000 people .
many of the locals start building and designing their floats and costumes in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on " ladies ' carnival , " cologne 's women took over the town on thursday while the rest of the country continues without a break , jecken in germany 's catholic regions cast aside their work for five days , provoking the scorn of many an uncomprehending northerner .
apparently , you have to be in the thick of it to learn to appreciate the tradition . " when i first came to cologne as a student i though carnival was terrible , " one man said .
" but then i saw how much fun people had and that really impressed me .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .

at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .

" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german keeper jens lehmann claps hands to supporters after the friendly international soccer match between germany and cameroon in leipzig , germany , wednesday , nov .

a million of them flock to cologne 's famous festivities for five days and nights . cologne 's carnival would n't be the same without music from celebrated local band " black fööss . "
jecken , or carnival-goers , sing along - usually drunkenly - in their local bars .
often called the " fifth season , " carnival is a time of wild parties , satirical theater , elaborate parades , hand-made masks and costume balls . it officially starts in early november .
but festivities are low key until the tolle tage - " crazy days " - which kick off with weiberfastnacht - " women 's carnival day " - on thursday .

for many who 've partied through the five days , the huge rose monday parade , televised live across the country , is the highlight and the last big bang before lent starts . for the kids families with young children often prefer the parade on sunday , the schull- und veedelszoch - school and neighborhood parade - showcasing floats from carnival groups , sports clubs and schools .
kids ride the floats , tossing candies and flowers into the crowds of bystanders . " the schull- und veedelszoch is a bit more natural , a bit nicer , " said one carnival-goer .
" it 's not so professional , more original . " fifty such local parades traipse through the streets of cologne alone .

apparently , you have to be in the thick of it to learn to appreciate the tradition . " when i first came to cologne as a student i though carnival was terrible , " one man said .
" but then i saw how much fun people had and that really impressed me .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush prepares for the state of the union address in the family theater of the white house on feb .
1 she hailed the iraq election as opening the door to greater international involvement in the country .
president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .
so long as the security situation is as it is , this is not a question of principle , it is a very practical question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers carry the coffin of german soldier killed in afghanistan in 2002 it is also a question of resources .
germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush prepares for the state of the union address in the family theater of the white house on feb .
1 she hailed the iraq election as opening the door to greater international involvement in the country .
president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .
so long as the security situation is as it is , this is not a question of principle , it is a very practical question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers carry the coffin of german soldier killed in afghanistan in 2002 it is also a question of resources .
germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.02.2005 britain faces resistance to african aid plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain wants to step up the pace in the fight to end african poverty britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .
germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .

in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

bayern 's kahn will be back in goal for the next friendly against slovenia , according to klinsmann . the germany coach has included bayer leverkusen midfielder paul freier in his squad for the first time since last may but chelsea defender robert huth has a knee injury and was not included .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

bayern 's kahn will be back in goal for the next friendly against slovenia , according to klinsmann . the germany coach has included bayer leverkusen midfielder paul freier in his squad for the first time since last may but chelsea defender robert huth has a knee injury and was not included .
vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm is still out of action and will also miss the game . probable teams : germany : jens lehmann ; andreas hinkel , arne friedrich , christian woerns , christian schulz ; bernd schneider , torsten frings , fabian ernst , bastian schweinsteiger ; kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose argentina : roberto abbondanzieri ; javier zanetti , maximiliano rodriguez , gabriel heinze , juan pablo sorin ; juan roman riquelme , lionel scaloni , esteban cambiasso , pablo aimar ; javier saviola , hernan crespo dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need .

president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .

germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

" the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

bayern 's kahn will be back in goal for the next friendly against slovenia , according to klinsmann . the germany coach has included bayer leverkusen midfielder paul freier in his squad for the first time since last may but chelsea defender robert huth has a knee injury and was not included .
vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm is still out of action and will also miss the game . probable teams : germany : jens lehmann ; andreas hinkel , arne friedrich , christian woerns , christian schulz ; bernd schneider , torsten frings , fabian ernst , bastian schweinsteiger ; kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose argentina : roberto abbondanzieri ; javier zanetti , maximiliano rodriguez , gabriel heinze , juan pablo sorin ; juan roman riquelme , lionel scaloni , esteban cambiasso , pablo aimar ; javier saviola , hernan crespo dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .

germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .

germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 eu outlines new business-friendly vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission head barroso : given up on being top of the world ?
the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .
" those are not part of the problem but part of the solution .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.02.2005 britain faces resistance to african aid plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain wants to step up the pace in the fight to end african poverty britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .
germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .

" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

bayern 's kahn will be back in goal for the next friendly against slovenia , according to klinsmann . the germany coach has included bayer leverkusen midfielder paul freier in his squad for the first time since last may but chelsea defender robert huth has a knee injury and was not included .
vfb stuttgart 's philipp lahm is still out of action and will also miss the game . probable teams : germany : jens lehmann ; andreas hinkel , arne friedrich , christian woerns , christian schulz ; bernd schneider , torsten frings , fabian ernst , bastian schweinsteiger ; kevin kuranyi , miroslav klose argentina : roberto abbondanzieri ; javier zanetti , maximiliano rodriguez , gabriel heinze , juan pablo sorin ; juan roman riquelme , lionel scaloni , esteban cambiasso , pablo aimar ; javier saviola , hernan crespo dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi 's squad dismantles thais the german national soccer team ended its three-game asian tour with an easy 5-1 victory over thailand .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .

a million of them flock to cologne 's famous festivities for five days and nights . cologne 's carnival would n't be the same without music from celebrated local band " black fööss . "
jecken , or carnival-goers , sing along - usually drunkenly - in their local bars .
often called the " fifth season , " carnival is a time of wild parties , satirical theater , elaborate parades , hand-made masks and costume balls . it officially starts in early november .
but festivities are low key until the tolle tage - " crazy days " - which kick off with weiberfastnacht - " women 's carnival day " - on thursday .
from the stroke of 11:11 a.m. , women acquire the privilege of cutting off men 's ties without retribution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ready for rose monday : a carnival float depicting us president bush and german opposition leader merkel the festivities and masked balls carry on uninterrupted until monday .
for many who 've partied through the five days , the huge rose monday parade , televised live across the country , is the highlight and the last big bang before lent starts . for the kids families with young children often prefer the parade on sunday , the schull- und veedelszoch - school and neighborhood parade - showcasing floats from carnival groups , sports clubs and schools .
kids ride the floats , tossing candies and flowers into the crowds of bystanders . " the schull- und veedelszoch is a bit more natural , a bit nicer , " said one carnival-goer .
" it 's not so professional , more original . " fifty such local parades traipse through the streets of cologne alone .
one of the biggest , in the city 's ehrenfeld district , attracts around 300,000 people .
many of the locals start building and designing their floats and costumes in october . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on " ladies ' carnival , " cologne 's women took over the town on thursday while the rest of the country continues without a break , jecken in germany 's catholic regions cast aside their work for five days , provoking the scorn of many an uncomprehending northerner .
apparently , you have to be in the thick of it to learn to appreciate the tradition . " when i first came to cologne as a student i though carnival was terrible , " one man said .
" but then i saw how much fun people had and that really impressed me .
that most people enjoy spending weeks making things and getting ready .
then they 're virtually unapproachable for five days - they 're just full of joy . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating carnival read all about carnival in dw-world 's dossier .

" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .

" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .

8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 eu outlines new business-friendly vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission head barroso : given up on being top of the world ?
the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically .

she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "

dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .

things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .

dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc germany dismisses visas for terrorists the german government dismissed a press report on thursday which claimed it had granted visas to two chechens suspected of involvement in the bloody hostage-taking at a moscow theater in 2002 .
mass-circulation bild newspaper reported that a senior police official had admitted that the men , who are brothers , had been granted visas several times despite warnings from russian authorities .
but a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry said all security precautions had been taken and that neither of the men had shown up in a database of terrorist suspects .
there had been nothing on record to prevent the men from receiving visas , the spokeswoman said .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said this case showed that the immigration authorities had failed to heed security warnings .
germany 's approach to issuing visas through its consulates is currently mired in controversy .
a parliamentary committee began work last month to investigate whether the policy was too lax and could have encouraged people smuggling . dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 eu outlines new business-friendly vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission head barroso : given up on being top of the world ?
the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 eu outlines new business-friendly vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission head barroso : given up on being top of the world ?
the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .
figures show the us spent just 0.15 percent of its gross national income on foreign aid in 2003 , the lowest of the g7 countries . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush prepares for the state of the union address in the family theater of the white house on feb .
1 she hailed the iraq election as opening the door to greater international involvement in the country .
president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .
so long as the security situation is as it is , this is not a question of principle , it is a very practical question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers carry the coffin of german soldier killed in afghanistan in 2002 it is also a question of resources .
germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 .

after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

ja , bitte !
german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

" we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need .

" together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .

germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

" the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .

23 . but her first major diplomatic outing as secretary of state will also enable her to establish better ties with germany , which has , through foreign minister joschka fischer , played an important role in the so-called greater middle east . while he will be in southeast asia during rice 's visit , their talks in washington last week suggest that international efforts to persuade iran to give up its suspected nuclear arms program will be a major topic when rice meets with german chancellor gerhard schröder . in an interview on tuesday , rice said the us appreciated the european effort to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis but did not want to rule out other options . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer -lrb- right -rrb- talking to rice 's predecessor , colin powell , in berlin last april fischer urged closer cooperation between europe and the united states to deal with the danger that a nuclear-armed iran would represent and , in particular , asked washington to become more involved diplomatically . " for us it is important that we do all we can to bring together the positions in an intense dialogue across the atlantic so that we can make diplomatic progress , " he said . " we do n't want an iran with nuclear weapons , " he continued , adding that it could lead to an arms race in one of the most dangerous regions of the world . international cooperation in iraq ? on iraq , rice faces a virtually impossible task in trying to convince germany , one of the major opponents of the war , to play a major role and will certainly not receive any pledge for troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia , " she was quoted as saying in 2003 about the war opponents .
rice has since backed away from the formula and on tuesday predicted a new spirit of international cooperation for iraq but refused to speak of a us exit strategy .
she said the goal was to get iraq up and running quickly and gradually scale back the american presence . " i do n't think we want to talk in terms of exit strategies , " rice said .
" i think we should ask ourselves what can we do now to - as quickly as possible - make the iraqis self-sufficient but also give them the support that they need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush prepares for the state of the union address in the family theater of the white house on feb .
1 she hailed the iraq election as opening the door to greater international involvement in the country .
president george w. bush , boosted by the iraqi election , will use his state of the union speech wednesday to seek global support for iraq , as he lays out top priorities of his second term . germany remains firm germany has stood firm on its iraq policy . " together with its partners germany is ready to further support the political process in iraq , " fischer said .
germany is helping to train iraq 's military outside the country . " our position is clear , " fischer said in brussels on monday .
" while others are talking , we have been giving training , and we will continue to give training .
so long as the security situation is as it is , this is not a question of principle , it is a very practical question . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers carry the coffin of german soldier killed in afghanistan in 2002 it is also a question of resources .
germany has more troops posted abroad on peacekeeping and anti-terror missions than any other country , bar the united states , and any further deployments would probably be opposed in parliament . israel and palestine finally , another of fischer 's prime concerns , the conflict between israel and the palestinians , is also likely to figure high on the agenda of the talks between rice , who will also visit israel and the west bank , and schröder . germany has been perhaps the key european broker in the middle east , with fischer adopting the role of an interlocutor who is respected by all sides . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sizing up us-german relations german foreign minister joschka fischer met us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington late tuesday in the first high level bilateral talks since president bush 's re-election .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .

" these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .
earlier this month , a government investigation found that france 's far-right groups were increasingly targeting muslims rather than jews . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.02.2005 britain faces resistance to african aid plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain wants to step up the pace in the fight to end african poverty britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .
germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 france plans to ban neo-nazi groups großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitic and anti-muslim attacks are on the rise in france french interior minister dominique de villepin on tuesday told lawmakers he would ask the center-right government to back a proposal to break up all neo-nazi groups . " these movements must be dissolved , and i will propose this to the cabinet " in accordance with a january 1936 law that authorizes the disbanding of associations seen as a threat to public order and democracy , de villepin said . the interior minister estimated that some 3,000 people belong to neo-nazi groups across france . " we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .
both communities have been the victims of increasing violence in recent years .
earlier this month , a government investigation found that france 's far-right groups were increasingly targeting muslims rather than jews . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for eu ban on nazi symbols several german lawmakers have called for a europe-wide ban on nazi insignia following widespread outrage after britain 's prince harry wore a swastika as part of a costume at a high-society gathering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.02.2005 britain faces resistance to african aid plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain wants to step up the pace in the fight to end african poverty britain wants to use its g8 leadership to double aid to africa and write off the continent 's debts .
germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .
" discussions continue with japan , canada and the us , who are looking at the options , " a british treasury official told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush commenting on iraqi elections so far , tokyo has shown little enthusiasm for the british proposal , while us president bush is said to be too preoccupied with iraq and a growing budget deficit to dwell on africa .
figures show the us spent just 0.15 percent of its gross national income on foreign aid in 2003 , the lowest of the g7 countries . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

germany and other european countries are backing the plan , but the us and japan are proving hard to convince . british finance minister gordon brown , who toured africa last month , wants to use a year-long leadership of the group of eight rich nations to secure commitments to pull africa out of disease and poverty and ensure that the un goal of halving world poverty by 2015 is met .
brown is expected to address the issue when he hosts talks with industrial and emerging market nations later this week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british finance minister gordon brown , right , with prime minister tony blair with the support of prime minister tony blair , brown is advocating an international finance facility -lrb- iff -rrb- in which g8 countries would pay up to an additional $ 100 billion -lrb- € 77 billion -rrb- a year in development assistance between now and 2015 .
g8 countries would pay into the fund by issuing bonds using long-term commitments as collateral .
britain has already pledged an extra $ 188.5 million a year to write off the debts of some 30 poor countries to the world bank and the african development bank .
brown now wants other rich countries to follow suit .
he has also proposed writing off multilateral debt of the poorest nations using money raised by revaluing the international monetary fund 's gold reserves at its current market price .
in return , poor nations would promise to step up the fight against corruption and thus ensure that the increased development aid would be used better .
germany welcomes plan european countries have largely welcomed britain 's proposals to help alleviate third world poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said last week that in the face of the dramatic rise in aids in africa , industrial nations had to provide support that was " permanent and sustainable . "
wieczorek-zeul pointed out that increased financial aid to fight poverty would " really contribute " towards protecting more people from aids and offering them a new perspective .
in an interview with british newspaper the guardian , wieczorek-zeul called the british proposal " worth supporting " and said rich industrial nations had to increase their development aid budgets .
at the same time wieczorek-zeul pointed out that debt relief could n't be the only answer to solve african problems .
" the decisive motor for development is free trade , " the minister said , adding that subsidies for european and american products had to be dismantled in order to give african goods a fair chance .
doubts remain other european nations including france and italy have also signed up to britain 's proposal of writing off third-world debt .
however , doubts still persist .
paris is reportedly worried that governments with budget deficits will end up supporting other long-term projects so as to repay the billions borrowed .
" the iff is a major lever but how do you pay the money back ? " one french official told reuters .
" if it 's from national budgets that stops flows of new money -lrb- in aid to africa -rrb- , or else it 's revenues from an international tax . "
france wants london and others to back president jacques chirac 's proposal for an international tax on financial transactions or items such as airline tickets to ensure funding to fight aids and for long-term development aid .
us and japan tough to convince but the tougher task for britain will be convincing rich nations such beyond europe to come on board .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 03.02.2005 dry spell for german beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does german beer have an image problem ?
dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .
consumers wo n't notice a difference as neither berliner kindl nor brinkhoff 's beer will disappear from the market . dr. oetker spent years developing its beer division , which finally culminated in the 2004 acquisition of dortmund beverage company brau und brunnen catapulting it to number one in the national beer industry .
along with radeberger and jever , rb braunholding also owns schöfferhofer weizen , clausthaler non-alcoholic beer and sion kölsch . consumption declining bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are drinking less beer than in the past germany has around 1,260 breweries , but they 've been serving ever less brew to their countrymen and women for decades .
in 1976 , each german drank an average of 156 liters -lrb- 41 gallons -rrb- - 23 percent of their entire individual beverage consumption .
brewers saw those levels as immutable , without realizing that lifestyles change , according to beverage sector analyst rudolf böhlke from the consultancy ernst & young .
things have been going downhill since .
in 2003 , germans drank 118 liters per capita , the german brewers ' association reported . " german beer has an image problem , " said böhlke .
" beer has the image of being a thirst-quencher and not a luxury article like wine . " though germany 's stringent german purity law guarantees that all beer made here is high quality , there 's no way to really distinguish between brands as there is with wine .
whether in glass or plastic bottles , the quality of the beer itself remains the same . cultural value ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of german culture the future looks brighter for breweries in guesthouses that produce smaller amounts of beer . " they have a good image and do n't need to cart their beer far , " said uwe witt of the ngg food , hotel and restaurant trade union .
but mid-sized breweries will likely have a tough time , he added .
their capacities are too high to merely serve the regional market , while they are n't big enough to become national players . besides , international companies like heineken , interbrew and carlsberg , active on the german market , have upped the ante in terms of competition . even if trends are moving towards alcohol-free and mixed drinks , beer does have one thing going for it , böhnke said : it 's part of german culture and germans have a strong emotional bond to their national beverage . verena wolff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beer at the world cup ?

dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery . dr. oetker 's beer division , rb brauholding , plans to restructure , slashing up to 450 jobs . " the declining beer market and substantial overcapacities make cuts unavoidable , " according to rb brauholding head ulrich kallmeyer . beer production will be concentrated at the dab and schultheiss breweries in dortmund and berlin instead of running two large breweries at each location , which kallmeyer were currently only operating at half capacity .
dr. oetker plans to invest € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in dab and schultheiss over the next 12 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.02.2005 eu outlines new business-friendly vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission head barroso : given up on being top of the world ?
the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .

the european union executive wednesday outlined a new long-term plan for economic revival which , in a break with the past , puts the focus squarely on deregulation and business-friendly policies . the plan , while urging eu governments to accelerate reforms to their labor markets and to cut red tape , ditches the eu 's long-stated ambition of forging the " world 's most dynamic economy " by 2010 .
the report marks the mid-way review of the eu 's five-year-old " lisbon strategy " of reform , launched amid much fanfare in the portuguese capital with the goal of overtaking the united states in the competitiveness stakes . " the central message of the last five years is that europe must refocus if it is to refuel its flagging economic engine , " european commission president jose barroso told a news conference .
after the eu 's achievements in forging a single market , a common currency and last year 's addition of 10 more member states , he said the drive to slash unemployment through higher growth " is europe 's next great project . " the new-look lisbon strategy will be presented to eu leaders at a march summit where , diplomats believe , it will win strong approval .
the 2010 target is no longer mentioned in the report , giving formal recognition to the widespread view that owing to years of economic slowdown and a lack of reformist zeal , the eu is nowhere near ready to meet the goal . eu too far behind but barroso , who was in the vanguard of europe 's free-marketeers during his time as portugal 's prime minister , made clear that reforms could no longer be put off .
he said the eu was now averaging economic growth of just 2 percent , compared to 3.5 percent in the united states , while china and india are marking " huge strides " at a time that the eu 's populations are ageing rapidly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection against poverty " a job is the best weapon against poverty , " he added , on the day that new figures confirmed unemployment in germany is now at its highest level since the 1930s . but barroso also sought to assuage the fears of left-wingers and environmentalists who fear he wants to take the eu down the road to a us-style , freewheeling capitalism with minimal safeguards and rampant poverty . " it is as if i have three children - the economy , our social agenda , and the environment , " he said , explaining that all deserved equal love . action plan the report recommended a range of action : pensions and healthcare systems must be modernized to cope with the ageing societies .
billions more euros should be pumped into research and development -lrb- r and d -rrb- .
europe should create its own elite academy along the lines of the world-famous massachusetts institute of technology .
business must be freed from onerous regulation .
the eu 's internal market should be completed with long overdue deregulation of the telecommunications , energy and transport sectors .
government aid for companies should be channeled into nimble start-ups rather than national champions to support the r and d goal .
the eu should appoint an economic reform overseer - dubbed " mr. or ms. lisbon . "
the commission 's plan would appear to mark a radical break with a past in which brussels was caricatured as a busybody keen to spread its reach into every facet of life in eu countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former danish prime minister poul nyrup rasmussen it received a warm welcome from european conservatives and a qualified one from liberals , but was met with hostility by the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- .
left-wingers accused the commission of ditching europe 's " social model " of consensual politics and ignoring the ability of scandinavian nations to stay competitive despite their high welfare costs . " we have , in the most successful economies in europe , proven that the right and modern framework for growth and competitiveness does include social and environmental policies , " said pes president poul nyrup rasmussen -lrb- above -rrb- , a former danish prime minister .

" we will see to it that these groups are not reconstructed under false names , " de villepin added , calling the movements " a threat and a danger , especially when we know their activities are more and more violent . " the minister said neo-nazi groups were responsible for 65 acts of violence in 2004 , as compared with just 27 such acts in 2003 . de villepin , the government 's point man on law and order , said he would crack down on the spread of neo-nazi ideas via the internet , and ask mayors and regional officials to help prevent public meetings of neo-nazi groups . alsace , in eastern france along the german border , is one of the country 's neo-nazi strongholds , where the extreme right-wing party front national also does well .
the groups operate there surreptitiously , organizing meetings under the guise of friendly soccer matches , for example , where the tone changes once the players retire to bars for some after-sport refreshment . mayors scared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spreading fear local authorities are almost powerless to stop the neo-nazi gatherings .
renting out meeting rooms is a private affair that officials ca n't simply ban .
many mayors are too afraid of the consequences if they took aggressive measures against the sometimes large groups of neo-nazis that meet in their small towns and villages . " ' if we chase them away , there 'll be a brawl and then it 'll be difficult , ' says the mayor who fears the neo-nazis will terrorize his village , " according to mayor gilbert reutenauer in hinsbourg , where around 800 of them held a gathering in october 2003 . some are skeptical that the interior minister 's plans will make a difference at all since it 's hard to identify the culprits in the first place . " they do n't show pictures of hitler , or anything that recalls the past , " said rene monzat , an expert on the right-wing extremist scene .
" the minister 's push is welcome but it remains symbolic . " europe 's largest muslim and jewish populations live in france .

jürgen klinsmann is determined to break the curse sooner rather than later .
argentina visit on wednesday and klinsi believes the moment has come . although the klinsmann era has been , on the whole , a successful one so far , the german national soccer coach has one statistic he would like to put right while his tenure is still in its infancy .
germany must end their four-year winless streak against the world 's top teams . klinsmann will be looking to right that particular wrong when his team host argentina in a friendly on wednesday in düsseldorf .
the former germany striker and world cup winner has pin-pointed the match against the twice-crowned world champions from south america as the one in which his young squad can overcome a major soccer power for the first time since dietmar hamann 's free-kick landed germany a 1-0 victory over england in 2000 . " it 's time to bring this negative series to an end , " said klinsmann , whose are on a run of five wins , a draw against brazil and one defeat by south korea since he took over from rudi völler in august 2004 .
" argentina will be the first highlight of the year for us and our goal is quite clear : we have n't beaten a great football country since the 1-0 win over england on october 7 , 2000 . " dismal run to 2002 world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo puts the finishing touches to brazil 's world cup final win over germany in 2002 .
after the victory at wembley , germany embarked on a dismal run ahead of the 2002 world cup in japan / korea .
germany lost 1-0 to france , were thrashed 5-1 at home in the re-match with england and 1-0 to argentina .
at the world cup , germany beat paraguay , the united states and south korea before losing 2-0 in the final to a ronaldo-inspired brazil . they have since lost 3-1 to the netherlands , 3-1 to spain , 1-0 to italy and 3-0 to france .
they at least put the breaks on the bad run against top teams when a spirited performance against brazil was rewarded with a 1-1 draw in september . they will have at least three more chances to set the record straight by the end of the year .
they play argentina , and possibly brazil again , in the confederations cup and there are further friendly internationals to come against the netherlands and france .
" this year has a lot of highlights and it 's going to teach us a lot , " klinsmann said .
" we need such big games ahead of the world cup .
they 're very instructive . " coach keeps faith in asia tour squad klinsmann continues to overhaul the germany team and stamp his authority on it .
to beat one of the major soccer powers for the first time in over four years would be a major coup for the coach who has ruffled more than his fair share of feathers at the top of the game since taking on the role last year . he has resisted the urge to shuffle his pack for wednesday 's friendly , sticking on the whole to those players who featured on the recent trip to asia . however , german captain michael ballack will not take any part in the match on wednesday evening . the bayern munich midfielder was feeling the effects of a cold when he joined up with the squad on tuesday and klinsmann ruled him out of the argentina match .
" ballack has gone back to munich , " klinsmann said .
" he played in a similar condition against brazil and it only made things worse .

european politicians like the soothing words on iran they heard in president george w. bush 's state of the union address on wednesday .
but in other areas , the two sides remain far apart . the sentence european diplomats were waiting for came two-thirds of the way into bush 's speech .
" we are working with our european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program , " he told congressional members and guests during wednesday night 's speech .
the statement and bush 's stated effort to emphasize building coalitions in his second term at least temporarily smoothed feathers ruffled by washington 's hardline stance on iran .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose hans-ulrich klose -lrb- photo -rrb- , the social democratic party 's foreign policy expert , said the speech was encouraging .
" the president ... expressly mentioned the willingness to cooperate , and that 's a good foundation , " he said .
visits bode well rice 's visit to berlin on feb .
8 , and bush 's meeting with eu leaders and with chancellor gerhard schröder in mainz at the end of the month , is being seen as more evidence that the unilateral attitude that marked bush 's first term might be mellowing .
" i 'm sure that we 'll be able to build a solid foundation with the new administration , " said jose barroso , the president of the european commission , in a recent press conference .
for all the hope , there are some marked differences in the way the eu and the us intend to approach several foreign policy tangles .
looming flashpoints : syria , china whereas the european union favors cooperation agreements and diplomacy in dealing with syria , washington 's rhetoric is more aggressive .
in his speech , bush mentioned the syrian accountability act , passed by congress , which will press syria into flushing out terrorists " who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu favors lifting arms embargos on china in china , the eu - dazzled by the world 's biggest market - has gone on a friendly course , offering to lift its arms embargo .
the us sees the move as potentially dangerous for taiwan , which still enjoys america 's support against a chinese takeover .
the eu is also interested in normalizing its relations with cuba , something washington is strictly against .
and in sudan , the european union looks willing to support a recent united nations report that does n't call the humanitarian crisis in the central african country genocide , but recommends filing a suit before the international court in the hague .
america , which wants the attacks carried out by arab militias on the region 's black population called genocide , does n't recognize the court .
seeds of hope common ground is seen in the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
bush praised new palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas ' coming meeting with israeli leader ariel sharon in egypt .
" there is a moment of peace that we need to use , " said javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief on monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian lawmakers take a look at the construction site of one of the country 's uranian conversion facilities politicians hope that the spirit of dialogue and diplomacy in the israel-palestinian conflict will extend to iran .
" i think america has realized that although they may be able to still win a war alone , they ca n't win the peace and that the problems in this world are so large that one needs partners , " said volker rühe , chairman of the parliamentary foreign relations committee . nina werkhäuser / bernd riegert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

a million of them flock to cologne 's famous festivities for five days and nights . cologne 's carnival would n't be the same without music from celebrated local band " black fööss . "
jecken , or carnival-goers , sing along - usually drunkenly - in their local bars .
often called the " fifth season , " carnival is a time of wild parties , satirical theater , elaborate parades , hand-made masks and costume balls . it officially starts in early november .
but festivities are low key until the tolle tage - " crazy days " - which kick off with weiberfastnacht - " women 's carnival day " - on thursday .
from the stroke of 11:11 a.m. , women acquire the privilege of cutting off men 's ties without retribution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting ready for rose monday : a carnival float depicting us president bush and german opposition leader merkel the festivities and masked balls carry on uninterrupted until monday .
for many who 've partied through the five days , the huge rose monday parade , televised live across the country , is the highlight and the last big bang before lent starts . for the kids families with young children often prefer the parade on sunday , the schull- und veedelszoch - school and neighborhood parade - showcasing floats from carnival groups , sports clubs and schools .
kids ride the floats , tossing candies and flowers into the crowds of bystanders . " the schull- und veedelszoch is a bit more natural , a bit nicer , " said one carnival-goer .

the web-based register , launched last month , was developed by the department for education and skills as a way of clamping down on bogus colleges .
but some students have also been refused visas because genuine centres ' addresses were not all listed .
the register provides a way for students to check if an institution they are interested in is genuine . "
it can damage the reputation of the institution " duncan lane council for international education it also allows immigration staff in the uk and abroad to check whether someone seeking a visa is going to a bona fide college .
and the list includes diverse institutions such as a coffee bar in nottingham , holloway jail and even the archbishop of canterbury .
' refused extension ' one particular problem arose with institutions which have multiple campuses .
the recently renamed university of the arts london , for example - famous alumni including stella mccartney , sir terence conran , john hurt and antony gormley - has some 18 constituent parts .
one of its students was refused an extension of permission to stay because not every address was on the register , said duncan lane , director of advice and training at the council for international education -lrb- ukcosa -rrb- , which looks after students ' interests .
the university was alerted and quickly corrected the error .
but an overseas student thinking of applying to an institution in a similar position might have concluded it was not genuine and looked elsewhere .
" it can damage the reputation of the institution , " he said , " so they are very sensitive to that . "
" this has happened a few times that we know of . "
' surprise ' universities uk - representing the bigger institutions - said it would continue working with all involved " to resolve any outstanding issues " .
but the other side of the coin is that some institutions are listed which on the face of it have no connection with foreign students - such as the unique coffee bar in nottingham .
" it 's a surprise to us , " said its development manager , gemma thorpe .
the reason is that the register was compiled using lists of training organisations provided by funding organisations - which is how prisons come to be on it , for example .
the coffee house is also an alternative education provider , working with youngsters who are not getting on in mainstream schools .
" we have not had any foreign students , " ms thorpe said - and nor is she looking for any .
replacement register ukcosa 's duncan lane said : " on the face of it , it does n't cause any harm because that coffee shop is n't going to abuse its position and say , great , let 's make loads of money and recruit students from china . "
he thinks probably it is just a question of teething troubles .
" we could be making a lot of noise about something that 's just a bit quirky . "
but if such organisations which are on the register were taken over by underworld gangs in some of the countries that export " students " to the uk for other purposes , there could be a problem , he said .
the dfes said the issue of organisations with constituent parts had now been addressed .
it and the e-learning organisation ufi were compiling a new register of learning providers which would have a much broader purpose .
" individual learners and employers will be able to find out about the learning provision available in the uk and the quality of that provision , " a spokesperson said .
an initial version will be operating by the end of this year , with a full register in place by autumn 2007 .
and the reason for the inclusion of the archbishop of canterbury ?
" listed by virtue of degree-awarding powers granted by the pope in 1533 , " according to the times higher education supplement , which has been investigating the register .

our generation has been blessed - by the expansion of opportunity , by advances in medicine , and by the security purchased by our parents ' sacrifice .
now , as we see a little grey in the mirror - or a lot of grey - and we watch our children moving into adulthood , we ask the question : what will be the state of their union ?
the economy america 's economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialised nation .
in the past four years , we have provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes , overcome a recession , opened up new markets abroad , prosecuted corporate criminals , raised homeownership to the highest level in history , and in the last year alone , the united states has added 2.3 million new jobs ...
now we must add to these achievements .
by making our economy more flexible , more innovative , and more competitive , we will keep america the economic leader of the world .
social security one of america 's most important institutions - a symbol of the trust between generations - is also in need of wise and effective reform .
social security was a great moral success of the 20th century , and we must honour its great purposes in this new century .
the system , however , on its current path , is headed toward bankruptcy ...
if you 've got children in their 20s , as some of us do , the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter ...
we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all .
marriage because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society , it should not be re-defined by activist judges .
for the good of families , children , and society , i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage .
medical research to build a culture of life , we must ... ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity , not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others ...
america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious , aggressive , and always ethical .
war on terror we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy - and chief among them is freedom from fear ...
our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many , and intimidate us all - and we will stay on the offensive against them , until the fight is won .
spreading democracy the united states has no right , no desire , and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else .
that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies .
they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression , in which a tiny group of brutal , self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life .
our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations , with governments that answer to their citizens , and reflect their own cultures .
and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbours , the advance of freedom will lead to peace .
middle east the goal of two democratic states , israel and palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach - and america will help them achieve that goal .
to promote peace in the broader middle east , we must confront regimes that continue to harbour terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder .
syria still allows its territory , and parts of lebanon , to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region .
iran today , iran remains the world 's primary state sponsor of terror - pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve ...
to the iranian people , i say tonight : as you stand for your own liberty , america stands with you .
iraq our generational commitment to the advance of freedom , especially in the middle east , is now being tested and honoured in iraq .
that country is a vital front in the war on terror , which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there ...
we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty - as they showed the world last sunday .
the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy , and will continue to attack it .
yet the terrorists ' most powerful myth is being destroyed ...
and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people .
' biggest dreams ' as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans , " each age is a dream that is dying , or one that is coming to birth " .
and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born .
the abolition of slavery was only a dream - until it was fulfilled .
the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream - until it was achieved .
the fall of imperial communism was only a dream - until , one day , it was accomplished .
our generation has dreams of its own , and we also go forward with confidence .
the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable - yet we know where it leads : it leads to freedom .

social security one of america 's most important institutions - a symbol of the trust between generations - is also in need of wise and effective reform .
social security was a great moral success of the 20th century , and we must honour its great purposes in this new century .
the system , however , on its current path , is headed toward bankruptcy ...
if you 've got children in their 20s , as some of us do , the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter ...
we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all .
marriage because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society , it should not be re-defined by activist judges .
for the good of families , children , and society , i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage .
medical research to build a culture of life , we must ... ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity , not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others ...
america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious , aggressive , and always ethical .
war on terror we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy - and chief among them is freedom from fear ...
our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many , and intimidate us all - and we will stay on the offensive against them , until the fight is won .
spreading democracy the united states has no right , no desire , and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else .
that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies .
they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression , in which a tiny group of brutal , self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life .
our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations , with governments that answer to their citizens , and reflect their own cultures .
and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbours , the advance of freedom will lead to peace .
middle east the goal of two democratic states , israel and palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach - and america will help them achieve that goal .
to promote peace in the broader middle east , we must confront regimes that continue to harbour terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder .
syria still allows its territory , and parts of lebanon , to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region .
iran today , iran remains the world 's primary state sponsor of terror - pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve ...
to the iranian people , i say tonight : as you stand for your own liberty , america stands with you .
iraq our generational commitment to the advance of freedom , especially in the middle east , is now being tested and honoured in iraq .
that country is a vital front in the war on terror , which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there ...
we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty - as they showed the world last sunday .
the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy , and will continue to attack it .
yet the terrorists ' most powerful myth is being destroyed ...
and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people .
' biggest dreams ' as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans , " each age is a dream that is dying , or one that is coming to birth " .
and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born .
the abolition of slavery was only a dream - until it was fulfilled .
the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream - until it was achieved .
the fall of imperial communism was only a dream - until , one day , it was accomplished .
our generation has dreams of its own , and we also go forward with confidence .
the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable - yet we know where it leads : it leads to freedom .

the president knows he has a tough battle ahead it further developed the idealistic vision that he set out in his inaugural address two weeks ago with continued calls for dramatic change in the middle east and a commitment to re-engage with the peace process between israel and the palestinians .
and he laid out ambitious domestic plans including his call for reforms to social security , the public pension scheme .
but his foreign policy ambitions will be limited by progress in iraq and his ambitious plans at home will be limited by the mounting us debt .
tough battles ahead as expected , he spent a great deal of time outlining the problems with social security and talking about his proposals to save the system .
but his figures were met with groans from his democratic opponents in a rare departure from the deference usually afforded presidents during their state of the union addresses .
mr bush sought to shore up support from the conservative base this is a president who had a very easy ride in congress during his first term .
partly because of the 9/11 factor , he was able to get things passed through congress that he would never have been able to normally .
he has identified social security as a priority .
the talk in washington is that he wants congress to take action on reform quickly - within the next five or six months .
but despite his confident delivery , he knows he has a tough battle .
he begins a five-state campaign on thursday to sell his plan .
and in his speech , he worked to shore up his support with conservative evangelical christians , who take a great deal of credit for his re-election .
the arlington group , comprised of leading conservative evangelical leaders , has threatened to withhold their support for mr bush 's social security plans if he does not vigorously pursue a ban on same-sex marriage .
mr bush did call for a constitutional amendment to protect marriage from " activist " judges .
that is a box he had to tick , but it will be down to a question of rhetoric and reality .
by the brevity of the mention , he did not sound entirely confident that he would be able to push anything through congress .
and of his other domestic initiatives , he will be limited by the burgeoning us deficit , especially in light of his renewed promise to cut it in half by 2009 .
freedom and foreign policy president bush 's state of the union speech restated the central theme of his inaugural address that the us should commit itself to the spread of freedom around the world .
" the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror , and replace hatred with hope , is the force of human freedom , " mr bush said .
some elements were expected .
he continued with tough talk about iran .
" today , iran remains the world 's primary state sponsor of terror - pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve , " mr bush said .
the president acknowledged deaths in iraq but despite his strong rhetoric , this speech indicated that he very much wanted to keep his options open .
he spoke of working with the europeans to convince iran to abandon its uranium enrichment programme and its sponsorship of terror .
but he also said with his eyes looking straight at the camera : " as you stand for your own liberty , america stands with you . "
other elements of his speech were unexpected .
mr bush spoke with much stronger conviction about the palestinian-israeli peace process with a call on congress to commit $ 350m for palestinian political , economic and security reforms .
and he said : " the goal of two democratic states , israel and palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach - and america will help them achieve that goal . "
thinking big but one of the moments that many will take away was of a mother whose son was killed in iraq emotionally embracing an iraqi human-rights campaigner .
janet norwood 's marine son , sgt byron norwood , was killed in the assault on falluja , and mr bush acknowledged her and in doing so , publicly acknowledged that troops are dying in iraq .
mr bush ran with the themes that he laid out in his inauguration .
he is a man who thinks big and takes big risks .
and as his second term begins , he knows that he has only a short time to spend the political capital he thinks he earned in his re-election .
tonight was a call to action for mr bush 's republican allies in congress .
for his opposition , it was a call to arms .

but his figures were met with groans from his democratic opponents in a rare departure from the deference usually afforded presidents during their state of the union addresses .
mr bush sought to shore up support from the conservative base this is a president who had a very easy ride in congress during his first term .
partly because of the 9/11 factor , he was able to get things passed through congress that he would never have been able to normally .
he has identified social security as a priority .
the talk in washington is that he wants congress to take action on reform quickly - within the next five or six months .
but despite his confident delivery , he knows he has a tough battle .
he begins a five-state campaign on thursday to sell his plan .
and in his speech , he worked to shore up his support with conservative evangelical christians , who take a great deal of credit for his re-election .
the arlington group , comprised of leading conservative evangelical leaders , has threatened to withhold their support for mr bush 's social security plans if he does not vigorously pursue a ban on same-sex marriage .
mr bush did call for a constitutional amendment to protect marriage from " activist " judges .
that is a box he had to tick , but it will be down to a question of rhetoric and reality .
by the brevity of the mention , he did not sound entirely confident that he would be able to push anything through congress .
and of his other domestic initiatives , he will be limited by the burgeoning us deficit , especially in light of his renewed promise to cut it in half by 2009 .
freedom and foreign policy president bush 's state of the union speech restated the central theme of his inaugural address that the us should commit itself to the spread of freedom around the world .
" the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror , and replace hatred with hope , is the force of human freedom , " mr bush said .
some elements were expected .
he continued with tough talk about iran .
" today , iran remains the world 's primary state sponsor of terror - pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve , " mr bush said .
the president acknowledged deaths in iraq but despite his strong rhetoric , this speech indicated that he very much wanted to keep his options open .
he spoke of working with the europeans to convince iran to abandon its uranium enrichment programme and its sponsorship of terror .
but he also said with his eyes looking straight at the camera : " as you stand for your own liberty , america stands with you . "
other elements of his speech were unexpected .
mr bush spoke with much stronger conviction about the palestinian-israeli peace process with a call on congress to commit $ 350m for palestinian political , economic and security reforms .
and he said : " the goal of two democratic states , israel and palestine , living side by side in peace is within reach - and america will help them achieve that goal . "
thinking big but one of the moments that many will take away was of a mother whose son was killed in iraq emotionally embracing an iraqi human-rights campaigner .
janet norwood 's marine son , sgt byron norwood , was killed in the assault on falluja , and mr bush acknowledged her and in doing so , publicly acknowledged that troops are dying in iraq .
mr bush ran with the themes that he laid out in his inauguration .
he is a man who thinks big and takes big risks .
and as his second term begins , he knows that he has only a short time to spend the political capital he thinks he earned in his re-election .
tonight was a call to action for mr bush 's republican allies in congress .
for his opposition , it was a call to arms .

in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement .
mitchell kapor , chairman of the mozilla foundation , warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future .
linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft 's windows .
it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles , which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees .
the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available .
other companies are expected to follow suit .
patents as wmd there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted .
this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office .
" some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca n't afford to take them to court , " said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office .
some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future .
" if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software ... of course they 're going to unleash the wmds , " mr kapor is reported as saying .
microsoft did not want to comment directly , referring the issue instead to trade body intellect , of which it is a member .
" as far as intellect is concerned , open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems , " said spokeswoman jill sutherland .
" the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software , " " we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents , copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries , and not be forced into using one or the other , " she added .

it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles , which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees .
the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available .
other companies are expected to follow suit .
patents as wmd there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted .
this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office .
" some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca n't afford to take them to court , " said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office .
some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future .
" if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software ... of course they 're going to unleash the wmds , " mr kapor is reported as saying .
microsoft did not want to comment directly , referring the issue instead to trade body intellect , of which it is a member .
" as far as intellect is concerned , open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems , " said spokeswoman jill sutherland .
" the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software , " " we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents , copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries , and not be forced into using one or the other , " she added .

in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement .
mitchell kapor , chairman of the mozilla foundation , warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future .
linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft 's windows .
it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles , which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees .
the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available .
other companies are expected to follow suit .
patents as wmd there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted .
this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office .
" some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they ca n't afford to take them to court , " said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office .
some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future .
" if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software ... of course they 're going to unleash the wmds , " mr kapor is reported as saying .
microsoft did not want to comment directly , referring the issue instead to trade body intellect , of which it is a member .
" as far as intellect is concerned , open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems , " said spokeswoman jill sutherland .
" the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software , " " we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents , copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries , and not be forced into using one or the other , " she added .

but what does it do and how does it work ?
picture the scene - wales are camped on the england line in the dying seconds of the six nations ' opening match .
a ball is flung out to winger shane williams who crosses to score the winning try for wales .
but the england players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand .
in the past , sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come .
but bbc sport 's new tool piero could end discussions in minutes .
piero turns live images into a virtual stadium enlarge image piero , named after the italian painter and pioneer of perspective piero della francesco , creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle .
viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom , giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts .
the technology has been created by bbc research and development for bbc broadcast and bbc outside broadcasts .
bbc sport is the first client to start using the system .
" in order to keep audiences growing and growing ... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life , " said andrew thompson , the bbc 's head of development , new media and sports news .
" we want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis , more detail , more definitive answers about key passages of play . "
piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a pc which can then render the information into 3d graphics .
six nations rugby live on bbc tv , radio and online the more cameras using piero , the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3d models .
" it allows us to tell the story of a passage of play , tracking individual players across the field , looking at tactics , " said andy townsend , from bbc broadcast .
was the player offside ?
piero will find out an operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents , as well as more in-depth analysis .
the " virtual camera " can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch , giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally can not see .
piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks , to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout .
mr townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology .
bbc broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows .

sensitive conditions in a letter to the trust , the medics said there were so few side rooms that staff were not able to break bad news or discuss sensitive conditions with patients privately .
they also complained that people with cancer-related problems were having their admissions delayed or cancelled .
the doctors want mr overton 's suspension ended and bed capacity returned " to an adequate number , reversing all the ward closures " .
many of the concerns expressed by staff are issues that wo n't have come about as a result of the move frank o 'sullivan , pembrokeshire and derwen nhs trust frank o 'sullivan , chief executive of pembrokeshire and derwen nhs trust , said : " clearly if the concerns are right , then we need to act very quickly to address them .

the sydney-based firm said net profit for 2004 rose 86 % to $ 2.81bn -lrb- £ 1.5bn -rrb- .
the price of copper in particular has shot up in the face of rapid growth in china and also the us , it said .
rio tinto has previously suffered from the fall in the dollar , since it bears the cost of most of its operations in other , stronger currencies .
but price gains in 2004 helped counter the continuing depreciation of the dollar .
copper prices , for instance , rose 18 % or 22 cents a pound between june and december , while iron ore has been rising at a similar pace since april .
every cent increase in copper prices adds about $ 13m to rio tinto 's net profits from its mines in indonesia , chile and the us .
the company said it would use its strong financial position to reward shareholders with share buybacks totalling $ 1.5bn over the next two years .
it also said the year ahead was looking good .
" while the rate of growth in the major oecd economies appears to be slowing , current market conditions for the majority of our products suggest that we will continue to see strong demand in 2005 , " said the firm 's chairman , paul skinner .

the welsh premier side want to move from farrar road to a new stadium in nant porth which will be able to host games in european competitions .
but some residents have voiced concerns about the environmental impact of the scheme .
gwynedd councillors postponed making a decision at the meeting on wednesday .
at the meeting on wednesday , councillors decided they wanted to visit the site and also said they wanted more information about letters received in favour and against the application , which would see the stadium built on the banks of the menai straits .
' safer environment ' the matter is likely to be discussed again in a month 's time .
planning permission for a smaller new ground for bangor city was previously given in 2003 , but the plans have now been amended for a stadium to seat 3,000 supporters .
speaking before wednesday 's council meeting , bangor city stadium manager dilwyn jones said the new proposal was an improvement on the previously submitted plans .
some residents in menai bridge are concerned about light pollution he added : " planning permission has already been given for the new ground at nant porth which includes a 600-seater stand with standing room for 2,000 .
" the proposals for the second planning application tonight are to comply with welsh premier licensing and uefa licensing which will be required over the next five to 10 years .
" it will provide a safer environment than the current proposal and it will reduce any further environmental impact on that site . "
but menai bridge resident judith moss , who is opposed to the plans , said the football club could consider sharing a stadium with the city 's rugby club on a different site at llandegai .
she added : " this -lrb- nant porth -rrb- is a declared area of special conservation .
" i would like to ask mr jones why he wishes to have this -lrb- stadium -rrb- on the menai straits and not share a wonderful site with the rugby club ?
' outstanding natural beauty ' " why will the football club not accept that as a way forward which is what other clubs are doing such as wasps rugby and queens park rangers , swansea , they are all amalgamating together ?
" we have concerns for light pollution , noise pollution and wildlife and this is an area of outstanding natural beauty . "
when asked on bbc radio wales why bangor city could not share a new stadium with the city 's rugby club , stadium manager mr jones said : " this site at nant porth has been proposed by both the city council and developers . "
gwynedd council said it was aware that the rugby club was a site for consideration , although it added that the rugby club disputed that it had been approached .
the council added it was not in a position to judge if the rugby club site would be suitable .

the welsh premier side want to move from farrar road to a new stadium in nant porth which will be able to host games in european competitions .
but some residents have voiced concerns about the environmental impact of the scheme .
gwynedd councillors postponed making a decision at the meeting on wednesday .
at the meeting on wednesday , councillors decided they wanted to visit the site and also said they wanted more information about letters received in favour and against the application , which would see the stadium built on the banks of the menai straits .
' safer environment ' the matter is likely to be discussed again in a month 's time .
planning permission for a smaller new ground for bangor city was previously given in 2003 , but the plans have now been amended for a stadium to seat 3,000 supporters .
speaking before wednesday 's council meeting , bangor city stadium manager dilwyn jones said the new proposal was an improvement on the previously submitted plans .
he added : " planning permission has already been given for the new ground at nant porth which includes a 600-seater stand with standing room for 2,000 .
" the proposals for the second planning application tonight are to comply with welsh premier licensing and uefa licensing which will be required over the next five to 10 years .
" it will provide a safer environment than the current proposal and it will reduce any further environmental impact on that site . "
but menai bridge resident judith moss , who is opposed to the plans , said the football club could consider sharing a stadium with the city 's rugby club on a different site at llandegai .
she added : " this -lrb- nant porth -rrb- is a declared area of special conservation .
" i would like to ask mr jones why he wishes to have this -lrb- stadium -rrb- on the menai straits and not share a wonderful site with the rugby club ?
' outstanding natural beauty ' " why will the football club not accept that as a way forward which is what other clubs are doing such as wasps rugby and queens park rangers , swansea , they are all amalgamating together ?
" we have concerns for light pollution , noise pollution and wildlife and this is an area of outstanding natural beauty . "
when asked on bbc radio wales why bangor city could not share a new stadium with the city 's rugby club , stadium manager mr jones said : " this site at nant porth has been proposed by both the city council and developers . "
gwynedd council said it was aware that the rugby club was a site for consideration , although it added that the rugby club disputed that it had been approached .

they are the first in north yorkshire to impose a blanket ban covering hospital grounds as well as buildings .
scarborough , whitby and ryedale primary care trust and scarborough and north east yorks nhs trust say the ban comes into force on 9 march - no smoking day .
the trusts ' adviser flis macdonald said : " we do n't accept smoking in other places - why should we in hospitals ? "
counselling offered ms macdonald , an expert with the north yorkshire stop smoking service , said the trusts had been working on introducing the ban for over a year .
staff have been consulted and offered help to quit smoking and patients will be offered counselling and nicotine replacement therapy where necessary .
the move follows official guidance from the health development agency -lrb- hda -rrb- last month which said the complete ban was a " gold standard " which nhs trusts should aim for .
hda officials issued the guidance after the government 's public health white paper promised the health service would become smoke-free by the end of 2006 .
smoking rooms however , under the white paper proposals hospitals are not required to stop smoking in grounds .
as yet , only a handful of trusts have introduced complete bans and 60 % still have smoking rooms .
ms macdonald said : " patients who smoke tend to need longer recovery times after anaesthetic , their wounds take longer to heal and they are more likely to end up in intensive care .
" so you can see there are real benefits to not smoking for both patients and the nhs in terms of both human and financial cost . "
