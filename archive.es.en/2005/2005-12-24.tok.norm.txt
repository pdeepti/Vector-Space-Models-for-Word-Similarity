" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

they should n't be surprised over decisions this week to make the game more fan-friendly - it was the record 6.122 million tickets they bought that made their voices heard . the host of next summer 's world cup tournament will demolish last season 's bundesliga record attendance of 11.569 million , if fans infected with soccer fever continue filing into the new and newly renovated stadiums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere will still be able to broadcast some world cup matches in addition to a week of excellent german cup soccer on the field , fans also greeted a german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decision to award 1.26 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.49 billion -rrb- worth of bundesliga broadcast right to a consortium of cable operators for the next three years , ditching long-time partner premiere , germany 's pay-tv network . highlights a " focal poi n t for family " fans will still have to pay a subscription fee to see the games live , but the public tv highlight show , " sportschau , " will continue to be shown shortly after the matches . premiere was willing to pay more for the broadcast rights but only if the highlights were relegated to a late-night time slot . " keeping ' sportschau ' on at this time is a victory for the fans , " eintracht frankfurt chairman heribert bruchhagen told the sid sports news agency . he called the show a focal point for german families and reminisced about his memories in front of the television . " i 'd always watch the show between six and eight o 'clock with my brother , " he said .
" mama cooked and we watched the soccer . " but there was more at play than just love for the fans , league boss werner hackmann added .
changing the broadcast time would have made it less attractive to advertisers and would end up costing the league 's teams more in the long run . no world cup ticketi n g fee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa wo n't take your money , if you do n't have one of these fans chalked up a second victory when world cup organizers agreed not to charge the millions of soccer fans who applied for , but were not awarded , tickets to the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- gave in to demands from a german consumer advocacy group that had taken it to court .
the deal , which will protect organizers from fans ' scorn , could cost planners as much as 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.18 million -rrb- , according to ok vice president horst schmidt . judges in frankfurt were scheduled to decide on the legality of the five euro ticketing fee this week but asked the parties to reach a settlement rather than force the court to issue a judgement . demand for tickets has massively outpaced supply , partly because only around one-third of them were put on sale to the public , while the rest went to national and international soccer officials and sponsors . fans will have until april 15 to request a refund for the handling fee . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere faces uncertain future without bundesliga rights german pay tv group premiere was desperately searching for a future strategy after it lost the rights to show live german soccer matches from next season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .

the rappers have swapped the trademark neo-nazi outfit of boots , tight jeans and flying jackets for running shoes , oversized clothes and camouflage gear . but the lyrics are the same as always : the glorification of the aryan race , the myth of the nordic warriors and hatred of immigrants and jews . the youth of the former east germany , who have borne the brunt of the reunified country 's economic slump and the impact of the opening of borders with poland and the czech republic , are the target audience . former east germany a target-rich environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has found sympathetic ears in the disadvantaged east the npd 's support is strongest in the former german democratic republic , and it scored its first poll success in saxony in 2004 when it claimed 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional election . " in the new states , where unemployment stands at up to 40 percent , the npd offers the youth a haven where they feel they are among friends , where they can drink beer and listen to music , " said patrick moreau , a french researcher who studies extremist groups in germany . " it is a slow politicization through music .
in the west , the strategy is less successful because there the authorities organize more leisure activities for the youth , " added the researcher , who is based in the eastern city of leipzig . the main purveyor of neo-nazi music is still the internet , which offers free downloading sites set up in the united states and denmark , but there is also a profusion of free " nazi concerts " on the sidelines of political demonstrations , said moreau . convicted neo-nazi holds one final concert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener from the extremist band " landser " was sentenced to three years to see how closely the npd and the neo-nazi music scene is linked , he added , one only has to recall that the skinhead singer michael regener played his farewell concert before going to prison at the party 's congress in thüringen in march . regener was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for belonging to a criminal organization . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .

the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .

they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

the rappers have swapped the trademark neo-nazi outfit of boots , tight jeans and flying jackets for running shoes , oversized clothes and camouflage gear . but the lyrics are the same as always : the glorification of the aryan race , the myth of the nordic warriors and hatred of immigrants and jews . the youth of the former east germany , who have borne the brunt of the reunified country 's economic slump and the impact of the opening of borders with poland and the czech republic , are the target audience . former east germany a target-rich environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has found sympathetic ears in the disadvantaged east the npd 's support is strongest in the former german democratic republic , and it scored its first poll success in saxony in 2004 when it claimed 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional election . " in the new states , where unemployment stands at up to 40 percent , the npd offers the youth a haven where they feel they are among friends , where they can drink beer and listen to music , " said patrick moreau , a french researcher who studies extremist groups in germany . " it is a slow politicization through music .
in the west , the strategy is less successful because there the authorities organize more leisure activities for the youth , " added the researcher , who is based in the eastern city of leipzig . the main purveyor of neo-nazi music is still the internet , which offers free downloading sites set up in the united states and denmark , but there is also a profusion of free " nazi concerts " on the sidelines of political demonstrations , said moreau . convicted neo-nazi holds one final concert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener from the extremist band " landser " was sentenced to three years to see how closely the npd and the neo-nazi music scene is linked , he added , one only has to recall that the skinhead singer michael regener played his farewell concert before going to prison at the party 's congress in thüringen in march . regener was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for belonging to a criminal organization . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

they should n't be surprised over decisions this week to make the game more fan-friendly - it was the record 6.122 million tickets they bought that made their voices heard . the host of next summer 's world cup tournament will demolish last season 's bundesliga record attendance of 11.569 million , if fans infected with soccer fever continue filing into the new and newly renovated stadiums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere will still be able to broadcast some world cup matches in addition to a week of excellent german cup soccer on the field , fans also greeted a german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decision to award 1.26 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.49 billion -rrb- worth of bundesliga broadcast right to a consortium of cable operators for the next three years , ditching long-time partner premiere , germany 's pay-tv network . highlights a " focal poi n t for family " fans will still have to pay a subscription fee to see the games live , but the public tv highlight show , " sportschau , " will continue to be shown shortly after the matches . premiere was willing to pay more for the broadcast rights but only if the highlights were relegated to a late-night time slot . " keeping ' sportschau ' on at this time is a victory for the fans , " eintracht frankfurt chairman heribert bruchhagen told the sid sports news agency . he called the show a focal point for german families and reminisced about his memories in front of the television . " i 'd always watch the show between six and eight o 'clock with my brother , " he said .
" mama cooked and we watched the soccer . " but there was more at play than just love for the fans , league boss werner hackmann added .
changing the broadcast time would have made it less attractive to advertisers and would end up costing the league 's teams more in the long run . no world cup ticketi n g fee bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa wo n't take your money , if you do n't have one of these fans chalked up a second victory when world cup organizers agreed not to charge the millions of soccer fans who applied for , but were not awarded , tickets to the tournament , which runs from june 9 to july 9 . the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- gave in to demands from a german consumer advocacy group that had taken it to court .
the deal , which will protect organizers from fans ' scorn , could cost planners as much as 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.18 million -rrb- , according to ok vice president horst schmidt . judges in frankfurt were scheduled to decide on the legality of the five euro ticketing fee this week but asked the parties to reach a settlement rather than force the court to issue a judgement . demand for tickets has massively outpaced supply , partly because only around one-third of them were put on sale to the public , while the rest went to national and international soccer officials and sponsors . fans will have until april 15 to request a refund for the handling fee . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de premiere faces uncertain future without bundesliga rights german pay tv group premiere was desperately searching for a future strategy after it lost the rights to show live german soccer matches from next season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .

but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .

" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .

" rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .

but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .

real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .

" rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

the rappers have swapped the trademark neo-nazi outfit of boots , tight jeans and flying jackets for running shoes , oversized clothes and camouflage gear . but the lyrics are the same as always : the glorification of the aryan race , the myth of the nordic warriors and hatred of immigrants and jews . the youth of the former east germany , who have borne the brunt of the reunified country 's economic slump and the impact of the opening of borders with poland and the czech republic , are the target audience . former east germany a target-rich environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has found sympathetic ears in the disadvantaged east the npd 's support is strongest in the former german democratic republic , and it scored its first poll success in saxony in 2004 when it claimed 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional election . " in the new states , where unemployment stands at up to 40 percent , the npd offers the youth a haven where they feel they are among friends , where they can drink beer and listen to music , " said patrick moreau , a french researcher who studies extremist groups in germany . " it is a slow politicization through music .
in the west , the strategy is less successful because there the authorities organize more leisure activities for the youth , " added the researcher , who is based in the eastern city of leipzig . the main purveyor of neo-nazi music is still the internet , which offers free downloading sites set up in the united states and denmark , but there is also a profusion of free " nazi concerts " on the sidelines of political demonstrations , said moreau . convicted neo-nazi holds one final concert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener from the extremist band " landser " was sentenced to three years to see how closely the npd and the neo-nazi music scene is linked , he added , one only has to recall that the skinhead singer michael regener played his farewell concert before going to prison at the party 's congress in thüringen in march . regener was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for belonging to a criminal organization . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

the rappers have swapped the trademark neo-nazi outfit of boots , tight jeans and flying jackets for running shoes , oversized clothes and camouflage gear . but the lyrics are the same as always : the glorification of the aryan race , the myth of the nordic warriors and hatred of immigrants and jews . the youth of the former east germany , who have borne the brunt of the reunified country 's economic slump and the impact of the opening of borders with poland and the czech republic , are the target audience . former east germany a target-rich environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has found sympathetic ears in the disadvantaged east the npd 's support is strongest in the former german democratic republic , and it scored its first poll success in saxony in 2004 when it claimed 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional election . " in the new states , where unemployment stands at up to 40 percent , the npd offers the youth a haven where they feel they are among friends , where they can drink beer and listen to music , " said patrick moreau , a french researcher who studies extremist groups in germany . " it is a slow politicization through music .
in the west , the strategy is less successful because there the authorities organize more leisure activities for the youth , " added the researcher , who is based in the eastern city of leipzig . the main purveyor of neo-nazi music is still the internet , which offers free downloading sites set up in the united states and denmark , but there is also a profusion of free " nazi concerts " on the sidelines of political demonstrations , said moreau . convicted neo-nazi holds one final concert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael regener from the extremist band " landser " was sentenced to three years to see how closely the npd and the neo-nazi music scene is linked , he added , one only has to recall that the skinhead singer michael regener played his farewell concert before going to prison at the party 's congress in thüringen in march . regener was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for belonging to a criminal organization . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany cracks down on neo-nazi music germany 's supreme administrative court has ruled that a neo-nazi rock group that spread racial hatred was a criminal organization , upholding a first such statement in germany against a music band .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .

rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .

" rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

they should n't be surprised over decisions this week to make the game more fan-friendly - it was the record 6.122 million tickets they bought that made their voices heard . the host of next summer 's world cup tournament will demolish last season 's bundesliga record attendance of 11.569 million , if fans infected with soccer fever continue filing into the new and newly renovated stadiums . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premiere will still be able to broadcast some world cup matches in addition to a week of excellent german cup soccer on the field , fans also greeted a german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decision to award 1.26 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.49 billion -rrb- worth of bundesliga broadcast right to a consortium of cable operators for the next three years , ditching long-time partner premiere , germany 's pay-tv network . highlights a " focal poi n t for family " fans will still have to pay a subscription fee to see the games live , but the public tv highlight show , " sportschau , " will continue to be shown shortly after the matches . premiere was willing to pay more for the broadcast rights but only if the highlights were relegated to a late-night time slot . " keeping ' sportschau ' on at this time is a victory for the fans , " eintracht frankfurt chairman heribert bruchhagen told the sid sports news agency . he called the show a focal point for german families and reminisced about his memories in front of the television . " i 'd always watch the show between six and eight o 'clock with my brother , " he said .
" mama cooked and we watched the soccer . " but there was more at play than just love for the fans , league boss werner hackmann added .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .

but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

" we have reached agreement ... to have an expenditure cap of $ 950 million dollars in the 2006 un budget , " said us ambassador to the un john bolton . the two-year budget deal was later ratified without a vote by the 191-member general assembly at a late night session , clearing the way for many bleary-eyed diplomats to head home for christmas holidays . " the budget agreed upon today will enable the organization to continue its work uninterrupted while member states pursue the reform proposals adopted during the 2005 world summit , " un chief kofi annan said in a statement .
annan had repeatedly warned that the us proposal for an interim budget for three or four months instead of the full two-year budget would lead to a serious financial crisis for the world body . friday 's deal capped tough negotiations between major un contributors - the united states , japan , the european union , canada and australia and new zealand - and the 132-member g-77 group of developing countries and china .
disagreement focused on an eu proposal for a six-month spending cap of $ 950 million , after which the un secretary general would come to the general assembly to seek authority to spend the rest of the money for the year . " it 's a new concept … to cap the expenditure within a year for a given an amount and to then say when you 've run out of that money or are about to , come ask us for some more but then people can make a judgment , " said britain 's un envoy emyr jones parry , who played a key role in the talks on behalf of the european union . an " exceptional measure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure 's on annan to overhaul the un 's management a group led by egypt and india within the g-77 submitted a counter-proposal for a minimum cap of $ 1.35 billion to cover a nine-month period .
egypt 's un envoy maged abdelaziz , who earlier had said a nine-month cap was " the least we g-77 can accept , " emerged from a final negotiating session to announce : " there is a deal . " " we have shown flexibility and restraint in our efforts but we think we have accomplished what we set out to do , which was ensure the inextricable linkage of budget and -lrb- un -rrb- management reform , " said bolton . " i am happy for the un ...
i hope we did the right thing , " said south african un envoy dumisani kumalo , a key g-77 negotiator along with his colleagues from singapore and jamaica . jamaican un envoy stafford neil , the chairman of the g-77 group , said his side and china negotiated " in good faith with a constructive attitude , " but only reluctantly accepted the six-month spending cap on the understanding that this was " an exceptional measure not to be repeated and used for the future . " " we still believe this is not a good thing , " he said .
" we find unpalatable the fact there is this ax hanging over our heads , " he added , referring to the cap .
" it is our expectation that the membership will ensure that the request for further spending of the outstanding balance will be honored when the secretary general makes his request in mid-year 2006 , " neil added . abdelaziz said some developing countries were concerned that a six-month cap amounted to pressure to ram through within an artificial timeframe the un reforms agreed by world leaders at their summit in september .
washington pushed management reforms jones parry for his part hailed the eu 's role in building bridges with both the g-77 and countries such as the united states and japan .
he also reaffirmed that " management reform is for all of us a priority . "
he said the deal produced " a budget sufficient for the un , which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform , but in a cooperative fashion . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador john bolton pushed hard for the spending cap bolton had earlier proposed an interim budget for three or four months pending the resolution of the stalemate over un management reforms that washington strongly backs . the management reforms , strongly pushed by washington in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal , include giving the secretary general greater powers in exchange for greater accountability , creating a new ethics office and establishing a whistle-blower protection program to root out corruption .
but negotiations on the reform package have so far stalled due to an apparent power struggle between un chief kofi annan 's secretariat and the general assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu hits out at un and usa over food aid a dispute between washington and brussels over food aid to poor countries intensified on tuesday when the eu 's trade chief accused the un of backing american agricultural policies at the expense of the developing world .

and to him it seems only logical that any previous , ideologically-driven projects will have to do without special help from the government . " a more balanced approach " a spokeswoman for the ministry , ulrike hinrichs , said that her boss did n't want to leave organic farmers to their own devices , but that he wanted a more balanced approach from now on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer 's predecessor , künast , a green party member , was all for " bio " " what he means is that he 's not in favor of boosting organic farming exclusively without stirring a finger for conventional farming , " hinrichs said . " mr. seehofer is by no means intending to do away with organic farming .
he 's just aiming for a peaceful coexistence between the various production methods .
he wants to let them develop according to demand and not impose any regulations predetermining which branch has to achieve what . " despite the ministry 's clarifications , some lawmakers insist that biological farming continues to deserve special treatment . " those who want to cut back on organic farming must know that they 'll slow down the enormous growth rates that we 've seen in the bio-farming sector of late , " such as social democratic agricultural spokeswoman waltraud wolf said .
she added that cuts would also jeopardise many otherwise sustainable jobs which have been created in the sector . " after all , the market share for produce from organic farming has risen in germany .
if prices were to soar , we 'd see a greater percentage of the domestic demand being met through imports , and this can not really be in the interest of the government , " wolf said .
" it 's certainly not what the social democrats want , and we 're prepared to put up a good deal of resistance . " okaying gm food brings new problems seehofer has also openly voiced his support for genetically modified crops .
his comments are in line with european union-wide legislation that has opened up opportunities for companies such as monsanto and pioneer to conquer new markets . there too , he has angered critics who consider coexistence between gm and non-gm-based production problematic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm food is still largely suspect in germany " it does n't necessarily mean that genetically modified foodstuffs should not be produced at all , " said thomas dosch of the german association for ecological farming .
" but consumers should certainly have a right to know what exactly they 're buying . " however , germany 's limited food labeling requirements are little help to consumers trying to determine whether products contain gm traces or the remains of pesticides .
and seehofer has n't indicted he 's inclined to change them . still , opposition leaders and social democrats are hopeful that a new consumer information bill that seehofer is expected to submit to parliament in january will change the situation . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany starts sowing gm seeds in a sharp departure from existing policy , germany 's new agriculture minister is promoting genetically modified technology instead of organic farming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2005 celebrating an ecologically friendly christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping it simple is actually easier on the environment most people want to celebrate the holidays in traditional fashion and have fun doing so .
but some of the festivities have a negative impact on the environment .
there are environmentally compatible alternatives , though . back when there were no cars and no electricity , people celebrated christmas like in the song " jingle bells " : dashing through the snow , in a one-horse open sleigh , over the fields they went , laughing all the way . nowadays , the holidays mean - in germany at least - that nearly 24 million christmas trees are put up in living rooms .
these are real trees , not plastic ones .
they are grown only for christmas and do n't come from the forest anymore , said helge may from the environmental organization nabu in bonn . " instead , they 're cultivated like corn or potatoes on plantations , " may said .
" the tree farmers use a lot of poison to keep weeds away from the roots and a great deal of fertilizer to make the trees grow evenly and look pretty . " getti n g trees the old-fashio n ed way eighty percent of german christmas trees are grown domestically .
the rest are imported from surrounding european countries .
this means that besides the use of chemicals for cultivation , long transportation routes for these trees increase gas consumption and pollution . may suggests getting trees the old-fashioned way : buying them from organic farms or picking one up from a state forest .
rangers usually cut down smaller pines or firs from between the bigger ones and sell them . it 's a kind of " weeding out " process , may said .
this made use of trees that were cut down anyway and not unnaturally fertilized . better to get the " real thi n g " but even buying a tree from a normal plantation is better than getting a plastic one , may said .
real trees , at least , are part of an organic cycle . " it 's easier to keep living trees in the ecosystem , " said may .
many cities offer a special pick-up service for christmas trees , which are then taken to a compost processing plant . " so , after a few months , the tree has turned into a kind of soil or compost that can be used in the garden as fertilizer , " may said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree will probably just land in the trash but many trees are n't really composted , said wilfried berf from cologne 's municipal refuse disposal contractor awb . " when we pick up the trees next to the garbage cans at people 's homes or apartment buildings , they go right into the normal trash and are incinerated , " he said .
" we ca n't set up a separate pick-up system for christmas trees .
that would n't make sense ecologically or economically , since we 'd have to send out double the number of trucks . " after all , a city like cologne had to collect around 300,000 christmas trees , he said . for those consumers who really want to be sure their tree is recycled , they can take it to a collection station themselves .
there , they 're ensured it will be composted and not thrown in the trash . e n viro n me n tally frie n dly gift wrap back in the olden days , there was also no plastic and little packaging .
today , though , christmas usually includes lots of presents - and that means wrapping paper and packaging galore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas gifts do n't have to be wrapped in glossy paper to cut down on trash , may said presents could be wrapped the environmentally friendly way . " rather than using paper that 's hard to recycle , you can wrap gifts in silk scarves , for instance , and it 's like two gifts in one , " he said . recyclable paper is also no longer gray or brown anymore . " you can now get recycled gift paper in bright colors , " may said . christmas trees do n ' t have to eat up e n ergy decorations do n't need to harm the environment , either .
christmas trees can be trimmed with natural , tasty products like cookies , nuts , and candy .
silk bows are also a nice touch . some germans still adorn their trees with candles rather than lights .
that means keeping an eye on the tree , but it does conserve energy . after all , christmas lights suck up power .
a 10-meter -lrb- 11-yard -rrb- long string of lights burning continuously from december through january uses the same amount of energy as a refrigerator for a whole year . christmas lights are n't off-limits , though .
but fewer strings might have a more lasting and prettier effect . louisa schaefer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu helping forest degradation , wwf says eu countries are contributing to the destruction of forests in less wealthy nations because of its massive imports of illegal timber , according to the conservation watchdog group world wildlife fund .

it 's about using new technology to give people peace of mind " liam byrne the computer plays a vital part in helping her stay safely in her own home - and gives peace of mind to her and her daughter , mary .
this pilot scheme has involved just a handful of people in kent so far , but the county council is so impressed it 's spending a million pounds on making the equipment more widely available .
doctors who were initially sceptical like the fact that they get a pattern of information about a patient 's condition .
mrs hannaford 's gp , dr alison milroy , said : " it does n't do away with visits to the surgery completely .
" but it 's an additional service for people who are vulnerable - so that in between , when they would n't be planning to see us , we can keep an eye on them when they 're in their own homes . "
glucose levels another system being used by a thousand patients in oxford , dundee , liverpool , ipswich , aberystwyth and east london deploys mobile phone technology to help patients with diabetes monitor their blood glucose levels .
again , the information gets sent straight back to their gp for immediate analysis .
it has been developed by lionel tarassenko , a professor in electrical engineering at oxford university , who said : " our oldest subject has been 81 and they 've had no real problem using it .
" even if they 've never used a mobile phone before , we find that if people are motivated to bring their diabetes under control , this technology really works for them . "
professor tarassenko is hoping to get the number of users up to 10,000 next year .
" the savings are really on a national scale , " he added .
" it costs a staggering six billion pounds a year for the nhs to support people with the complications of poorly managed diabetes - they may go blind or have lower limb problems , requiring amputation .
" the government is keen to try to do something about these problems - they have begun various initiatives to encourage people to self-manage their condition .
" it is a difficult issue though - it 's not like waiting lists where something they do today will have an effect tomorrow - with this , the effect will be a decade or two down the road . "
investment ministers are already investing some money in new technology that can help people 's long-term care .
cash is being released to councils over the next two years , to help them develop sensor systems in elderly people 's homes .
it might sound like something from the big brother house , but in fact these sensors could detect problems such as overflowing water or someone falling to the floor .
the care services minister , liam byrne , said the technology - called telecare - was a key part of helping ensure dignity for older people .
" it 's about using new technology to give people peace of mind - so they can live in their own home , but know that help is at hand if anything goes wrong .
but it 's also about practical tools that , for example , automatically switch on the lights if you get up at night . "
and of course technology like this has the potential to reduce hospital admissions - an objective that 's also important to the government .
telemedicine , it seems , is destined for a bright future .
