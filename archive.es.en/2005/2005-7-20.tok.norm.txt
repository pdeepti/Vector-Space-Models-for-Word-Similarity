then he abandoned alcohol , changed his diet and , most importantly , started jogging on a daily basis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few months later , pictures of his bodyguards failing to catch up with him during his morning runs became one of fischer 's trademarks .
he crowned his weight loss and fitness efforts by successfully completing the new york marathon in 2001 . fischer said that he completed his diet not only for health reasons but also for philosophical reasons , to renew and find his self .
he described his mental and physical development during the diet in the book titled " mein langer lauf zu mir selbst " -lrb- " my long run towards myself " -rrb- which became an immediate bestseller in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .

he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization . " in 1994 , westerwelle , a lawyer , became fdp general secretary and in this role began to do all he could to rid the party of its traditional image - that of kingmaker , which helped the big parties building majority governing coalitions . criticism since westerwelle has had the party 's top job , he has tried to present the liberals as an independent and progress-oriented organization .
however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .

the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .
since 2004 , the fdp is once again represented in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle in 1984 at a conference of the " young liberals " westerwelle , although still a youngster in the political world at 43 years of age , is considered an institution in his party .
he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization . " in 1994 , westerwelle , a lawyer , became fdp general secretary and in this role began to do all he could to rid the party of its traditional image - that of kingmaker , which helped the big parties building majority governing coalitions . criticism since westerwelle has had the party 's top job , he has tried to present the liberals as an independent and progress-oriented organization .
however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .
it set a goal of 18 percent and pushed that number as hard as it could in its colorful campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle presenting his " guidomobil , " part of the 2002 election 's " fun " strategy that misfired the strategy that was launched during the campaign aimed to remake the party 's image .
the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 30 years of environmental protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting for a cleaner environment for three decades the german branch of friends of the earth , bund , celebrates its 30th anniversary wednesday .
it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bicycles galore , like in this bike rack in münster , is a dream of bund germans consider themselves to be very environmentally-conscious , yet europe 's largest economy is n't based on agriculture but on industry .
this creates pollution and bund is quick to show the statistics .
take greenhouse gases .
the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .
yet on the other hand , at 12 tons of co2 equivalent per resident and year , germany lies significantly above the eu average of 10.7 tons .
nature protection project high on list beyond the abstract calculation of carbon dioxide emissions , bund is active in setting aside wildlife and nature preserves .
one of them dates back to the reunification of germany .
during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .
successes not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants , like this one in stade , are scheduled to be shut down in germany bund was an enthusiastic supporter of the social democratic-green party governing coalition 's decision to put an end to nuclear power production in germany .
but new elections likely to be held in september and the very real possibility of a conservative administration taking power in berlin could mean that this achievement would be reversed .
in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "
should it turn out not to be necessary , there will still be plenty of environmental work for bund to do in the next 30 years . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prayer , and environmental protection with biodegradable cutlery and dishes made of cornstarch , the participants of world youth day in cologne are taking environmental protection to new highs .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .
" it 's possible to get increased value and more growth .
it remains the only way we will be able to control unemployment .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .
" it 's possible to get increased value and more growth .
it remains the only way we will be able to control unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past .

" everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable .

so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

" " the eu regrets that the united states has chosen the path of litigation over that of negotiations , " the eu 's envoy said in a statement to the meeting . both sides appeared to leave the door open to talks . " we remain ready and willing to negotiate such an agreement .
but the eu has only been willing to reduce subsidies , not end them , " a us official said in a statement to the meeting . " communications channels with the us remain open , " the european commission 's spokesman in geneva , fabian delcros , acknowledged .
negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

now he is one of the most popular politicians in germany with huge international experience . joschka fischer is often considered to be the most popular german politician of contemporary times .
even the recent visa scandal involving eastern european immigrants has failed to permanently damage fischer 's status as the country 's favorite .
his selection as the green party 's top candidate in the 2002 election campaign supposedly lead to an increase in votes and seats for the greens and a repeat of that selection this year is hoped to have the same effect . german foreign minister and vice chancellor in the red-green coalition since 1998 , fischer was seen as a controversial choice due to his history of radicalism . born third child of a butcher in gerabronn , in the southern state of baden-württemberg , fischer dropped out of high school in 1965 to pursue an apprenticeship as a photographer .
this flight of fancy lasted one year , until he quit in 1966 . a year later , fischer began his involvement with the left-wing movement , first in stuttgart and then frankfurt where he was involved in civil unrest surrounding protest marches in the city . bildunterschrift : in 1971 he started working at automobile maker opel as a cover for agitating the workers .
some months later he was fired because of his propaganda activities and made a living through unskilled work as a taxi driver and later as a bookshop clerk in the karl marx bookshop in frankfurt at the same time as he followed his calling of the time : political activism . deutscher herbst prompts change but the so-called " deutscher herbst , " the german autumn of 1977 , a period of leftist terrorism led by the red army faction of andreas baader and ulrike meinhof caused fischer to have a change of heart , he has said .
fischer subsequently renounced violent and radical action and became engaged in the social movements and later in the newly founded german green party , mainly in the state of hesse . fischer was a member of the german bundestag for the green party from 1983 to 1985 and became hesse 's environmant minister in 1985 in the first ever state level social democratic-green party coalition in germany . he was re-elected in 1991 and went on to again become a member of the bundestag , working as one of two co-chairs for the green parliamentary group .
fischer became the vice chancellor and foreign minister of germany in 1998 and was re-elected in 2002 . support of kosovo war led to controversial stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year after becoming foreign minister for the first time , fischer was called upon to give his support for german participation in the kosovo war . he endorsed the controversial stance , supporting the move to send german soldiers into combat for the first time since world war ii .
while rumors suggest that fischer was strongly in favor of stationing of german troops in afghanistan , he was adamantly against the war in iraq . some say that fischer 's huge popularity stems not from his political conviction but from his personal achievements and integrity . thin is in as fischer reinvented himself fischer gained great public respect in 2000 after undergoing a painful , but successful , diet .
until then , he had been a confirmed food and drink fan , which was evident by his substantial girth .
then he abandoned alcohol , changed his diet and , most importantly , started jogging on a daily basis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few months later , pictures of his bodyguards failing to catch up with him during his morning runs became one of fischer 's trademarks .
he crowned his weight loss and fitness efforts by successfully completing the new york marathon in 2001 . fischer said that he completed his diet not only for health reasons but also for philosophical reasons , to renew and find his self .
he described his mental and physical development during the diet in the book titled " mein langer lauf zu mir selbst " -lrb- " my long run towards myself " -rrb- which became an immediate bestseller in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .

campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "

disaffected germans , the ones merkel feels her party must meet , are attracted to the new party .
something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .
he told the rheinische post that the news sources in the west have helped those who actually want to harm the country , gysi and lafontaine , come back to life .
concern amongst the other parties the social democrats should be even more concerned .
they are losing their traditional voter base .
many of their left-wing members are now marching with lafontaine under the banner of social justice and singing worker 's hymns .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job . " business leaders uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko speaks before the german parliament of his goal of forming closer ties with the eu economic growth in ukraine has dropped from 12 percent a year ago to just over one percent this year .
exports have declined and the business community is nervous about the direction the government is going .
to combat rampant corruption , the government has scrapped the special economic zones set up by the old regime for the kutschma clan .
but , as ferdinand pavel of the german institute for economic research in berlin points out , there has been such a terrible outcry from investors , both domestic and foreign , who were depending on the promised tax breaks , that yushchenko has dropped the plan " businesses are having trouble seeing a perspective and understanding how the government plans to proceed .
the government has failed to give them the support they need to invest , " pavel said . so far , the disappointment has been limited to the business community .
the public still supports yushchenko , but that could change in the months to come .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for next spring and a winter filled with rising energy prices , tense relations with russia and economic stagnation could prove to be more than ukraine can bear . christiane hoffmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato fuels ukrainian hopes for entry nato has vowed to do everything possible to help ukraine carry out reforms needed to move towards joining the alliance , but stopped short of naming a target date for entry .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .

his selection as the green party 's top candidate in the 2002 election campaign supposedly lead to an increase in votes and seats for the greens and a repeat of that selection this year is hoped to have the same effect . german foreign minister and vice chancellor in the red-green coalition since 1998 , fischer was seen as a controversial choice due to his history of radicalism . born third child of a butcher in gerabronn , in the southern state of baden-württemberg , fischer dropped out of high school in 1965 to pursue an apprenticeship as a photographer .

until then , he had been a confirmed food and drink fan , which was evident by his substantial girth .
then he abandoned alcohol , changed his diet and , most importantly , started jogging on a daily basis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few months later , pictures of his bodyguards failing to catch up with him during his morning runs became one of fischer 's trademarks .
he crowned his weight loss and fitness efforts by successfully completing the new york marathon in 2001 . fischer said that he completed his diet not only for health reasons but also for philosophical reasons , to renew and find his self .
he described his mental and physical development during the diet in the book titled " mein langer lauf zu mir selbst " -lrb- " my long run towards myself " -rrb- which became an immediate bestseller in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .
since 2004 , the fdp is once again represented in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle in 1984 at a conference of the " young liberals " westerwelle , although still a youngster in the political world at 43 years of age , is considered an institution in his party .
he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization .

however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .
it set a goal of 18 percent and pushed that number as hard as it could in its colorful campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle presenting his " guidomobil , " part of the 2002 election 's " fun " strategy that misfired the strategy that was launched during the campaign aimed to remake the party 's image .
the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .

" ' commitment to angela merkel during the last federal elections , westerwelle refused to make a commitment about a coalition in the case of a change in government .
this time , however , as likely early elections in the fall approach , the fdp 's desires are much clearer : it wants to enter into government with the conservative union bloc . the fdp has been sitting in the parliament 's opposition benches since 1998 , but has never wanted to get used to that particular seating order , especially since for years they had been part of government , either as partners with the christian democratic union / christian social union or with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle with cdu head merkel " i believe that angela merkel would make a very good chancellor , " said westerwelle in comments about the upcoming elections and the union 's campaign for the chancellery .
" however , i also believe that the liberals can ensure that the conservatives have the courage to make the important changes the country needs .

fischer became the vice chancellor and foreign minister of germany in 1998 and was re-elected in 2002 . support of kosovo war led to controversial stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year after becoming foreign minister for the first time , fischer was called upon to give his support for german participation in the kosovo war . he endorsed the controversial stance , supporting the move to send german soldiers into combat for the first time since world war ii .
while rumors suggest that fischer was strongly in favor of stationing of german troops in afghanistan , he was adamantly against the war in iraq . some say that fischer 's huge popularity stems not from his political conviction but from his personal achievements and integrity . thin is in as fischer reinvented himself fischer gained great public respect in 2000 after undergoing a painful , but successful , diet .
until then , he had been a confirmed food and drink fan , which was evident by his substantial girth .
then he abandoned alcohol , changed his diet and , most importantly , started jogging on a daily basis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few months later , pictures of his bodyguards failing to catch up with him during his morning runs became one of fischer 's trademarks .
he crowned his weight loss and fitness efforts by successfully completing the new york marathon in 2001 . fischer said that he completed his diet not only for health reasons but also for philosophical reasons , to renew and find his self .
he described his mental and physical development during the diet in the book titled " mein langer lauf zu mir selbst " -lrb- " my long run towards myself " -rrb- which became an immediate bestseller in germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de should fischer stay or go ?

the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .

however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .

the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .

in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .

negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

" " the eu regrets that the united states has chosen the path of litigation over that of negotiations , " the eu 's envoy said in a statement to the meeting . both sides appeared to leave the door open to talks . " we remain ready and willing to negotiate such an agreement .
but the eu has only been willing to reduce subsidies , not end them , " a us official said in a statement to the meeting . " communications channels with the us remain open , " the european commission 's spokesman in geneva , fabian delcros , acknowledged .
negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

she may not have been thrilled with the comparison at first , but a housewife from lübeck is enjoying a burgeoning career as chancellor candidate angela merkel 's double . " my telephone never stops ringing , " says 45-year-old susanne knoll when asked about her new-found fame as the doppelganger for cdu chairwoman and chancellor candidate , angela merkel . over the past few weeks , knoll 's diary has been overflowing with bookings to appear as the woman many believe now has a very good chance of becoming germany 's first female chancellor .
even incumbent gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have booked knoll during their election campaign , her agent jochen florstedt said . knoll admits she was less than enthused when friends and relatives started telling her how much she resembled merkel , who is known for her plain looks and frumpy style . resemblance a " blow " " i did n't want to believe it .
i know i am no beauty but given merkel 's image , the idea that i resembled her was something of a blow , " knoll said . " i comforted myself by saying i only looked like her when i made an effort to , or when i looked tired and drawn . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new angela : softer hair , more make-up lucky for knoll , merkel has had an image overhaul in recent weeks , softening her severe hairstyle , applying more make-up and wearing more flattering suits . fun and financially rewarding knoll admits she 's starting to have fun in her new role , not least because of the tidy paychecks she 's able to take home as a result . " i now study -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- way of talking , and her gestures .
i never miss her talkshow appearances , and in the meantime , i 've also read her book , " knoll said . when it comes to politics , though , the similarities end .
knoll supports schröder 's party , the spd . still , she might be forgiven for hoping the pollsters are correct in predicting a merkel victory in the next general election .
anything else would be an occupational hazard . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

she may not have been thrilled with the comparison at first , but a housewife from lübeck is enjoying a burgeoning career as chancellor candidate angela merkel 's double . " my telephone never stops ringing , " says 45-year-old susanne knoll when asked about her new-found fame as the doppelganger for cdu chairwoman and chancellor candidate , angela merkel . over the past few weeks , knoll 's diary has been overflowing with bookings to appear as the woman many believe now has a very good chance of becoming germany 's first female chancellor .
even incumbent gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have booked knoll during their election campaign , her agent jochen florstedt said . knoll admits she was less than enthused when friends and relatives started telling her how much she resembled merkel , who is known for her plain looks and frumpy style . resemblance a " blow " " i did n't want to believe it .
i know i am no beauty but given merkel 's image , the idea that i resembled her was something of a blow , " knoll said . " i comforted myself by saying i only looked like her when i made an effort to , or when i looked tired and drawn . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new angela : softer hair , more make-up lucky for knoll , merkel has had an image overhaul in recent weeks , softening her severe hairstyle , applying more make-up and wearing more flattering suits . fun and financially rewarding knoll admits she 's starting to have fun in her new role , not least because of the tidy paychecks she 's able to take home as a result . " i now study -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- way of talking , and her gestures .
i never miss her talkshow appearances , and in the meantime , i 've also read her book , " knoll said . when it comes to politics , though , the similarities end .
knoll supports schröder 's party , the spd . still , she might be forgiven for hoping the pollsters are correct in predicting a merkel victory in the next general election .
anything else would be an occupational hazard . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job . " business leaders uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko speaks before the german parliament of his goal of forming closer ties with the eu economic growth in ukraine has dropped from 12 percent a year ago to just over one percent this year .
exports have declined and the business community is nervous about the direction the government is going .
to combat rampant corruption , the government has scrapped the special economic zones set up by the old regime for the kutschma clan .
but , as ferdinand pavel of the german institute for economic research in berlin points out , there has been such a terrible outcry from investors , both domestic and foreign , who were depending on the promised tax breaks , that yushchenko has dropped the plan " businesses are having trouble seeing a perspective and understanding how the government plans to proceed .
the government has failed to give them the support they need to invest , " pavel said . so far , the disappointment has been limited to the business community .
the public still supports yushchenko , but that could change in the months to come .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for next spring and a winter filled with rising energy prices , tense relations with russia and economic stagnation could prove to be more than ukraine can bear . christiane hoffmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato fuels ukrainian hopes for entry nato has vowed to do everything possible to help ukraine carry out reforms needed to move towards joining the alliance , but stopped short of naming a target date for entry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.07.2005 how soon before ballack moves abroad ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack might have his eye on a move as well following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .
but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .
" i 'm now playing at a top european club and still have the chance to play abroad .

she may not have been thrilled with the comparison at first , but a housewife from lübeck is enjoying a burgeoning career as chancellor candidate angela merkel 's double . " my telephone never stops ringing , " says 45-year-old susanne knoll when asked about her new-found fame as the doppelganger for cdu chairwoman and chancellor candidate , angela merkel . over the past few weeks , knoll 's diary has been overflowing with bookings to appear as the woman many believe now has a very good chance of becoming germany 's first female chancellor .
even incumbent gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have booked knoll during their election campaign , her agent jochen florstedt said . knoll admits she was less than enthused when friends and relatives started telling her how much she resembled merkel , who is known for her plain looks and frumpy style . resemblance a " blow " " i did n't want to believe it .
i know i am no beauty but given merkel 's image , the idea that i resembled her was something of a blow , " knoll said . " i comforted myself by saying i only looked like her when i made an effort to , or when i looked tired and drawn . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new angela : softer hair , more make-up lucky for knoll , merkel has had an image overhaul in recent weeks , softening her severe hairstyle , applying more make-up and wearing more flattering suits . fun and financially rewarding knoll admits she 's starting to have fun in her new role , not least because of the tidy paychecks she 's able to take home as a result . " i now study -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- way of talking , and her gestures .
i never miss her talkshow appearances , and in the meantime , i 've also read her book , " knoll said . when it comes to politics , though , the similarities end .
knoll supports schröder 's party , the spd . still , she might be forgiven for hoping the pollsters are correct in predicting a merkel victory in the next general election .
anything else would be an occupational hazard . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- a madam chancellor for germany ?
after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ?

nevertheless , the affair did throw a spotlight on the possible shortcomings of boardroom decision-making in germany , where workers had nearly equal say with management , s & p said .
the scandal in which company funds were allegedly used to provide inappropriate benefits to members of vw 's works council " highlights the possible pitfalls of the system of co-determination that is prevalent in the german business environment , " the agency wrote in a report .
" although the incident has no immediate effect on the ratings or the outlook on the group , it does demonstrate how the co-determination system can be abused in ways that may not favor the long-term interests of a company as a whole , including the interests of its creditors and shareholders , " said s & p analyst maria bissinger .
s & p now has an a-minus -lrb- " a- " -rrb- rating on vw 's long-term debt with negative outlook .
the carmaker 's short-term debt is " a-2 . "
vw is currently at the center of a bribery and corruption scandal , which has so far cost the jobs of three top-ranking managers and the head of vw 's general works council .

it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bicycles galore , like in this bike rack in münster , is a dream of bund germans consider themselves to be very environmentally-conscious , yet europe 's largest economy is n't based on agriculture but on industry .
this creates pollution and bund is quick to show the statistics .
take greenhouse gases .
the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .
yet on the other hand , at 12 tons of co2 equivalent per resident and year , germany lies significantly above the eu average of 10.7 tons .
nature protection project high on list beyond the abstract calculation of carbon dioxide emissions , bund is active in setting aside wildlife and nature preserves .
one of them dates back to the reunification of germany .
during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .
successes not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants , like this one in stade , are scheduled to be shut down in germany bund was an enthusiastic supporter of the social democratic-green party governing coalition 's decision to put an end to nuclear power production in germany .
but new elections likely to be held in september and the very real possibility of a conservative administration taking power in berlin could mean that this achievement would be reversed .
in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "
should it turn out not to be necessary , there will still be plenty of environmental work for bund to do in the next 30 years . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prayer , and environmental protection with biodegradable cutlery and dishes made of cornstarch , the participants of world youth day in cologne are taking environmental protection to new highs .

william robert timken will take over as us ambassador to germany . former us ambassador to germany , daniel coats , left berlin in the cold of winter , also leaving behind some very frosty relations between his homeland and host country .
not known for mincing words in his three-and-a-half year term that started in august 2001 , the former us senator saw the close friendship between the us and germany dissolve into bitter differences over how to lead the fight against terrorism .
his departing words were that relations between the two nations suffered " serious injuries and strains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us ambassador daniel coats -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder to fill coats ' shoes , us president george w. bush is turning to an industrialist whose campaign donations played a decisive role in the key state of the 2004 elections , ohio .
william robert timken is his name and beyond a simple " guten tag " and " danke schön , " his german is said to be very limited .
nor is he experienced in the world of international politics and diplomacy .
yet in the distribution of high-profile us embassies around the world , language competency and a diplomatic career is not necessarily the priority , but rather connections to the president as was the case with appointments to london , paris and rome .
family ties he might not be very familiar with the detailed interworkings of german politics , but william robert timken , or " tim " to bush , can at least turn to his genealogical tree should he need some basic information about his new host country .
in 1838 , his great-grandfather , henry timken , emigrated from the northern port city of bremen with his parents .
at that time he was seven years old .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush fifty-nine years later , henry timken would patent a ball-bearing and found the timken company .
a century later , the ball-bearing business had sales of $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.8 billlion euros -rrb- .
with his status as a " ranger " of the republican party , a title that goes to those who donate at least $ 200,000 , henry timken 's great-grandson will be returning to germany while enjoying close access to the us president .
german-american relations william robert timken 's assignment , however prestigious it may be , will be an uncomfortable one after the difficult years coats endured .
like his predecessor , timken is known to be a vocal critic of germany 's refusal to support the us in its war on iraq .
he is also not in favor of granting germany , brazil , japan and india permanent seats on the un security council , an initiative launched by the so-called g-4 countries .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .

the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams .

but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .

the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .

something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .
reaching out to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- cdu -rrb- is supposed to attract voters to angela merkel and his party the heads of the cdu have only two months before probable elections .
campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .
" it 's possible to get increased value and more growth .
it remains the only way we will be able to control unemployment .
but many measures might be unpopular .
that 's why i say the parties need four things : a concept , courage , power and speed .

she may not have been thrilled with the comparison at first , but a housewife from lübeck is enjoying a burgeoning career as chancellor candidate angela merkel 's double . " my telephone never stops ringing , " says 45-year-old susanne knoll when asked about her new-found fame as the doppelganger for cdu chairwoman and chancellor candidate , angela merkel . over the past few weeks , knoll 's diary has been overflowing with bookings to appear as the woman many believe now has a very good chance of becoming germany 's first female chancellor .
even incumbent gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have booked knoll during their election campaign , her agent jochen florstedt said . knoll admits she was less than enthused when friends and relatives started telling her how much she resembled merkel , who is known for her plain looks and frumpy style . resemblance a " blow " " i did n't want to believe it .
i know i am no beauty but given merkel 's image , the idea that i resembled her was something of a blow , " knoll said . " i comforted myself by saying i only looked like her when i made an effort to , or when i looked tired and drawn . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new angela : softer hair , more make-up lucky for knoll , merkel has had an image overhaul in recent weeks , softening her severe hairstyle , applying more make-up and wearing more flattering suits . fun and financially rewarding knoll admits she 's starting to have fun in her new role , not least because of the tidy paychecks she 's able to take home as a result . " i now study -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- way of talking , and her gestures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable .

the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .

bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .

club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .

sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .

bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .

" " the eu regrets that the united states has chosen the path of litigation over that of negotiations , " the eu 's envoy said in a statement to the meeting . both sides appeared to leave the door open to talks . " we remain ready and willing to negotiate such an agreement .
but the eu has only been willing to reduce subsidies , not end them , " a us official said in a statement to the meeting . " communications channels with the us remain open , " the european commission 's spokesman in geneva , fabian delcros , acknowledged .
negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .

campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "
bildunterschrift : when oskar lafontaine speaks , people come to listen yet the " left party " has two seasoned , media-savvy politicians at the helm in gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine .
disaffected germans , the ones merkel feels her party must meet , are attracted to the new party .
something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .
he told the rheinische post that the news sources in the west have helped those who actually want to harm the country , gysi and lafontaine , come back to life .
concern amongst the other parties the social democrats should be even more concerned .
they are losing their traditional voter base .
many of their left-wing members are now marching with lafontaine under the banner of social justice and singing worker 's hymns .
deputy parliamentary head michael müller warns , however , about turning the election into a " campaign of revenge " against the former party chairman .
junior coalition partner , the greens , are taking a more aggressive stance .
party co-chair reinhard bütikofer has criticized the " left party " of promising the sky to voters .
in reality it is pure deception that would cost the state an additional 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 bill . -rrb- per year .
the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- should n't fear losing their core voters to the new left .
party general-secretary dirk niebel does n't believe statements by the spd and the greens that they would n't form a coalition with the " left party . "
such a partnership , he told mdr info radio , would be a step back " into the past .

there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "
bildunterschrift : when oskar lafontaine speaks , people come to listen yet the " left party " has two seasoned , media-savvy politicians at the helm in gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine .
disaffected germans , the ones merkel feels her party must meet , are attracted to the new party .
something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .
he told the rheinische post that the news sources in the west have helped those who actually want to harm the country , gysi and lafontaine , come back to life .
concern amongst the other parties the social democrats should be even more concerned .
they are losing their traditional voter base .
many of their left-wing members are now marching with lafontaine under the banner of social justice and singing worker 's hymns .
deputy parliamentary head michael müller warns , however , about turning the election into a " campaign of revenge " against the former party chairman .
junior coalition partner , the greens , are taking a more aggressive stance .
party co-chair reinhard bütikofer has criticized the " left party " of promising the sky to voters .
in reality it is pure deception that would cost the state an additional 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 bill . -rrb- per year .
the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- should n't fear losing their core voters to the new left .
party general-secretary dirk niebel does n't believe statements by the spd and the greens that they would n't form a coalition with the " left party . "
such a partnership , he told mdr info radio , would be a step back " into the past . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .
-lrb- july 17 , 2005 -rrb- the world according to merkel what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's new left threatens schröder with two former media darlings looking to lead them into battle , germany 's newly allied leftists are hoping for major gains in the election .
but how much can they really bite off ?
-lrb- june 14 , 2005 -rrb- feedback should the cdu be truly concerned about the " left party " with oskar lafontaine and gregor gysi ?

" " the eu regrets that the united states has chosen the path of litigation over that of negotiations , " the eu 's envoy said in a statement to the meeting . both sides appeared to leave the door open to talks . " we remain ready and willing to negotiate such an agreement .
but the eu has only been willing to reduce subsidies , not end them , " a us official said in a statement to the meeting . " communications channels with the us remain open , " the european commission 's spokesman in geneva , fabian delcros , acknowledged .
negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .
" it 's possible to get increased value and more growth .
it remains the only way we will be able to control unemployment .
but many measures might be unpopular .
that 's why i say the parties need four things : a concept , courage , power and speed .

it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bicycles galore , like in this bike rack in münster , is a dream of bund germans consider themselves to be very environmentally-conscious , yet europe 's largest economy is n't based on agriculture but on industry .
this creates pollution and bund is quick to show the statistics .
take greenhouse gases .
the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .
yet on the other hand , at 12 tons of co2 equivalent per resident and year , germany lies significantly above the eu average of 10.7 tons .
nature protection project high on list beyond the abstract calculation of carbon dioxide emissions , bund is active in setting aside wildlife and nature preserves .
one of them dates back to the reunification of germany .
during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .
successes not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants , like this one in stade , are scheduled to be shut down in germany bund was an enthusiastic supporter of the social democratic-green party governing coalition 's decision to put an end to nuclear power production in germany .
but new elections likely to be held in september and the very real possibility of a conservative administration taking power in berlin could mean that this achievement would be reversed .
in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "
should it turn out not to be necessary , there will still be plenty of environmental work for bund to do in the next 30 years . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prayer , and environmental protection with biodegradable cutlery and dishes made of cornstarch , the participants of world youth day in cologne are taking environmental protection to new highs .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job . " business leaders uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko speaks before the german parliament of his goal of forming closer ties with the eu economic growth in ukraine has dropped from 12 percent a year ago to just over one percent this year .
exports have declined and the business community is nervous about the direction the government is going .
to combat rampant corruption , the government has scrapped the special economic zones set up by the old regime for the kutschma clan .
but , as ferdinand pavel of the german institute for economic research in berlin points out , there has been such a terrible outcry from investors , both domestic and foreign , who were depending on the promised tax breaks , that yushchenko has dropped the plan " businesses are having trouble seeing a perspective and understanding how the government plans to proceed .
the government has failed to give them the support they need to invest , " pavel said . so far , the disappointment has been limited to the business community .
the public still supports yushchenko , but that could change in the months to come .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for next spring and a winter filled with rising energy prices , tense relations with russia and economic stagnation could prove to be more than ukraine can bear . christiane hoffmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato fuels ukrainian hopes for entry nato has vowed to do everything possible to help ukraine carry out reforms needed to move towards joining the alliance , but stopped short of naming a target date for entry .
-lrb- april 22 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : ukraine needs the west 's help ukrainian president viktor yushchenko should have gotten an even more enthusiastic reception when he spoke at the german parliament about his ambitions to bring his country into the eu , says dw 's cornelia rabitz .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams .

" cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .
reaching out to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- cdu -rrb- is supposed to attract voters to angela merkel and his party the heads of the cdu have only two months before probable elections .
campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "
bildunterschrift : when oskar lafontaine speaks , people come to listen yet the " left party " has two seasoned , media-savvy politicians at the helm in gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine .
disaffected germans , the ones merkel feels her party must meet , are attracted to the new party .
something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .
he told the rheinische post that the news sources in the west have helped those who actually want to harm the country , gysi and lafontaine , come back to life .
concern amongst the other parties the social democrats should be even more concerned .
they are losing their traditional voter base .
many of their left-wing members are now marching with lafontaine under the banner of social justice and singing worker 's hymns .
deputy parliamentary head michael müller warns , however , about turning the election into a " campaign of revenge " against the former party chairman .
junior coalition partner , the greens , are taking a more aggressive stance .
party co-chair reinhard bütikofer has criticized the " left party " of promising the sky to voters .
in reality it is pure deception that would cost the state an additional 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 bill . -rrb- per year .
the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- should n't fear losing their core voters to the new left .
party general-secretary dirk niebel does n't believe statements by the spd and the greens that they would n't form a coalition with the " left party . "
such a partnership , he told mdr info radio , would be a step back " into the past .

in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 30 years of environmental protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting for a cleaner environment for three decades the german branch of friends of the earth , bund , celebrates its 30th anniversary wednesday .
it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bicycles galore , like in this bike rack in münster , is a dream of bund germans consider themselves to be very environmentally-conscious , yet europe 's largest economy is n't based on agriculture but on industry .
this creates pollution and bund is quick to show the statistics .
take greenhouse gases .
the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .
yet on the other hand , at 12 tons of co2 equivalent per resident and year , germany lies significantly above the eu average of 10.7 tons .
nature protection project high on list beyond the abstract calculation of carbon dioxide emissions , bund is active in setting aside wildlife and nature preserves .
one of them dates back to the reunification of germany .
during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .
successes not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants , like this one in stade , are scheduled to be shut down in germany bund was an enthusiastic supporter of the social democratic-green party governing coalition 's decision to put an end to nuclear power production in germany .
but new elections likely to be held in september and the very real possibility of a conservative administration taking power in berlin could mean that this achievement would be reversed .
in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "
should it turn out not to be necessary , there will still be plenty of environmental work for bund to do in the next 30 years . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prayer , and environmental protection with biodegradable cutlery and dishes made of cornstarch , the participants of world youth day in cologne are taking environmental protection to new highs .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job . " business leaders uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko speaks before the german parliament of his goal of forming closer ties with the eu economic growth in ukraine has dropped from 12 percent a year ago to just over one percent this year .
exports have declined and the business community is nervous about the direction the government is going .
to combat rampant corruption , the government has scrapped the special economic zones set up by the old regime for the kutschma clan .
but , as ferdinand pavel of the german institute for economic research in berlin points out , there has been such a terrible outcry from investors , both domestic and foreign , who were depending on the promised tax breaks , that yushchenko has dropped the plan " businesses are having trouble seeing a perspective and understanding how the government plans to proceed .
the government has failed to give them the support they need to invest , " pavel said . so far , the disappointment has been limited to the business community .
the public still supports yushchenko , but that could change in the months to come .
parliamentary elections are scheduled for next spring and a winter filled with rising energy prices , tense relations with russia and economic stagnation could prove to be more than ukraine can bear . christiane hoffmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato fuels ukrainian hopes for entry nato has vowed to do everything possible to help ukraine carry out reforms needed to move towards joining the alliance , but stopped short of naming a target date for entry .

-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- yushchenko promises a new ukraine ukrainian president viktor yushchenko promised in a speech to the german lower house of parliament on wednesday that the world would soon see a new , more democratic ukraine .

" " the eu regrets that the united states has chosen the path of litigation over that of negotiations , " the eu 's envoy said in a statement to the meeting . both sides appeared to leave the door open to talks . " we remain ready and willing to negotiate such an agreement .
but the eu has only been willing to reduce subsidies , not end them , " a us official said in a statement to the meeting . " communications channels with the us remain open , " the european commission 's spokesman in geneva , fabian delcros , acknowledged .
negotiations were not under way at the moment , he told journalists . bildunterschrift : the boeing 777-200lr worldliner is shown landing at the le bourget airport in france after completing its first intercontinental flight in preparation for the paris air show , which opened monday , june 13 , 2005 . biggest-ever dispute the aircraft dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the geneva-based trade body has ever been asked to handle , and could last for years . the long-running transatlantic tussle reached new heights in may after airbus requested british government aid for its future a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's new 787 dreamliner . the us argues that financial aid given to airbus by its four top paymasters to launch a whole range of new aircraft is illegal under global trade rules . the us official said " massive amounts " of subsidies had helped airbus gain more than half of the global market for large airliners " at the expense of its us competitors . " " and yet airbus continues to seek and receive new subsidies .
it is time for the subsidies to end , " he added . bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 washington is also targeting support from the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , and eu member states , as well as european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- loans notably for airbus 's new super-jumbo a380 aircraft , according to the complaints documents filed with the wto . the eu has countered by charging that support from us states and local authorities for boeing , including tax breaks and financing arrangements , are " in blatant violation of the subsidies agreement , " the eu envoy said . transatlantic rivalry in its complaint , brussels is also targeting military contracts and support for space research given to us civil aircraft companies , as well as some federal support . both sides had consented to limited state assistance under a 1992 transatlantic accord that kept the simmering dispute between boeing and airbus in abeyance while competition between the world 's largest aircraft makers grew . more recent efforts to renegotiate that accord gradually became bogged down . washington raised the stakes by taking the initial steps for wto action last october , at the height of the us presidential race . the eu and us then agreed in january 2005 to shelve their action , giving themselves 90 days to seek a negotiated deal rather than face a costly legal battle .
but those attempts foundered amid sometimes acrimonious exchanges between trade officials . rulings on the us and eu complaints are not expected before 2006 , and subsequent appeals could take years to process . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us in wto showdown over airline row a months-long escalating fight over subsidies to aircraft giants boeing and airbus came to a head this week after the us and the eu filed suit against each other with the world trade organization .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 left party puts rivals on offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will have to rely on more than her gender and origin for votes the newly formed " left party " is already gaining ground in the opinion polls - at the cost of the conservative opposition .
although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .
reaching out to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- cdu -rrb- is supposed to attract voters to angela merkel and his party the heads of the cdu have only two months before probable elections .
campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .

the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .

the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .
" i 'm now playing at a top european club and still have the chance to play abroad .

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .
since 2004 , the fdp is once again represented in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle in 1984 at a conference of the " young liberals " westerwelle , although still a youngster in the political world at 43 years of age , is considered an institution in his party .
he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization . " in 1994 , westerwelle , a lawyer , became fdp general secretary and in this role began to do all he could to rid the party of its traditional image - that of kingmaker , which helped the big parties building majority governing coalitions . criticism since westerwelle has had the party 's top job , he has tried to present the liberals as an independent and progress-oriented organization .
however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .
it set a goal of 18 percent and pushed that number as hard as it could in its colorful campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle presenting his " guidomobil , " part of the 2002 election 's " fun " strategy that misfired the strategy that was launched during the campaign aimed to remake the party 's image .
the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .
" i am an optimistic rhinelander and i believe that if you want to convince people to take a different path , you certainly do n't do that by yelling out ' the end is near ! " ' commitment to angela merkel during the last federal elections , westerwelle refused to make a commitment about a coalition in the case of a change in government .
this time , however , as likely early elections in the fall approach , the fdp 's desires are much clearer : it wants to enter into government with the conservative union bloc . the fdp has been sitting in the parliament 's opposition benches since 1998 , but has never wanted to get used to that particular seating order , especially since for years they had been part of government , either as partners with the christian democratic union / christian social union or with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle with cdu head merkel " i believe that angela merkel would make a very good chancellor , " said westerwelle in comments about the upcoming elections and the union 's campaign for the chancellery .
" however , i also believe that the liberals can ensure that the conservatives have the courage to make the important changes the country needs . " if the fdp enters into a governing coalition , westerwelle says the party will argue for a simplified , fairer tax system , promote new technological developments and , above all , reduce germany 's byzantine bureaucracy . monika lohmüller -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable .

he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .
" it 's possible to get increased value and more growth .
it remains the only way we will be able to control unemployment .
but many measures might be unpopular .

solana also had the task of explaining the consequences of the french and dutch " no " votes on the eu constitution to president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko . following the peaceful orange revolution , ukraine 's new pro-western government made eu membership a major policy goal .
but now , the mood in kiev is anything but euphoric as the realization dawns that , six months ago , the eu promised more than it is ready to deliver . instead of a quick association with eventual membership , ukraine is now likely to get just closer cooperation .
president yushchenko can only hope that ukrainians are prepared to be patient . fighting over reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko the country 's relationship with the eu is not the only problem dogging the fledgling new democracy .
on the domestic front , the governing alliance , nasha ukraina , is at loggerheads over the right way to introduce reforms .
tymoshenko wants a radical break with the old regime and has proposed reversing the privatization of industries undertaken by ex-communist president leonid kutschma , arguing that kutschma 's cronies used the opportunity to line their pockets . however , the pro-business wing of yushchenko 's party and the current chief of the country 's national security council , petro poroshenko , want to limit the revisions to just a few key industries .
ralf wachsmuth has been following developments for the konrad-adenauer-foundation in germany : " it is characteristic for this government that they fight like cats and dogs , " said ralf wachsmuth , who follows developments in ukraine for germany 's konrad adenauer foundation .
" the alliance itself is divided and some sort of unifying force is nowhere in sight .
even the opposition is n't doing its job . " business leaders uneasy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko speaks before the german parliament of his goal of forming closer ties with the eu economic growth in ukraine has dropped from 12 percent a year ago to just over one percent this year .
exports have declined and the business community is nervous about the direction the government is going .
to combat rampant corruption , the government has scrapped the special economic zones set up by the old regime for the kutschma clan .
but , as ferdinand pavel of the german institute for economic research in berlin points out , there has been such a terrible outcry from investors , both domestic and foreign , who were depending on the promised tax breaks , that yushchenko has dropped the plan " businesses are having trouble seeing a perspective and understanding how the government plans to proceed .
the government has failed to give them the support they need to invest , " pavel said . so far , the disappointment has been limited to the business community .
the public still supports yushchenko , but that could change in the months to come .

now he is one of the most popular politicians in germany with huge international experience . joschka fischer is often considered to be the most popular german politician of contemporary times .
even the recent visa scandal involving eastern european immigrants has failed to permanently damage fischer 's status as the country 's favorite .
his selection as the green party 's top candidate in the 2002 election campaign supposedly lead to an increase in votes and seats for the greens and a repeat of that selection this year is hoped to have the same effect . german foreign minister and vice chancellor in the red-green coalition since 1998 , fischer was seen as a controversial choice due to his history of radicalism . born third child of a butcher in gerabronn , in the southern state of baden-württemberg , fischer dropped out of high school in 1965 to pursue an apprenticeship as a photographer .
this flight of fancy lasted one year , until he quit in 1966 . a year later , fischer began his involvement with the left-wing movement , first in stuttgart and then frankfurt where he was involved in civil unrest surrounding protest marches in the city . bildunterschrift : in 1971 he started working at automobile maker opel as a cover for agitating the workers .
some months later he was fired because of his propaganda activities and made a living through unskilled work as a taxi driver and later as a bookshop clerk in the karl marx bookshop in frankfurt at the same time as he followed his calling of the time : political activism . deutscher herbst prompts change but the so-called " deutscher herbst , " the german autumn of 1977 , a period of leftist terrorism led by the red army faction of andreas baader and ulrike meinhof caused fischer to have a change of heart , he has said .
fischer subsequently renounced violent and radical action and became engaged in the social movements and later in the newly founded german green party , mainly in the state of hesse . fischer was a member of the german bundestag for the green party from 1983 to 1985 and became hesse 's environmant minister in 1985 in the first ever state level social democratic-green party coalition in germany . he was re-elected in 1991 and went on to again become a member of the bundestag , working as one of two co-chairs for the green parliamentary group .
fischer became the vice chancellor and foreign minister of germany in 1998 and was re-elected in 2002 . support of kosovo war led to controversial stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a year after becoming foreign minister for the first time , fischer was called upon to give his support for german participation in the kosovo war . he endorsed the controversial stance , supporting the move to send german soldiers into combat for the first time since world war ii .
while rumors suggest that fischer was strongly in favor of stationing of german troops in afghanistan , he was adamantly against the war in iraq . some say that fischer 's huge popularity stems not from his political conviction but from his personal achievements and integrity . thin is in as fischer reinvented himself fischer gained great public respect in 2000 after undergoing a painful , but successful , diet .
until then , he had been a confirmed food and drink fan , which was evident by his substantial girth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 20.07.2005 how soon before ballack moves abroad ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack might have his eye on a move as well following a sterling confederations cup performance the rumor mill is hot with transfer talks concerning germany 's only real soccer star .
but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .
" i 'm now playing at a top european club and still have the chance to play abroad .

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .
" i 'm now playing at a top european club and still have the chance to play abroad .

a nationwide business survey showed large dissatisfaction with the current government . though president horst köhler , and maybe the country 's highest court , have yet to decide whether germany will hold early elections this fall , germany 's management , political and business elite have already cast their vote . following comprehensive three-week survey between june and july , 68 percent of the country 's elite favored merkel as germany 's next chancellor .
only 27 percent backed schröder .
the capital elite panel , sponsored by the business magazine capital , also found that 92 percent of those polled favor the decision to hold early elections , with another 85 percent saying that a change at the top would give the economy a boost . business : spd confused the survey results , combined with a press conference by germany 's industry association bdi , gave the spd and green party coalition government a clear signal that they were no longer wanted by the business community .
bdi chief jürgen thumann lashed out at both the spd and the greens ' election platforms on tuesday . " the spd 's election platform is a platform of inner conflict , " said thumann -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann has been bdi president since january of this year .
schröder 's spd has tried to profile itself as the party that can balance the reforms necessary to rescue germany from high unemployment and low economic growth rates with social responsibility .
but thumann said the party had failed , reserving special criticism for recent campaign promises to raise taxes for the rich and allow unemployment benefits to continue longer for older workers . he called the greens ' economic concept a " smorgasbord of partly contradictory wishes and dreams . " does it make sense to call for the elimination of subsidies while at the same time asking citizens and companies to pay for expensive wind energy ? " cdu-csu , fdp more realistic the bdi chief nitpicked on the programs of the two opposition parties most likely to be running the country if early elections are held in september .
but thumann generally had praise for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian socialist union , as well as their possible junior coalition partner , the free democratic party . the fdp can " give the country the necessary tailwind " to push the country forward .
germany 's liberals are the most pro-business of the country 's political parties , and thumann clearly wished the cdu / csu would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle 's fdp could help push the country forward , according to industry heads .
he warned the union parties against their plan to raise value added tax in order to close up budget holes opened by the government 's high public spending , something the fdp has come out against as well .
the cdu also did n't go far enough in lowering corporate taxes , according to thumann . government needs courage " i hope that they will find an acceptable solution in the end , " thumann said of the possible coalition partners . nevertheless , the union has clearly understood the " reality of the situation . " " all in all , we expect the government - with or without new elections - to jumpstart the reform process , " said thumann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .

ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture .

however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .

it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .

the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .

during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .

in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.07.2005 nazi jibes a recipe for disaster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparing this with a cdu election slogan was not a smart move german politicians know that using words loaded with nazi ideology or making comparisons to people or things from the nazi era will land them in hot water and possibly end their careers .
so why do they keep doing it ? earlier this month , a prominent member of the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- stirred up a political hornets ' nest when he likened a phrase in the opposition christian democrats ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- election platform to a notorious nazi slogan .
ludwig stiegler is known for being outspoken , but his comparison of the cdu 's job creation slogan , " what creates work is good for society , " with the phrase that often appeared above nazi concentration camps , " work sets you free , " was a step too far .
his nazi comparison drew widespread condemnation , and not just from within the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering : " not our language " " democratic parties should not clash using slogans of far-right parties or of the nazis , " spd chairman franz müntefering said .
" that is not our language . " they should n't , but they so often do .
stiegler 's misstep was hardly an isolated incident .
only weeks before , veteran politician and leader of germany 's new left-wing party oskar lafontaine caused an uproar by using the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " -lrb- foreign workers -rrb- in a speech on unemployment . long list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister herta däubler-gmelin takes her seat prior to a press conference in berlin on sept .
20 , 2002 , where she wanted to comment on reports that she had compared us president george w. bush to adolf hitler for threatening war on iraq looking back at german postwar politics , it 's not difficult to amass a whole catalog of nazi comparisons and gaffes , intentional and otherwise . in many cases , the incidents had serious consequences for the politician in question .
one of the most frequently cited examples is that of former justice minister herta däubler-gmelin -lrb- spd -rrb- .
during the 2002 campaign , she compared us president george w. bush 's tactics on iraq to those of adolf hitler , effectively ending her career . knowing just how sensitive and aware germans are when it comes to talking about the nazi past , the long list of similar blunders is bewildering .
why do n't politicians just ban all nazi references and comparisons from their vocabulary ?
why do they tread such risky terrain ? " there are two main reasons , " said dr. martin wengeler , a linguist at heinrich heine university in düsseldorf and co-author of a book about the history of controversial terms in the german language . " the first is to gain attention in politics , especially during election campaigns , when it happens more frequently .
it 's a way of hitting out at political opponents , to defame them .
the second reason is that the nazi past still plays a role in the political discourse today .
political rhetoric often involves looking back on the past , using the past to serve as a warning , perhaps .
the nazi past is a very dramatic way of sharpening a debate . " importance of 1968 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the german jewish council , paul spiegel , at the laying of a cornerstone to build a new syngogue at the place of the old synagogue in downtown gelsenkirchen , western germany the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , once told zdf television that he attributed the frequency with which nazi terms and comparisons pop up in political discourse to the weakening of taboos around the subject . " i 've come to the conclusion that inhibitions in the communication of ideas we thought were no longer part of everyday life in germany are lower now .
people are more prepared now to give voice to hurtful things then they were in the past , " spiegel said . but wengeler said his research tells a different story .
in the period immediately after the war , he said , nazi comparisons were made and words used that did n't draw the kind of condemnation they would today .
the turning point , according to wengele , was the student movement of 1968 , which marked a change in how germans dealt with the past . " after 1968 , the sensibilities surrounding the nazi past became much stronger , and there were certain things that you just couldn ’ t say anymore , which was a good thing , " wengeler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the generation that changed the way germans think about their past - " the 68'ers " the result was a new era of political correctness , which today is inspiring some politicians - particularly from the far-right - to rebel .
a recent high-profile example took place on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of dresden , an event many from the far-right in germany insisted on referring to as a " bombing holocaust " in an effort to reclaim a word that people the world over singularly associate with the nazis ' killing of the jews . what 's in a word ? after the war , linguists concerned with the " de-nazification " of the german language engaged in countless debates about which words ought to be struck from popular use , and which were still permissible . " everyday words such as ' betreuung , ' -lrb- to care for -rrb- were discussed , because the nazis used that word to talk about how prisoners in concentration camps were treated , " wengeler said .
" most linguists agree that such a word can be used again .
but when there are particular words that have a strong association with nazi crimes - for example , ' entartete kunst , ' which is how the nazis described art they banned - then it ’ s not okay to use them in political discourse today . " many politicians who resort to nazi-tainted terms or comparisons to make a point or score one against an opponent defend themselves in the aftermath by saying the word just slipped out in the heat of the moment . for wengeler , that excuse is unacceptable . " it is part of our national political culture that such things do n't just slip out , " he said . functioning democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : given the history of nazi gaffes in german postwar politics , it 's reasonable to assume that it 's just a matter of time before the next scandal hits the headlines .
but even that certainty has a positive element , wengeler said . " the fact that such a big deal is made when this sort of thing happens is a sign that a culture of defamation is not encouraged in germany .
it ’ s a sign of a functioning democratic culture . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .

although the leftists do n't want to rule , they will take important votes . it all seems a shoe-in for the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
in angela merkel , they can kill two birds with one stone .
they have a chancellor candidate from the east to rein in votes from that vital part of the electorate .
they also have potentially the first woman chancellor in german history .
a fact that may win critical swing votes .
the recipe for victory is straight out of the political campaign strategy book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " left party " leaders lothar bisky -lrb- right -rrb- and gregor gysi and then came " the left party . "
the former party for democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the sed party that ruled east germany for almost 40 years , joined forces with the western-based election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- .
the result : a party that , according to the most recent public opinion polls , has become the third strongest party in germany .
the country 's main parties , particularly the conservative cdu , are alarmed .
the cdu feel that the " left party " could steal so many votes as to foil their victory party plans .
in 2002 , the opposition to the brewing invasion of iraq and the floods in the east sank what seemed to be a certain cdu victory , and gerhard schröder squeaked out a razor thin second term in office .
the cdu leadership is now trying to nip another potential disaster in the bud .
reaching out to the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saxony 's premier georg milbradt -lrb- cdu -rrb- is supposed to attract voters to angela merkel and his party the heads of the cdu have only two months before probable elections .
campaign strategy is high-priority .
the question is whether the party should create a separate plan tailored to the eastern states .
cdu general-secretary in the eastern state of thuringia mike mohring told the berliner zeitung that voters in the east " want to identify " with her .
there should be space on campaign posters for topics that directly affect those in the east , and point out successes such as quality education in the schools of states run by the cdu .
angela merkel admits that the campaign in the east will be " partially different . "
she feels the cdu has to " meet the people in their real lives . "
bildunterschrift : when oskar lafontaine speaks , people come to listen yet the " left party " has two seasoned , media-savvy politicians at the helm in gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine .
disaffected germans , the ones merkel feels her party must meet , are attracted to the new party .
something that the cdu 's parliamentary speaker of eastern mps , arnold vaatz , blames on the west german media .
he told the rheinische post that the news sources in the west have helped those who actually want to harm the country , gysi and lafontaine , come back to life .
concern amongst the other parties the social democrats should be even more concerned .
they are losing their traditional voter base .
many of their left-wing members are now marching with lafontaine under the banner of social justice and singing worker 's hymns .
deputy parliamentary head michael müller warns , however , about turning the election into a " campaign of revenge " against the former party chairman .
junior coalition partner , the greens , are taking a more aggressive stance .
party co-chair reinhard bütikofer has criticized the " left party " of promising the sky to voters .
in reality it is pure deception that would cost the state an additional 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 125 bill . -rrb- per year .
the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- should n't fear losing their core voters to the new left .
party general-secretary dirk niebel does n't believe statements by the spd and the greens that they would n't form a coalition with the " left party . "
such a partnership , he told mdr info radio , would be a step back " into the past . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goodbye pds , hello " left party " after much back and forth , germany 's reform communist pds party on sunday voted in favor of joining a new leftist alliance , and agreed to change their name , as expected , to the left party .
-lrb- july 17 , 2005 -rrb- the world according to merkel what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .

it has been one of the environmental groups that has spearheaded germany 's ecological awareness . bund 's year of birth , 1975 , was by no means an accident .
norbert franck , spokesman for the environmental organization , said a national group was needed to address some of the critical issues of that time , such as atomic energy and the death of some of germany 's most beautiful woods , including the renowned black forest .
from the days of grass-roots activism three decades ago to a now highly-recognized group with over 390,000 members , bund is proud of its achievements , which have led to a " stable awareness of environmental and nature protection in the population " according to chairwoman angelilka zahrnt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bicycles galore , like in this bike rack in münster , is a dream of bund germans consider themselves to be very environmentally-conscious , yet europe 's largest economy is n't based on agriculture but on industry .
this creates pollution and bund is quick to show the statistics .
take greenhouse gases .
the country has reduced its climate damaging greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2000 by about 19 percent .
yet on the other hand , at 12 tons of co2 equivalent per resident and year , germany lies significantly above the eu average of 10.7 tons .
nature protection project high on list beyond the abstract calculation of carbon dioxide emissions , bund is active in setting aside wildlife and nature preserves .
one of them dates back to the reunification of germany .
during the cold war , east and west germany were divided by some 1,800 kilometers of barbed wire and guarded towers .
it was truly a no-man 's land .
when the country was reunified in 1990 , bund set up the green belt along the old border .
" it 's one of our most beautiful projects , " said franck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bund was also fortunate to have received the support of one of the most pivotal world leaders during that time of upheaval , mikhail gorbachev .
with his support , the group wants to expand the green belt project beyond the old german borders to run along what was once the iron curtain , separating the continent .
successes not enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power plants , like this one in stade , are scheduled to be shut down in germany bund was an enthusiastic supporter of the social democratic-green party governing coalition 's decision to put an end to nuclear power production in germany .
but new elections likely to be held in september and the very real possibility of a conservative administration taking power in berlin could mean that this achievement would be reversed .
in such a case , there would only be one alternative for franck : " we would have to take to the streets to prevent an extension of atomic energy production . "
should it turn out not to be necessary , there will still be plenty of environmental work for bund to do in the next 30 years . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prayer , and environmental protection with biodegradable cutlery and dishes made of cornstarch , the participants of world youth day in cologne are taking environmental protection to new highs .

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .
since 2004 , the fdp is once again represented in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle in 1984 at a conference of the " young liberals " westerwelle , although still a youngster in the political world at 43 years of age , is considered an institution in his party .
he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization . " in 1994 , westerwelle , a lawyer , became fdp general secretary and in this role began to do all he could to rid the party of its traditional image - that of kingmaker , which helped the big parties building majority governing coalitions . criticism since westerwelle has had the party 's top job , he has tried to present the liberals as an independent and progress-oriented organization .
however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .
it set a goal of 18 percent and pushed that number as hard as it could in its colorful campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle presenting his " guidomobil , " part of the 2002 election 's " fun " strategy that misfired the strategy that was launched during the campaign aimed to remake the party 's image .
the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .
" i am an optimistic rhinelander and i believe that if you want to convince people to take a different path , you certainly do n't do that by yelling out ' the end is near ! " ' commitment to angela merkel during the last federal elections , westerwelle refused to make a commitment about a coalition in the case of a change in government .
this time , however , as likely early elections in the fall approach , the fdp 's desires are much clearer : it wants to enter into government with the conservative union bloc . the fdp has been sitting in the parliament 's opposition benches since 1998 , but has never wanted to get used to that particular seating order , especially since for years they had been part of government , either as partners with the christian democratic union / christian social union or with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle with cdu head merkel " i believe that angela merkel would make a very good chancellor , " said westerwelle in comments about the upcoming elections and the union 's campaign for the chancellery .
" however , i also believe that the liberals can ensure that the conservatives have the courage to make the important changes the country needs .

however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .

the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .

they 're looking to leader guido westerwelle , whose task it is to sell the party 's business-friendly policies to voters . since rhineland native guido westerwelle took over the reins of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in 2001 , the election defeats that had become distressingly common for the liberal party began to be the exception rather than the rule .
the fdp began returning to power on the regional level and is currently part of the governing coalitions in several federal states .
since 2004 , the fdp is once again represented in the european parliament . bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle in 1984 at a conference of the " young liberals " westerwelle , although still a youngster in the political world at 43 years of age , is considered an institution in his party .
he joined the fdp at the tender age of 19 and three years later became the federal chairman of the party 's youth wing , the young liberals .
he credits himself with having turned a group of " lamblike servants " into a " critical youth organization . " in 1994 , westerwelle , a lawyer , became fdp general secretary and in this role began to do all he could to rid the party of its traditional image - that of kingmaker , which helped the big parties building majority governing coalitions . criticism since westerwelle has had the party 's top job , he has tried to present the liberals as an independent and progress-oriented organization .
however , he has not been immune from criticism , which was especially acute after the 2002 federal elections . while the fdp generally gets from six to nine percent of the vote at the ballot box , the party made a concerted effort to get into the big leagues three years ago .
it set a goal of 18 percent and pushed that number as hard as it could in its colorful campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle presenting his " guidomobil , " part of the 2002 election 's " fun " strategy that misfired the strategy that was launched during the campaign aimed to remake the party 's image .
the task was to communicate that the fdp was youthful , dynamic and " fun " - not just the party of high-earning business professionals .
in hindsight , it was judged a serious tactical error and in the end , the party fell far short of its 18 percent goal . westerwelle 's own image also suffered along with that of the party due to a scandal at the start of the election campaign , in which a high-profile state party leader , jürgen möllemann , was accused of making anti-semitic comments at the beginning of the election campaign .
the scandal tore through the fdp and resulted in the death - thought to be a suicide - of möllemann .
as a result , the party lost the trust of many voters . still , westerwelle proved himself , even in the midst of such troubles , to be pugnacious and possess a certain calculated optimism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the old cliché was wrong and the new one is also incorrect .
we have good policies , serious goals and a respectable election platform , but we present them with the needed amount of optimism and lightheartedness , " he said at one point .
" i am an optimistic rhinelander and i believe that if you want to convince people to take a different path , you certainly do n't do that by yelling out ' the end is near ! " ' commitment to angela merkel during the last federal elections , westerwelle refused to make a commitment about a coalition in the case of a change in government .
this time , however , as likely early elections in the fall approach , the fdp 's desires are much clearer : it wants to enter into government with the conservative union bloc . the fdp has been sitting in the parliament 's opposition benches since 1998 , but has never wanted to get used to that particular seating order , especially since for years they had been part of government , either as partners with the christian democratic union / christian social union or with the social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle with cdu head merkel " i believe that angela merkel would make a very good chancellor , " said westerwelle in comments about the upcoming elections and the union 's campaign for the chancellery .
" however , i also believe that the liberals can ensure that the conservatives have the courage to make the important changes the country needs . " if the fdp enters into a governing coalition , westerwelle says the party will argue for a simplified , fairer tax system , promote new technological developments and , above all , reduce germany 's byzantine bureaucracy . monika lohmüller -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

but will michael ballack jump ship abroad ? though pele might not think so , michael ballack is the closest germany has to a superstar .
the german midfielder has been raising eyebrows domestically ever since playing for kaiserslautern , then bayer leverkusen in the bundesliga .
the international community was served notice at the very latest after he led leverkusen to the final of the champion 's league against real madrid in 2002 .
bayern munich did n't waste any time in snapping up the midfielder in 2003 and ballack has repaid them by leading them to two titles in three years .
but one year before his contract is to expire , the 28-year-old , who once called the bundesliga " too soft , " has given notice that he might want to test his talent against major european competition abroad .
move abroad could be " interesting " " there are hardly any -lrb- german -rrb- players who were abroad that have advised me against taking such a step , " ballack told the frankurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung in early july .
" it 's good for a person 's overall development .
it would also be very interesting for me , " he added .
in recent weeks , ballack has been linked to inter milan , real madrid and - most seriously - to manchester united .
bayern brass , at first quick to deny reports their star would leave them , have now changed their tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness says ballack feels at home in munich .
club manager uli hoeness said recently that they would not go to the limit to keep ballack after his contract runs out in the summer of 2006 .
" it 's important for us , that athletic success is combined with sound business judgement , " said hoeness in an interview with bavarian television .
" the point at which we say ' no ' can come . "
bayern , ballack agent to meet in coming weeks hoeness told the tabloid bild on july 11 that he thinks ballack feels at home in munich .
" he is part of an intact team with a lot of potential , " he said .
" he gets the respect that he feels he deserves and as far as the financial side of things are concerned , he certainly wo n't end up on the streets if he 's here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : íf ballack wants to go , he should go , says magath .
the bayern manager said that he would meet with ballack agent michael becker in the next two weeks to discuss a contract extension .
after his contract runs out in june 2006 , ballack can transfer to any club he wishes and bayern wo n't get a cent .
the fact has fueled speculation that bayern will want to get rid of ballack now , if the midfielder refuses a contract extension , and get a transfer fee .
bayern paid leverkusen 12.9 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- for ballack in 2003 .
bayern coach felix magath said that ballack better decide whether to sign for bayern in the coming weeks .
" mediocre " to pele , world-class to manu , others many teams have expressed interest in ballack over the years .
pele once said that the tough midfielder , born in east germany , was a " mediocre " player and not a star .
but there is no doubt that many would want ballack 's precision passing , goal-scoring ability and grit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : though ballack is not a classic midfield playmaker , he scores more goals than most .
sir alex ferguson , the successful coach of manchester united , has reportedly been a distant admirer of ballack for some time .
ferguson is eager to find someone who at least comes close to the tenacity , competitiveness and experience of current captain roy keane , who will turn 34 in august and will likely retire soon .
" we need somebody with experience to complete the nucleus of young players like -lrb- alan -rrb- smith , -lrb- wayne -rrb- rooney and -lrb- cristiano -rrb- ronaldo , that we already have , " ferguson said , without mentioning ballack specifically .
manchester united will reportedly discuss a deal with bayern officials in japan at the end of the month when both sides are there for pre-season friendlies .
ballack has n't given any serious indication which teams or leagues he would prefer , though he mentioned real madrid would be an attractive landing spot .
in fact , he has taken a rather relaxed approach to all the recent buzz surrounding his future .
" i 've always made the right decisions so far , " he said .

it was an increase of more than 1,000 on the 6,259 reports in 2003 , the rspca said .
but there were also fewer convictions , with 34 in 2004 compared to 47 the previous year .
across the uk , inspectors saw more than 70,000 animals whose basic needs for food , water and shelter were ignored .
the rspca is using the rise in cruelty cases to call for changes to existing welfare legislation .
in wales , the rspca also reported that 53 people ignored its advice and warnings in 2004 , compared to 28 in 2003 .
both last hope 's ears had been cut off meanwhile , the number of rescues and collections remained similar , with 9,380 in 2004 as opposed to 9,410 in 2003 .
an rspca spokesman in wales said the jump in the number of complaints and also the increase in people ignoring advice seemed inconsistent .
" awareness of the problems probably have risen , but ignorance of responsibility has increased too - it is hard to marry the two , " he said .
in december 2004 , a man who mutilated a greyhound and left it to die on fochriw mountain , near merthyr tydfil , south wales , was jailed for six months .
andrew gough , from near caerphilly , was also banned from keeping animals for life after shooting the dog and hacking off its ears in a bid to stop it being identified .
shooting fears last month , a three-legged boxer dog which was emaciated and with overgrown claws was handed in at rhyl police station .
the dog , called charlie , was believed to have been locked up and abandoned .
in june , there were also concerns that a goose and gosling found dead beside a pond in south wales might have been shot .
the figures released by the rspca on wednesday also revealed that , in wales and the west of england , farm animals were most often involved in problems , followed by dogs and puppies .
the most common problems in the area dealt with a lack of clean environments and poor access to water .

maytag , which has debts of close to $ 1bn , posted a loss $ 9m in 2004 .

" haier certainly liked the idea of buying maytag , but we believe it learned in the due diligence just how much of a challenge integrating this business would be , " said eric bosshard , an analyst at ftn midwest securities .
many traders are now expecting a bidding war between whirlpool and ripplewood , with maytag 's shares trading above the $ 17 offer level .

fuw president gareth vaughan said the last decade had been " awful " and farming had to restore consumer links .

mr vaughan added : " over 50 years farming has changed dramatically and during that period farmers have lost touch with consumers .

a london commuter whose nom de plume is annie mole .
the blog grew out of a general website about the london underground but soon became so popular that it is now the focus of the site .
" blogging is like reality tv in a way , but far , far better in my opinion , " said annie .
" i started reading other people 's blogs months before i started my own and i could n't believe how long i spent reading them and visiting them everyday . "
what is it about ?
annie describes the blog as a chronicle of " the usual quirky , funny and weird things we spot about the tube " , one of the world 's most famous transport systems .
but the blog was shocked out of its usual light tone on thursday 7 july , when three bombs exploded in the london underground system .
" i felt that i had a kind of duty to keep people informed , " she said .
going underground is so popular that search engines like google often link to it when people search for references to the tube .
she said : " i knew that it would be getting a lot of people coming along and not just wanting to hear our usual ramblings but information and news .
" i had the radio on in my study and went back and forth to watch tv and do the odd screen grab .
what was difficult was keeping a balance of ' this is what 's happening ' and personal stuff . "
she said the nature of blogging - " being able to update quickly and from any pc " - meant she could respond to events very quickly .
in fact , many blogs became a source of information on the london bombings for people around the world .
how often is it updated ?
there is a daily update , often with photos .
in what style is it written ?
the writer describes the blog as " light-hearted , funny , wacky , weird and alternative " .
it is an irreverent daily dose of life as a tube commuter , filled with a great affection for the underground .
obviously the tone has changed in the last few weeks , but she said she was determined that the blog would return to " trivial mode " .
" you may not be ready to switch back to ' trivial ' mode yet , and i 'm not saying that i am either , but i felt that we needed a post that -lrb- almost -rrb- was n't related to last weeks tragic events , " she said in a recent posting .
show me an example posting most londoners are now determined to go into work , but please , please be extra vigilant .
i remember the aftermath of september 11th and there were hundreds of security alerts on the london underground in the weeks that followed as every single suspicious thing was quite rightly being reported .

a london commuter whose nom de plume is annie mole .
the blog grew out of a general website about the london underground but soon became so popular that it is now the focus of the site .
" blogging is like reality tv in a way , but far , far better in my opinion , " said annie .
" i started reading other people 's blogs months before i started my own and i could n't believe how long i spent reading them and visiting them everyday . "
what is it about ?
annie describes the blog as a chronicle of " the usual quirky , funny and weird things we spot about the tube " , one of the world 's most famous transport systems .
but the blog was shocked out of its usual light tone on thursday 7 july , when three bombs exploded in the london underground system .
" i felt that i had a kind of duty to keep people informed , " she said .
going underground is so popular that search engines like google often link to it when people search for references to the tube .
she said : " i knew that it would be getting a lot of people coming along and not just wanting to hear our usual ramblings but information and news .
" i had the radio on in my study and went back and forth to watch tv and do the odd screen grab .
what was difficult was keeping a balance of ' this is what 's happening ' and personal stuff . "
she said the nature of blogging - " being able to update quickly and from any pc " - meant she could respond to events very quickly .
in fact , many blogs became a source of information on the london bombings for people around the world .
how often is it updated ?
there is a daily update , often with photos .
in what style is it written ?
the writer describes the blog as " light-hearted , funny , wacky , weird and alternative " .
it is an irreverent daily dose of life as a tube commuter , filled with a great affection for the underground .
obviously the tone has changed in the last few weeks , but she said she was determined that the blog would return to " trivial mode " .
" you may not be ready to switch back to ' trivial ' mode yet , and i 'm not saying that i am either , but i felt that we needed a post that -lrb- almost -rrb- was n't related to last weeks tragic events , " she said in a recent posting .

the blog grew out of a general website about the london underground but soon became so popular that it is now the focus of the site .
" blogging is like reality tv in a way , but far , far better in my opinion , " said annie .
" i started reading other people 's blogs months before i started my own and i could n't believe how long i spent reading them and visiting them everyday . "
what is it about ?
annie describes the blog as a chronicle of " the usual quirky , funny and weird things we spot about the tube " , one of the world 's most famous transport systems .
but the blog was shocked out of its usual light tone on thursday 7 july , when three bombs exploded in the london underground system .
" i felt that i had a kind of duty to keep people informed , " she said .
going underground is so popular that search engines like google often link to it when people search for references to the tube .
she said : " i knew that it would be getting a lot of people coming along and not just wanting to hear our usual ramblings but information and news .
" i had the radio on in my study and went back and forth to watch tv and do the odd screen grab .
what was difficult was keeping a balance of ' this is what 's happening ' and personal stuff . "
she said the nature of blogging - " being able to update quickly and from any pc " - meant she could respond to events very quickly .
in fact , many blogs became a source of information on the london bombings for people around the world .
how often is it updated ?
there is a daily update , often with photos .
in what style is it written ?
the writer describes the blog as " light-hearted , funny , wacky , weird and alternative " .
it is an irreverent daily dose of life as a tube commuter , filled with a great affection for the underground .
obviously the tone has changed in the last few weeks , but she said she was determined that the blog would return to " trivial mode " .
" you may not be ready to switch back to ' trivial ' mode yet , and i 'm not saying that i am either , but i felt that we needed a post that -lrb- almost -rrb- was n't related to last weeks tragic events , " she said in a recent posting .
show me an example posting most londoners are now determined to go into work , but please , please be extra vigilant .
i remember the aftermath of september 11th and there were hundreds of security alerts on the london underground in the weeks that followed as every single suspicious thing was quite rightly being reported .

heather armstrong , a stay-at-home mother in utah , in the us .
she told bbc news : " blogging is an easy and powerful form of personal expression .
it 's a way of communicating with friends and with becoming part of a community . "
what is it about ?
dooce is one of the most well-known blogs in the so-called blogosphere .
it started as a blog about the life of a single woman living in los angeles , but is now about the daily trials of looking after her daughter .
" i talk a lot about poop , boobs , my dog , and my daughter , " according to the blog .
" my blog now is about being a mother who has given up her job to look after her daughter , who ca n't communicate with me yet , " she said .
the blog became famous when ms armstrong was fired from her job for discussing her work and colleagues in the blog .
her experiences led to the term dooced , meaning someone who is fired for talking about work in a blog .
how often is it updated ?
there is generally one large post per day .
it started in february 2001 and has more than 55,000 readers a day .
she said : " it 's a book without an ending - with limitless chapters .
i ca n't see myself ever stopping blogging . "
in what style is it written ?
funny , irreverent , caustic and insightful - heather armstrong often uses strong , adult language to describe her world .
she said : " i feel a real impetus to write .
it makes me see the world in a different way . "
dooce often feels like a sunday newspaper lifestyle column but many times more honest and scathing .
show me an example posting saturday afternoon jon and i took leta to the grocery store to grab a couple items missing from our usual breakfast line-up : milk , orange juice , clove cigarettes .
i usually do all the shopping during the week , but i thought i 'd share the love and let jon join in the leta shopping experience , not that he has n't done his fair share lately .
last week he took her to costco by himself and came home with four fingers missing .

heather armstrong , a stay-at-home mother in utah , in the us .
she told bbc news : " blogging is an easy and powerful form of personal expression .
it 's a way of communicating with friends and with becoming part of a community . "
what is it about ?
dooce is one of the most well-known blogs in the so-called blogosphere .
it started as a blog about the life of a single woman living in los angeles , but is now about the daily trials of looking after her daughter .
" i talk a lot about poop , boobs , my dog , and my daughter , " according to the blog .
" my blog now is about being a mother who has given up her job to look after her daughter , who ca n't communicate with me yet , " she said .
the blog became famous when ms armstrong was fired from her job for discussing her work and colleagues in the blog .
her experiences led to the term dooced , meaning someone who is fired for talking about work in a blog .
how often is it updated ?
there is generally one large post per day .
it started in february 2001 and has more than 55,000 readers a day .
she said : " it 's a book without an ending - with limitless chapters .
i ca n't see myself ever stopping blogging . "
in what style is it written ?
funny , irreverent , caustic and insightful - heather armstrong often uses strong , adult language to describe her world .
she said : " i feel a real impetus to write .
it makes me see the world in a different way . "
dooce often feels like a sunday newspaper lifestyle column but many times more honest and scathing .
show me an example posting saturday afternoon jon and i took leta to the grocery store to grab a couple items missing from our usual breakfast line-up : milk , orange juice , clove cigarettes .
i usually do all the shopping during the week , but i thought i 'd share the love and let jon join in the leta shopping experience , not that he has n't done his fair share lately .
last week he took her to costco by himself and came home with four fingers missing .

a london commuter whose nom de plume is annie mole .
the blog grew out of a general website about the london underground but soon became so popular that it is now the focus of the site .
" blogging is like reality tv in a way , but far , far better in my opinion , " said annie .
" i started reading other people 's blogs months before i started my own and i could n't believe how long i spent reading them and visiting them everyday . "
what is it about ?
annie describes the blog as a chronicle of " the usual quirky , funny and weird things we spot about the tube " , one of the world 's most famous transport systems .
but the blog was shocked out of its usual light tone on thursday 7 july , when three bombs exploded in the london underground system .
" i felt that i had a kind of duty to keep people informed , " she said .
going underground is so popular that search engines like google often link to it when people search for references to the tube .
she said : " i knew that it would be getting a lot of people coming along and not just wanting to hear our usual ramblings but information and news .
" i had the radio on in my study and went back and forth to watch tv and do the odd screen grab .
what was difficult was keeping a balance of ' this is what 's happening ' and personal stuff . "
she said the nature of blogging - " being able to update quickly and from any pc " - meant she could respond to events very quickly .
in fact , many blogs became a source of information on the london bombings for people around the world .
how often is it updated ?
there is a daily update , often with photos .
in what style is it written ?
the writer describes the blog as " light-hearted , funny , wacky , weird and alternative " .
it is an irreverent daily dose of life as a tube commuter , filled with a great affection for the underground .
obviously the tone has changed in the last few weeks , but she said she was determined that the blog would return to " trivial mode " .
" you may not be ready to switch back to ' trivial ' mode yet , and i 'm not saying that i am either , but i felt that we needed a post that -lrb- almost -rrb- was n't related to last weeks tragic events , " she said in a recent posting .
show me an example posting most londoners are now determined to go into work , but please , please be extra vigilant .
i remember the aftermath of september 11th and there were hundreds of security alerts on the london underground in the weeks that followed as every single suspicious thing was quite rightly being reported .

there are five regular contributors but the majority of posts are by science fiction writer and campaigner cory doctorow .
he described his participation in the blog as a " public notebook " .
he said : " each editor has a different purpose for blogging .
it 's a really good way for me to keep track of the notes for all the other projects i 'm working on .
" it has the singular advantage of growing because people who see it and have similar interests let me know about it and suggest things to me .
" they help me find out more about the subjects i 'm interested in . "
what is it about ?
boing boing is a self-styled directory of wonderful things - a compendium of news , features and titbits from elsewhere on the world wide web .
like many blogs it is a cuckoo 's nest centred on a number of themes , with three key topics in technology , consumer rights in the digital age and popular culture .
how often is it updated ?
the blog often has up to 40 different posts a day .
since its launch in january 2000 , there have been more than 17,000 posts .
more than 500,000 people read the blog every day .
in what style is it written ?
there is a large amount of assumed knowledge about technology and digital issues .
generally the style is terse and to the point .
many of the posts are links to other blogs or websites .
the site also features pictures and photos of many of the subjects that are being written about .
show me an example posting david robinson , 14 , of middleton , new hampshire , was playing grand theft auto 3 during a thunderstorm when he was zapped by lightning that struck outside his bedroom and travelled through his playstation controller .
fortunately , the shock only left robinson exhausted and with a black spot on his left hand .

there are almost as many different types of blogs as there are bloggers .
some are highly professional while others are simple online diaries .
we pick out six of the best .
please note that some blogs can contain strongly-worded language and highly-personal views .
boing boing the self-styled directory of wonderful things - from technology to popular culture underground an insightful take on daily use of london 's tube system written by a harassed commuter tokyo times a quirky viewpoint on life in japan 's capital city from a uk perspective 360 degrees tales from the african bush in the middle of rural zambia written by a british charity worker dooce uncensored views on motherhood , marriage and life in utah from a blog celebrity zucchini not all blogs are personal diaries - this one is devoted to food and cooking 360 degrees of sky who writes it ?
clay pot is a volunteer working for a uk charity in zambia .
she does not use her real name on the blog , nor the name of the organisation she works for , because her " views and opinions do n't necessarily reflect those of the charity i work for " .
she said : " also , free speech is not as free in zambia as it is in other countries so i prefer to be cautious . "
many of the challenges for blogging in zambia were technical , said clay pot .
" if our satellite system goes down it 's a two-hour drive to the nearest internet cafe , or indeed the offices of the guys who can fix our equipment .
" if our generator goes on the blink there 's no power for our computers . "
what is it about ?
news and views about life in the bush in zambia .
the blog touches on issues of aid to africa , dealing with the sometimes difficult conditions of her life and her charity work in zambia .
clay pot said : " we are totally out in the bush at this project .
there 's no tv , no cinema , no shops , no bars , no restaurants , no gym , no clubs or classes , and not much company to be honest .
" it 's a two-hour drive to the nearest town to get food , and that town does n't even have much in the way of amenities .
blogging is also a way of practising my writing . "
she added : " it 's so isolated where i am , that writing about what i see around me is in no way a reflection of the whole of zambia , or even the district i 'm in .
i really am just blogging from one tiny patch of viewpoint . "
how often is it updated ?
not every day , but at least several posts a week .
readers who want to follow clay pot 's blog can use rss to stay up to date .
bbc news website guide to rss in what style is it written ? 360 degrees of sky is a very personal blog , full of strong opinions .
the language is often considered and informative .
clay pot said : " i 've discovered some really excellent writers on blogs , who brighten up my day .
" you can also learn from other people 's styles of writing , and often a blog post by someone else will trigger my own memories and suddenly i 've got new material for a story or whatever .
" when you 're limited to reading only those who are traditional print journalists or published writers , you actually miss out on a lot of good stuff . "
show me an example posting many africans get indignant at the constant cries from wealthier nations of ' give them aid ! ' and i can totally see why .
but unless you level the playing fields and break down trade barriers as well how can they compete ?
africa has a wealth of resources but is unlikely to profit from them if trade rules and lack of opportunities continue to stand as they are .
