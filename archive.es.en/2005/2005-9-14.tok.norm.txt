3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .

according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .

" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .

peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .

the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers , said he expects an agreement next month on closer cooperation between nato peacekeepers and us-led combat operations in the violence-wracked country . " after the discussion this morning i know that we will be in a position to make a decision , " he said . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld meanwhile dismissed reported strains as " much ado about nothing " while rebuffing a new york times report suggesting that washington could be set to cut 20 percent of its troops in afghanistan . " you 're just chasing the wrong rabbit , frankly , " he said .
" if and when there is any decision to reduce forces i will announce it .
in the meantime you 're going to see all kinds of people looking at all different kinds of scenarios . " rumsfeld had to cut short a press conference in order to catch a flight out of berlin before the airport was closed to detonate a world war ii bomb that had been found in the military part of tegel airport wednesday morning . isaf vs. oef bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers in kabul on the second and last day of their informal talks , the nato ministers discussed plans to expand the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into southern afghanistan by the middle of next year . the organization is also trying to increase cooperation with the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which is involved in frontline combat with taliban fighters in the more volatile south and east of the country .
but a us-led push for much closer ties has run into reservations from european allies , notably germany , france and turkey , which have rejected any question of a full merger between isaf and oef .
o n e roof , two pillars ? after the berlin talks , however , nato officials said that the issue was all but resolved , based on military proposals for an overall nato command leading two separate missions , one peacekeeping and the other combat .

the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers , said he expects an agreement next month on closer cooperation between nato peacekeepers and us-led combat operations in the violence-wracked country . " after the discussion this morning i know that we will be in a position to make a decision , " he said . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld meanwhile dismissed reported strains as " much ado about nothing " while rebuffing a new york times report suggesting that washington could be set to cut 20 percent of its troops in afghanistan . " you 're just chasing the wrong rabbit , frankly , " he said .
" if and when there is any decision to reduce forces i will announce it .
in the meantime you 're going to see all kinds of people looking at all different kinds of scenarios . " rumsfeld had to cut short a press conference in order to catch a flight out of berlin before the airport was closed to detonate a world war ii bomb that had been found in the military part of tegel airport wednesday morning . isaf vs. oef bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers in kabul on the second and last day of their informal talks , the nato ministers discussed plans to expand the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into southern afghanistan by the middle of next year . the organization is also trying to increase cooperation with the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which is involved in frontline combat with taliban fighters in the more volatile south and east of the country .
but a us-led push for much closer ties has run into reservations from european allies , notably germany , france and turkey , which have rejected any question of a full merger between isaf and oef .
o n e roof , two pillars ? after the berlin talks , however , nato officials said that the issue was all but resolved , based on military proposals for an overall nato command leading two separate missions , one peacekeeping and the other combat . " we are very close to an agreement , " said one official , requesting anonymity . bildunterschrift : nato defense ministers stand for a group photo during the meeting french defense minister michele alliot-marie told reporters tuesday that the two forces should remain separate because they have different missions .

but analysts see no immediate threat from this new competitor . far from the usual auto show-stoppers like the luxury mercedes sedan or porsche sports car , three chinese carmakers are set to be the alternative stars of the 2005 frankfurt auto show , which officially opens tuesday .
the chinese line-up includes geely with five models , featuring a sporty car dubbed cd for " china dragon . "

it is priced at around 17,000 euros -lrb- $ 21,130 -rrb- , around half that of its nearest rival .
brilliance , a chinese venture with bmw , is showcasing its sedan zhonghua , which should be on sale in germany by the end of the year starting at 18,000 euros .
the three chinese companies are " the second cut , " unlike the big manufacturers such as shanghai automotive industry corp -lrb- saic -rrb- , noted ferdinand dudenhöffer of germany 's center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- .
inexpensive cars the trend but this third wave of asian carmakers is just getting revved up .
a german journalist in automobile news europe drove home a warning to western automakers not to " underestimate " the chinese competition as they did in the past with the japanese and the koreans .
bildunterschrift : the cd from chinese carmaker geely at the iaa on tuesday many european consumers need " cars to simply go from point a to point b. that 's exactly what the chinese cars arriving in europe offer , " jens dralle wrote in an recent article .
" it is not just the koreans and the japanese .
now we have the next wave coming .
it 's getting tighter and tighter for the indigenous car manufacturers " in europe , sabine bluemel , a car sector analyst at banca imi in london , told reuters .
the demand in europe for inexpensive cars has grown as buying power has declined , evidenced by the success of the logan made by renault 's dacia division in romania , which sells for about 8,000 euros .
real impact a while off still , automobiles " made in china " will have to prove their worth before making a breakthrough in the european market .
" we do not buy a car like a shirt or a plastic toy , even if the price is much cheaper .
switching to chinese products with unknown brands and uncertain quality is not something that 's going to happen tomorrow , " said remi cornubert , director of the paris bureau of mercer management consulting .
bildunterschrift : the zhonghua china 's entry into the auto market " is real , but it is not going to immediately become a massive phenomenon in europe , " cornubert said .
he pointed out that it took korean carmakers hyundai and daewoo " a dozen years to make attractive cars with acceptable quality . "
dudenhöffer does not see " any threat in the short term due to problems with quality and designs which are not that exciting , " he said .
he expects the chinese to have about 1.5 percent of the european market in 2010 .
industry already weakened a new scrum touched off by cut-price competition is the last thing carmakers need .
while there has been a slight uptick in the german market , manufacturers are still grappling with lackluster sales growth , high raw material prices and margin-denting incentives .
industry executives will also have to consider the impact of record fuel prices that sooner or later will make consumers think twice about splashing out on fuel-thirsty suvs and high-powered masters of the autobahn - like mercedes and bmw - which are the auto world 's real money spinners .
chinese carmakers have the support of the government in beijing , as china 's ambition is to overtake germany as the world 's third largest automobile producer , after the united states and japan .
" the chinese carmakers are coming , but it will be difficult for them to find a place as quickly as hyundai did in the past , " the president of japan 's mitsubishi , osamu masuko , told journalists .
" not only because the technologies never stop improving but also because the political climate will not be strongly in its favor , " he added , alluding to the recent battle between the european union and china over textile imports . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

" this is a general assembly like no other , " new york police commissioner ray kelly told bbc . it 's equally significant in terms of content .
un secretary general kofi annan has warned that the un faces a fork in the road and needs bold action . on tuesday , he presented a 35-page draft package of reforms that ended weeks of deadlocked negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council " i think it is a success , " he said .
" we 've got a good document .
we did n't get everything we wanted and i think we can build on it . "
he admitted the draft failed to address non-proliferation and disarmament , while other sticking points included the creation of a new human rights body , the definition of terrorism and enlargement of the un security council . meanwhile , john bolton , us ambassador to the un , took no pains to hide the limits of a reform he said would lead to " a somewhat improved un . " " it would be wrong to claim more than is realistic and accurate about what these reforms are , " he told reporters .
" they represent steps forward , but this is not the alpha and the omega , and we never thought it would be . " he also said the reform process " goes to the question , which is a much longer-term question , as to whether the culture of decision making at the un is the most effective for the organization . " step toward basic reform " what we can say now is that we will have a document that will reflect what is politically possible right now among 191 members , " gunter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , told the new york times .
" it may not be the great reform idea that -lrb- un secretary general -rrb- kofi annan put into the world two years ago and might not meet with the excitement of all member states and of the press , but it will be an important step in the direction of a basic reform of the un . " the draft document addresses topics that include the creation of a new human rights council , ways to increase economic development and reduce poverty and a un management overhaul . in many cases impasses were resolved by substituting specific goals with broad statements of principle , according to the newspaper .

enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .
this plan would correct what they perceive as a historical injustice that has left them as the only continent not represented on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that demand for veto power was generally viewed as unrealistic by the five current permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
early on , the united states warned it would reject any major expansion of the council , stating its preference for only two additional permanent seats , including one for japan .
in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .
yet as the united states and china signaled opposition to the g4 blueprint , the africans decided at a summit in addis ababa in august to reject the compromise deal offered by the g4 and backed by nigeria , the current au chairman . dw staff -lrb- aal / win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .
he also said he committed the crime out of concern for his nephew 's future . " i killed my sister , and i acted alone , " said 19-year-old ayhan s. via his lawyer .
in a show of remorse , he said " today , i can can no longer understand my actions . " the two other men , aged 24 and 26 , said they were not involved with the slaying of the sister . a western lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 . her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and sürücü subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .
they believe that ayhan .
s. and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences .
ayhan s. then shot her , while his brother was an accessory to the crime . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

but analysts see no immediate threat from this new competitor . far from the usual auto show-stoppers like the luxury mercedes sedan or porsche sports car , three chinese carmakers are set to be the alternative stars of the 2005 frankfurt auto show , which officially opens tuesday .
the chinese line-up includes geely with five models , featuring a sporty car dubbed cd for " china dragon . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling landwind importer landwind is unveiling a four-wheel drive vehicle by jiangling , a joint venture with ford in china .
it is priced at around 17,000 euros -lrb- $ 21,130 -rrb- , around half that of its nearest rival .
brilliance , a chinese venture with bmw , is showcasing its sedan zhonghua , which should be on sale in germany by the end of the year starting at 18,000 euros .
the three chinese companies are " the second cut , " unlike the big manufacturers such as shanghai automotive industry corp -lrb- saic -rrb- , noted ferdinand dudenhöffer of germany 's center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- .
inexpensive cars the trend but this third wave of asian carmakers is just getting revved up .
a german journalist in automobile news europe drove home a warning to western automakers not to " underestimate " the chinese competition as they did in the past with the japanese and the koreans .
bildunterschrift : the cd from chinese carmaker geely at the iaa on tuesday many european consumers need " cars to simply go from point a to point b. that 's exactly what the chinese cars arriving in europe offer , " jens dralle wrote in an recent article .
" it is not just the koreans and the japanese .
now we have the next wave coming .
it 's getting tighter and tighter for the indigenous car manufacturers " in europe , sabine bluemel , a car sector analyst at banca imi in london , told reuters .
the demand in europe for inexpensive cars has grown as buying power has declined , evidenced by the success of the logan made by renault 's dacia division in romania , which sells for about 8,000 euros .
real impact a while off still , automobiles " made in china " will have to prove their worth before making a breakthrough in the european market .
" we do not buy a car like a shirt or a plastic toy , even if the price is much cheaper .
switching to chinese products with unknown brands and uncertain quality is not something that 's going to happen tomorrow , " said remi cornubert , director of the paris bureau of mercer management consulting .
bildunterschrift : the zhonghua china 's entry into the auto market " is real , but it is not going to immediately become a massive phenomenon in europe , " cornubert said .
he pointed out that it took korean carmakers hyundai and daewoo " a dozen years to make attractive cars with acceptable quality . "
dudenhöffer does not see " any threat in the short term due to problems with quality and designs which are not that exciting , " he said .
he expects the chinese to have about 1.5 percent of the european market in 2010 .
industry already weakened a new scrum touched off by cut-price competition is the last thing carmakers need .
while there has been a slight uptick in the german market , manufacturers are still grappling with lackluster sales growth , high raw material prices and margin-denting incentives .
industry executives will also have to consider the impact of record fuel prices that sooner or later will make consumers think twice about splashing out on fuel-thirsty suvs and high-powered masters of the autobahn - like mercedes and bmw - which are the auto world 's real money spinners .

dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .

enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .

in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

25 , 2005 -rrb- germany assesses its education reform on thursday , ministers will present their own findings into the state of germany 's education system .
it is hoped that the report will show improvements in problem areas identified by consecutive damning studies .

" they represent steps forward , but this is not the alpha and the omega , and we never thought it would be .

enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that demand for veto power was generally viewed as unrealistic by the five current permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
early on , the united states warned it would reject any major expansion of the council , stating its preference for only two additional permanent seats , including one for japan .
in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .

yet as the united states and china signaled opposition to the g4 blueprint , the africans decided at a summit in addis ababa in august to reject the compromise deal offered by the g4 and backed by nigeria , the current au chairman . dw staff -lrb- aal / win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2005 opinion : diluted , but still effective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has n't quite gone where annan wanted to go a far cry from the original plan put forward by secretary general kofi annan , the un 's reform blueprint has been diluted beyond recognition - according to its critics .
dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german education getting better grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more college students these days , but still not enough a new comparative study released tuesday showed germany has made some progress in revamping and improving its educational system .
however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german apprenticeships tough all round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands-on experience is the key to germany 's training system competition for school apprenticeships in germany is so fierce that nearly 170,000 hopefuls will end their job search empty-handed .
yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .
this year , according to the german labor agency , the country is short some 169,000 apprenticeships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee at bayer so the dropout figures put out by the ministry for education and research job training study may come as a surprise to some .
according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .
and " if they are going to be late , they should know to call first and say why , " said vera lange , who heads up the apprenticeships and further training department at the cologne chamber of commerce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apprentice in an auto workshop carsten israel of the hamburg foundation for jobs said his pilot program - which has been underway for four years now and has funding through 2006 - works with schools and employers to prepare technical school students for the world of work .
the foundation tries to assess a student ’ s strengths and interests , then figure out which jobs would best suit him or her , and finally , help with the detailed and often brand new tasks associated with actual job hunting .
for israel , the idea that students today are less prepared for the world of work than they once were , is " an unfortunate generalization .

dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .

at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .

lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .

yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .
this year , according to the german labor agency , the country is short some 169,000 apprenticeships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee at bayer so the dropout figures put out by the ministry for education and research job training study may come as a surprise to some .
according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .
and " if they are going to be late , they should know to call first and say why , " said vera lange , who heads up the apprenticeships and further training department at the cologne chamber of commerce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apprentice in an auto workshop carsten israel of the hamburg foundation for jobs said his pilot program - which has been underway for four years now and has funding through 2006 - works with schools and employers to prepare technical school students for the world of work .
the foundation tries to assess a student ’ s strengths and interests , then figure out which jobs would best suit him or her , and finally , help with the detailed and often brand new tasks associated with actual job hunting .
for israel , the idea that students today are less prepared for the world of work than they once were , is " an unfortunate generalization .

enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .
this plan would correct what they perceive as a historical injustice that has left them as the only continent not represented on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that demand for veto power was generally viewed as unrealistic by the five current permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
early on , the united states warned it would reject any major expansion of the council , stating its preference for only two additional permanent seats , including one for japan .
in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .
yet as the united states and china signaled opposition to the g4 blueprint , the africans decided at a summit in addis ababa in august to reject the compromise deal offered by the g4 and backed by nigeria , the current au chairman . dw staff -lrb- aal / win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .
he also said he committed the crime out of concern for his nephew 's future . " i killed my sister , and i acted alone , " said 19-year-old ayhan s. via his lawyer .
in a show of remorse , he said " today , i can can no longer understand my actions . " the two other men , aged 24 and 26 , said they were not involved with the slaying of the sister . a western lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 . her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and sürücü subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .
they believe that ayhan .
s. and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences .
ayhan s. then shot her , while his brother was an accessory to the crime . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .
he also said he committed the crime out of concern for his nephew 's future . " i killed my sister , and i acted alone , " said 19-year-old ayhan s. via his lawyer .
in a show of remorse , he said " today , i can can no longer understand my actions . " the two other men , aged 24 and 26 , said they were not involved with the slaying of the sister . a western lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 . her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and sürücü subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .
they believe that ayhan .
s. and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences .
ayhan s. then shot her , while his brother was an accessory to the crime . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.09.2005 german business gets good marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt : germany 's financial center lights up the night a new report issued by the world bank has ranked germany the fifth-most reform friendly economy in the world .
that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers , said he expects an agreement next month on closer cooperation between nato peacekeepers and us-led combat operations in the violence-wracked country . " after the discussion this morning i know that we will be in a position to make a decision , " he said . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld meanwhile dismissed reported strains as " much ado about nothing " while rebuffing a new york times report suggesting that washington could be set to cut 20 percent of its troops in afghanistan . " you 're just chasing the wrong rabbit , frankly , " he said .
" if and when there is any decision to reduce forces i will announce it .
in the meantime you 're going to see all kinds of people looking at all different kinds of scenarios .

but a us-led push for much closer ties has run into reservations from european allies , notably germany , france and turkey , which have rejected any question of a full merger between isaf and oef .
o n e roof , two pillars ? after the berlin talks , however , nato officials said that the issue was all but resolved , based on military proposals for an overall nato command leading two separate missions , one peacekeeping and the other combat . " we are very close to an agreement , " said one official , requesting anonymity . bildunterschrift : nato defense ministers stand for a group photo during the meeting french defense minister michele alliot-marie told reporters tuesday that the two forces should remain separate because they have different missions . " we can improve the synergy but these two missions must remain separate , " she said . but in what nato officials said was a sign of flexibility , german defense minister peter struck indicated that germany would support a formula of " one roof and two pillars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german apprenticeships tough all round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands-on experience is the key to germany 's training system competition for school apprenticeships in germany is so fierce that nearly 170,000 hopefuls will end their job search empty-handed .
yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .
this year , according to the german labor agency , the country is short some 169,000 apprenticeships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee at bayer so the dropout figures put out by the ministry for education and research job training study may come as a surprise to some .
according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .
and " if they are going to be late , they should know to call first and say why , " said vera lange , who heads up the apprenticeships and further training department at the cologne chamber of commerce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .
22 , 2004 -rrb- german reunification model not for seoul robust economic ties may dominate german-south korean relations .
but , as president roh visits berlin , experts say political ties have sobered since seoul has realized it can not follow the path of german reunification .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2005 opinion : diluted , but still effective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has n't quite gone where annan wanted to go a far cry from the original plan put forward by secretary general kofi annan , the un 's reform blueprint has been diluted beyond recognition - according to its critics .
dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .
-lrb- sept .
14 , 2005 -rrb- germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .

" that would be a major achievement in itself .

top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .

six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .

it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .

a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .

according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .

peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .

" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .

they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .

according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .

" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .

a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .

employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .
this year , according to the german labor agency , the country is short some 169,000 apprenticeships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee at bayer so the dropout figures put out by the ministry for education and research job training study may come as a surprise to some .
according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .
and " if they are going to be late , they should know to call first and say why , " said vera lange , who heads up the apprenticeships and further training department at the cologne chamber of commerce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apprentice in an auto workshop carsten israel of the hamburg foundation for jobs said his pilot program - which has been underway for four years now and has funding through 2006 - works with schools and employers to prepare technical school students for the world of work .
the foundation tries to assess a student ’ s strengths and interests , then figure out which jobs would best suit him or her , and finally , help with the detailed and often brand new tasks associated with actual job hunting .
for israel , the idea that students today are less prepared for the world of work than they once were , is " an unfortunate generalization .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.09.2005 german business gets good marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt : germany 's financial center lights up the night a new report issued by the world bank has ranked germany the fifth-most reform friendly economy in the world .
that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about .

and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers , said he expects an agreement next month on closer cooperation between nato peacekeepers and us-led combat operations in the violence-wracked country . " after the discussion this morning i know that we will be in a position to make a decision , " he said . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld meanwhile dismissed reported strains as " much ado about nothing " while rebuffing a new york times report suggesting that washington could be set to cut 20 percent of its troops in afghanistan . " you 're just chasing the wrong rabbit , frankly , " he said .
" if and when there is any decision to reduce forces i will announce it .
in the meantime you 're going to see all kinds of people looking at all different kinds of scenarios .

but a us-led push for much closer ties has run into reservations from european allies , notably germany , france and turkey , which have rejected any question of a full merger between isaf and oef .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .

it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .

a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .

peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .

lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .

on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .

a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.09.2005 german business gets good marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt : germany 's financial center lights up the night a new report issued by the world bank has ranked germany the fifth-most reform friendly economy in the world .
that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german education getting better grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more college students these days , but still not enough a new comparative study released tuesday showed germany has made some progress in revamping and improving its educational system .
however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about .

she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about .

" this is a general assembly like no other , " new york police commissioner ray kelly told bbc . it 's equally significant in terms of content .
un secretary general kofi annan has warned that the un faces a fork in the road and needs bold action . on tuesday , he presented a 35-page draft package of reforms that ended weeks of deadlocked negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council " i think it is a success , " he said .
" we 've got a good document .
we did n't get everything we wanted and i think we can build on it . "
he admitted the draft failed to address non-proliferation and disarmament , while other sticking points included the creation of a new human rights body , the definition of terrorism and enlargement of the un security council . meanwhile , john bolton , us ambassador to the un , took no pains to hide the limits of a reform he said would lead to " a somewhat improved un . " " it would be wrong to claim more than is realistic and accurate about what these reforms are , " he told reporters .
" they represent steps forward , but this is not the alpha and the omega , and we never thought it would be . " he also said the reform process " goes to the question , which is a much longer-term question , as to whether the culture of decision making at the un is the most effective for the organization . " step toward basic reform " what we can say now is that we will have a document that will reflect what is politically possible right now among 191 members , " gunter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , told the new york times .
" it may not be the great reform idea that -lrb- un secretary general -rrb- kofi annan put into the world two years ago and might not meet with the excitement of all member states and of the press , but it will be an important step in the direction of a basic reform of the un .

enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .
this plan would correct what they perceive as a historical injustice that has left them as the only continent not represented on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that demand for veto power was generally viewed as unrealistic by the five current permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
early on , the united states warned it would reject any major expansion of the council , stating its preference for only two additional permanent seats , including one for japan .
in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .

the us downplayed a report it is mulling a sharp reduction in its own troops there . nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , speaking after a meeting of nato defense ministers , said he expects an agreement next month on closer cooperation between nato peacekeepers and us-led combat operations in the violence-wracked country . " after the discussion this morning i know that we will be in a position to make a decision , " he said . us defense secretary donald rumsfeld meanwhile dismissed reported strains as " much ado about nothing " while rebuffing a new york times report suggesting that washington could be set to cut 20 percent of its troops in afghanistan . " you 're just chasing the wrong rabbit , frankly , " he said .
" if and when there is any decision to reduce forces i will announce it .
in the meantime you 're going to see all kinds of people looking at all different kinds of scenarios .

but a us-led push for much closer ties has run into reservations from european allies , notably germany , france and turkey , which have rejected any question of a full merger between isaf and oef .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german education getting better grades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more college students these days , but still not enough a new comparative study released tuesday showed germany has made some progress in revamping and improving its educational system .
however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.09.2005 looking at germany from the outside großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman has seen a different , modern germany just in time to coincide with the german election , us philosopher susan neiman has written a new book about outsiders ' views of germany .
she and other intellectuals draw some rather surprising conclusions . " what if germany is already in the middle of reinventing itself , but the process is only recognizable from afar ? "
that 's one of the central questions in neiman 's new book . after studying at harvard and berlin 's free university , teaching at yale and tel aviv universities , neiman , who has lived in berlin for the better part of two decades .
she now directs the einstein forum in potsdam , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars . her ability to look at germany both from an insider 's and outsider 's perspective encouraged her to write her latest book , in which she collects views from foreign intellectuals about germany . core changes according to neiman , three core changes took place during the last few years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan neiman " first , there has been a significant change in the politics of memory , " she writes .
" this happened over time , but has really been continuously promoted by the current government . " the second change is a different approach towards foreigners after the new immigration law put in place by the red-green government .
there 's a certain cosmopolitanism that can be felt abroad .
germany is an open country . " third , there 's the foreign policy .
schröder 's rejection of the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- has played a big role - much more so abroad than within germany . " a political intervention an outsider 's perspective is sometimes useful in a democracy , where opinions and moods reign supreme .
that 's why neiman has called her book , which was published in german , " fremde sehen anders " -lrb- " strangers see things differently " -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green foreign minister joschka fischer and social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder have n't done all that bad , according to neiman " the book is a political intervention , because i felt the debate surrounding the election was rather one sided , " neiman said .
" i could n't accept a consensus void of discussion that said : red-green will lose and people say they deserve it even though no one likes the alternative . " it 's this view that neiman wanted to question by presenting people with a mirror held up from the outside - simply because her own circle of liberal friends and colleagues had a different perspective on german politics . presenting the other side neiman 's book is n't an analysis of previous german governments .
it offers voices from africa , britain , israel , sweden , turkey and the us - voices from people who have lived and done research in germany . a view from the outside is justified , but also driving by special interests , as is the case with any view . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bright times ahead for germany ?
neiman 's collection of voices represents a resistance to any kind of neoconservatism . " it was not my intention to present an objective review that will be always valid , " she said .
" i simply wanted to present the other side that never gets talked about . " michael köhler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de susan neiman susan neiman is the director of potsdam 's einstein forum , which encourages the exchange of ideas in open workshops , lectures and seminars .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 unity report highlights progress , problems großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work never stops on mending the east-west divide a carefully timed report ahead of sunday 's elections praised the progress made in eastern germany under schröder 's leadership , despite the glaring economic disparity between both halves of the country . on oct .
3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

" this is a general assembly like no other , " new york police commissioner ray kelly told bbc . it 's equally significant in terms of content .
un secretary general kofi annan has warned that the un faces a fork in the road and needs bold action . on tuesday , he presented a 35-page draft package of reforms that ended weeks of deadlocked negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council " i think it is a success , " he said .
" we 've got a good document .
we did n't get everything we wanted and i think we can build on it . "
he admitted the draft failed to address non-proliferation and disarmament , while other sticking points included the creation of a new human rights body , the definition of terrorism and enlargement of the un security council . meanwhile , john bolton , us ambassador to the un , took no pains to hide the limits of a reform he said would lead to " a somewhat improved un . " " it would be wrong to claim more than is realistic and accurate about what these reforms are , " he told reporters .
" they represent steps forward , but this is not the alpha and the omega , and we never thought it would be . " he also said the reform process " goes to the question , which is a much longer-term question , as to whether the culture of decision making at the un is the most effective for the organization . " step toward basic reform " what we can say now is that we will have a document that will reflect what is politically possible right now among 191 members , " gunter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , told the new york times .
" it may not be the great reform idea that -lrb- un secretary general -rrb- kofi annan put into the world two years ago and might not meet with the excitement of all member states and of the press , but it will be an important step in the direction of a basic reform of the un . " the draft document addresses topics that include the creation of a new human rights council , ways to increase economic development and reduce poverty and a un management overhaul . in many cases impasses were resolved by substituting specific goals with broad statements of principle , according to the newspaper .
annan 's centerpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns the original reform plan was meant to be the centerpiece of annan 's ambitious plan to reform the world body on its 60th anniversary .
enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .
this plan would correct what they perceive as a historical injustice that has left them as the only continent not represented on the security council .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.09.2005 german apprenticeships tough all round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands-on experience is the key to germany 's training system competition for school apprenticeships in germany is so fierce that nearly 170,000 hopefuls will end their job search empty-handed .
yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .
at the same time , they study classroom skills related to their profession .
it is a time-tested route into the german job market for people in a wide array of vocations , from carpentry to graphic design to office administration .
yet it doesn ’ t all work out perfectly .
the numbers of lehrstellen , as these official , paid apprenticeships are called , are closely watched and reported on , since they mirror the health of the job market .
this year , according to the german labor agency , the country is short some 169,000 apprenticeships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee at bayer so the dropout figures put out by the ministry for education and research job training study may come as a surprise to some .
according to the study , some 21.9 percent of all apprentices throw in the towel before their time is up .
most , but not all , of them give up during the first several months of the apprenticeship , when the experience is considered a trial period on both sides .
peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .
" you get someone in a kitchen who is learning to be a cook , and he wants to make wonderful dishes .
but there are a lot of pots to wash and a lot of potatoes to peel , " liebernickel said .
" it 's not a time in their lives for leadership . "
lacking in skills another issue , one hotly debated on the political stage , is the skills high and technical school students possess .
" sometimes they can ’ t do basic math .
they can ’ t write a sentence , " liebernickel said .
on top of that , there are social considerations - applicants should learn how to behave in an interview .
and " if they are going to be late , they should know to call first and say why , " said vera lange , who heads up the apprenticeships and further training department at the cologne chamber of commerce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apprentice in an auto workshop carsten israel of the hamburg foundation for jobs said his pilot program - which has been underway for four years now and has funding through 2006 - works with schools and employers to prepare technical school students for the world of work .
the foundation tries to assess a student ’ s strengths and interests , then figure out which jobs would best suit him or her , and finally , help with the detailed and often brand new tasks associated with actual job hunting .
for israel , the idea that students today are less prepared for the world of work than they once were , is " an unfortunate generalization .

" this is a general assembly like no other , " new york police commissioner ray kelly told bbc . it 's equally significant in terms of content .
un secretary general kofi annan has warned that the un faces a fork in the road and needs bold action . on tuesday , he presented a 35-page draft package of reforms that ended weeks of deadlocked negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council " i think it is a success , " he said .
" we 've got a good document .
we did n't get everything we wanted and i think we can build on it . "
he admitted the draft failed to address non-proliferation and disarmament , while other sticking points included the creation of a new human rights body , the definition of terrorism and enlargement of the un security council . meanwhile , john bolton , us ambassador to the un , took no pains to hide the limits of a reform he said would lead to " a somewhat improved un . " " it would be wrong to claim more than is realistic and accurate about what these reforms are , " he told reporters .
" they represent steps forward , but this is not the alpha and the omega , and we never thought it would be . " he also said the reform process " goes to the question , which is a much longer-term question , as to whether the culture of decision making at the un is the most effective for the organization . " step toward basic reform " what we can say now is that we will have a document that will reflect what is politically possible right now among 191 members , " gunter pleuger , germany 's ambassador to the un , told the new york times .
" it may not be the great reform idea that -lrb- un secretary general -rrb- kofi annan put into the world two years ago and might not meet with the excitement of all member states and of the press , but it will be an important step in the direction of a basic reform of the un . " the draft document addresses topics that include the creation of a new human rights council , ways to increase economic development and reduce poverty and a un management overhaul . in many cases impasses were resolved by substituting specific goals with broad statements of principle , according to the newspaper .
annan 's centerpiece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american ambassador to nato nicholas burns the original reform plan was meant to be the centerpiece of annan 's ambitious plan to reform the world body on its 60th anniversary .
enlarging the powerful , 15-member security council was supposed to reflect the 21st century 's new balance of forces , enshrining the enhanced status of economic powerhouses germany and japan - the world war ii losers - and the emerging power of india and brazil .
but the plan , which was to have been endorsed by world leaders at their summit this week , seems to have fallen victim to the competing egos and interests of rival nations . the most promising expansion plan came in a draft introduced to the un general assembly in july by the so-called g4 : brazil , germany , india and japan .
it called for boosting council membership to 25 , with six new permanent , non-veto-wielding seats - the g4 nations plus two from africa - and four non-permanent seats .
power to veto a sticking point but the african union , led by algeria and egypt , rejected the g4 proposal and pushed instead for their own draft calling for two permanent security council seats for africa - with veto power - as well as five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa .
this plan would correct what they perceive as a historical injustice that has left them as the only continent not represented on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that demand for veto power was generally viewed as unrealistic by the five current permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
early on , the united states warned it would reject any major expansion of the council , stating its preference for only two additional permanent seats , including one for japan .
in an attempt to reconcile these differences , at a july meeting in london , the g4 proposed a plan by which africa would drop its demand for veto power in exchange for a fifth non-permanent seat .
yet as the united states and china signaled opposition to the g4 blueprint , the africans decided at a summit in addis ababa in august to reject the compromise deal offered by the g4 and backed by nigeria , the current au chairman . dw staff -lrb- aal / win / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

he pointed out that it took korean carmakers hyundai and daewoo " a dozen years to make attractive cars with acceptable quality . "

he expects the chinese to have about 1.5 percent of the european market in 2010 .
industry already weakened a new scrum touched off by cut-price competition is the last thing carmakers need .
while there has been a slight uptick in the german market , manufacturers are still grappling with lackluster sales growth , high raw material prices and margin-denting incentives .
industry executives will also have to consider the impact of record fuel prices that sooner or later will make consumers think twice about splashing out on fuel-thirsty suvs and high-powered masters of the autobahn - like mercedes and bmw - which are the auto world 's real money spinners .
chinese carmakers have the support of the government in beijing , as china 's ambition is to overtake germany as the world 's third largest automobile producer , after the united states and japan .
" the chinese carmakers are coming , but it will be difficult for them to find a place as quickly as hyundai did in the past , " the president of japan 's mitsubishi , osamu masuko , told journalists .
" not only because the technologies never stop improving but also because the political climate will not be strongly in its favor , " he added , alluding to the recent battle between the european union and china over textile imports . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de high fuel prices push alternative engines record prices at gas stations caused in part by the devastating effects of hurricane katrina have knocked discussion in germany about alternative engines into high gear ahead of this month 's auto show .

that 's good news and could help ignite economic growth , say experts . germany 's high scores on a recent report by the world bank on the business environment of different countries is a sign of hope that the european union 's strongest economy is on the path of growth .
the world bank report called doing business in 2006 describes the often pejorative effects of government regulations across various countries .
by measuring the time and cost associated with government requirements , it ranks 155 countries in terms of their business-friendliness .
new zealand was in the top position , followed by singapore and the united states .
germany came in at number 19 on the easy-to-do-business index .
it also ranked as the fifth most reform-friendly country in the world .
a step on the right path ?
this could be interpreted as good news for the current government , which has pushed through a series of controversial welfare and labor reforms designed to spur the economy by making employment laws more flexible .
the report 's lead author , simon djankov , said the report puts a positive spin on germany 's growth prospects because of successful attempts to put reforms into place in the past year .
" as a result we record germany as one of the top reformers in the business environment in the world - especially in areas like the labor market , business , courts and contract enforcement , " he said .
such far-reaching reforms have been shown to work wonders elsewhere after a year or so .
" so germany 's certainly on the right track , " djankov added .
other top scorers also on the right track are other top scorers , including the eastern european countries slovakia and georgia , as well as fast growing asian countries such as vietnam .
serbia-montenegro was also ranked a top reformer , having made improvements in almost all areas - from making it easier to start a business to improving labor-market flexibility and simplifying commercial dispute resolution .
ranked lower in the report were many countries in africa , south america and the middle east which continue to discourage business activity with heavy legal burdens and miles of red tape .
for example , in mozambique it takes 153 days to start a very basic company -lrb- versus two in canada -rrb- .
in syria it takes over $ 60,000 -lrb- more than 10 times the average annual income -rrb- to start a small company .
such bureaucratic slow-downs ultimately stem from excessive regulation , which has accumulated over time . if these cumbersome processes are not improved , the offshoot is an increase in unemployment and less economic growth . sam edmonds -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no miracle cure for german economy for an election that is being fought on economic issues , many germans seem to believe that the fortunes of europe 's biggest economy will not change even if conservative challenger angela merkel wins the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.09.2005 opinion : diluted , but still effective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has n't quite gone where annan wanted to go a far cry from the original plan put forward by secretary general kofi annan , the un 's reform blueprint has been diluted beyond recognition - according to its critics .
dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .
-lrb- sept .
14 , 2005 -rrb- germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

dw 's klaus dahmann wonders if they have a point . it definitely is n't the milestone many were hoping for .
but even though kofi annan 's original ambitions have been considerably scaled down in the course of negotiations , the basic outline of his sweeping reform plan is still intact . the proposed peacebuilding commission is in there , and so is the permanent human rights council intended to replace the ineffective human rights commission . the un 's millennium development goals strategy is also addressed , even if specific quotas on increasing development aid are so far absent . us resistance admittedly , these are smaller steps than annan wanted to see taken - but they 're still steps in the right direction . given the draconian reform proposals the us was pressing for , as well as the broad front of resistance from various states , it 's a perfectly acceptable result . the inevitable disappointment aside - which is partially due to the frustratingly long build-up - one should bear in mind that it 's still the supporters of a strengthened united nations who have retained the upper hand .
as we 've come to expect from the organization , progress is slow - but sure . falling short of expectations in other words , the lesson everyone has learned is that national interests lead nowhere .
washington would have preferred to see the final draft watered down to a three-page summary of us foreign policy , with top priority going to the war on terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john r. bolton us ambassador to the un john bolton fought for his corner tooth and nail , but ultimately , he did n't get his way . other parties , such as germany , were nursing high hopes for a permanent seat on the security council .
but now the negotiations that dominated attention earlier this year on expansion of the security council have been put off until december , and a decision seems unlikely in the foreseeable future . glaring ommissions and obviously , there are many omissions .
the questions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are conspicuously absent - as is any mention of the international criminal court , which is , after all , a body the un deserves to be proud of . but when all is said and done , the formulations fleshed out by the politicians and diplomats in new york are less important than what actually happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium development goals are a case in point .
increased development aid quotas are n't enough - the main thing is that the funds go where they 're needed .
that 's where developing nations have to do their bit , and guarantee that governments are carefully scrutinized for any underhand syphoning off of aid . actions , after all , speak louder than words . klaus dahmann -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de agreement reached as un summit opens the united nations general assembly has approved a compromised reform package that will be the basis for discussion at the un 's 60th anniversary summit starting wednesday .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .
he also said he committed the crime out of concern for his nephew 's future . " i killed my sister , and i acted alone , " said 19-year-old ayhan s. via his lawyer .
in a show of remorse , he said " today , i can can no longer understand my actions . " the two other men , aged 24 and 26 , said they were not involved with the slaying of the sister . a western lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 . her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and sürücü subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .
they believe that ayhan .
s. and the third brother then went to their sister 's house and persuaded her to go with them under false pretences .
ayhan s. then shot her , while his brother was an accessory to the crime . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

yet one-fifth of those who do get placed wind up dropping out . some employers ’ complaints : trainees show up late , if at all .
they dress inappropriately .
they don ’ t know basic math and can ’ t string together a sentence .
the trainees see it differently .
employers are too strict ; the work is dull .
or too taxing , and the hours stink .
it was n't what they expected .
it 's a classic disconnect between employer and employee .
and it leads to around 20 percent of all the hard-won training positions in germany coming to an untimely close .
a dual system first , some background : germany has what is known as a " dual system " of education , where graduates of high schools and vocational schools take an official , paid apprenticeship , usually around three years in length .

one has already admitted sole responsibility for her murder . the death of 23-year-old hatin sürücü attracted nationwide attention after she was shot dead with three bullets to the head at a berlin bus stop last february . when three of sürücü 's 5 brothers were charged with the killing , the case triggered angry debate about immigrant integration and democratic values within germany 's muslim community . guilty as the trial began , the youngest of the three brothers gave a statement saying that he killed his sister because of her lifestyle . sürücü , who was divorced and lived with her five-year-old son , had made choices that he believed brought dishonor upon the family .
he also said he committed the crime out of concern for his nephew 's future . " i killed my sister , and i acted alone , " said 19-year-old ayhan s. via his lawyer .
in a show of remorse , he said " today , i can can no longer understand my actions . " the two other men , aged 24 and 26 , said they were not involved with the slaying of the sister . a western lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to prosecutors , hatin sürücü grew up in germany and was forced into a marriage with a cousin in turkey in 1998 . her son was born in berlin in may 1999 , and sürücü subsequently refused to return to turkey .
six months later , she moved out of her parents home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative family . her youngest brother told the court he had visited his sister at home before walking with her to the nearby bus-stop .
when she defended her way of life , he pulled out the gun he said he had bought off a russian , and killed her . " i could n't take it , " he said . but according to the prosecution 's version , it was actually the oldest brother who procured the weapon .
they believe that ayhan .

peeling potatoes for wolfgang liebernickel , who is in charge of training and apprenticeships for the german association for mid-sized companies -lrb- bvmw -rrb- , the problem starts in the schools .
the biggest problem that he sees is that young people need to be able to learn how to gracefully occupy the lower rungs of the workforce ladder .

" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trainee in the deutsche welle kitchen lange has a docket on her desk about someone who wanted to terminate an apprentice .
" the apprentice was repeatedly sick but didn ’ t even bother calling .
they just sent a text message . "
the dropout rate is really upsetting , she said .
" it 's difficult for the young person , who will have a hard time finding something new in such a short time .
and it 's bad for the companies , because all the good candidates are already taken , " lange said .
solution : internships ?
a main reason for the high dropout rate , lange said , is that students " hear a good name , like ' new media ' and it sounds exciting .
but then they get into it and decide it is too hard .
or its really boring . "
lange suggested students try to do internships during their high school years to get a better idea of the realities of the job .

however , the country is still far from the top of the class . the study , compiled by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , offered some comfort to german education experts , still reeling from the disastrous results of the oecd-authored pisa educational study in 2003 . that report handed down a damning verdict regarding germany 's school system , pointing out " grave erroneous trends " that were a results of years of faulty education policy . this time , the grade was somewhat better and changes in the educational system seem to have turned the tide somewhat , although experts are quick to point out that the report is not all rosy and that germany still lags behind many other western european nations in both education investment and scholastic performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas schleicher " in many areas , it 's going in the right direction , " said andreas schleicher , head of the indicators and analysis division at the oecd 's directorate for education and author of the study . but he added : " we see , for example , countries like iceland , norway , denmark , sweden and belgium , which invest more than 6 percent of their gdp in education .
germany , with only 4.4 percent , is in 20th place . " good news , bad news the good news is that the number of people embarking on university careers rose from 28 to 38 percent in the period from 1998 to 2004 .
however , the average among oecd countries is 53 percent .
the number of college graduates also rose over that time , from 16 to 19.5 percent .
again , though , in comparison with other oecd countries , where the figure is 32.2 percent , germany is still behind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn , minister for education and research education minister edelgard bulmahn made the most out of the positive aspects of the results , especially given that germans go to the polls on sunday in federal elections .
she pointed out that one area that the oecd has much praise for - expansion of the number of schools that kept students for the entire day instead of the half day , which is the norm - was an initiative of the current administration . " the latest results show that the number of college students coming from lower-income families has risen from 13 to 17 percent , " she added , referring to earlier findings that children from educated , wealthier families tended to go to college , while kids from less-privileged backgrounds did not . another point in germany 's favor was the fact that among countries popular for foreign students , germany ranks third , behind the us and great britain . a long road ahead however , study author schleicher told german public television on tuesday that the country still had a long road ahead of it before becoming a " knowledge society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the education and sciences sector trade union , gew , warned that a stable trend upwards has n't yet been established .
it pointed out that there was still a decrease in the general population of university graduates , a unique development among oecd countries . " according to current growth rates -lrb- of numbers of university graduates -rrb- , it will take another 30 years before we reach numbers similar to those of finland , " marianne demmer , deputy gew chair , told ap , referring to the country that took home an a + in the last pisa education study . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany to reform pre-school education a new government report released thursday demands reforms to the pre-school education system , among them improving the training of teachers in kindergartens - a situation that 's badly in need of change in germany .

3 , germany will mark the 15th anniversary of reunification .
but politicians and social scientists agree equal living conditions in both halves of the once-divided country remain wishful thinking .
only a few of them would say so openly ahead of the polls on sunday , however .
and german transport minister manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has special responsibility for eastern germany 's economic development , stressed the positive in a report on the state of german unity tuesday .
in his report , stolpe said the inner-german unification process had made big strides under the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens .
he pointed to an ultra-modern telecommunications infrastructure in the east , and added that two-thirds of 17 huge road modernization and expansion schemes had already been completed .
seeking financial independence the more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- spent on road infrastructure improvement in the post-communist eastern federal states amounted to no less than 40 percent of overall federal investments there , stolpe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless in east germany " we want to see to it that by 2020 the eastern german economy is competitive enough to advance independently from financial transfers , " stolpe said .
" that would be a major achievement in itself .
i hasten to add that we ’ ll still have regional differences , concerning economic performance .
but then such differences are also in evidence among the western federal states . "
top-notch investors stolpe emphasized that eastern regions and communities enjoy a good deal of planning security , with a so-called interstate solidarity pact having been prolonged until 2019 .
under this pact , the east - particularly the most depressed regions there - will receive about 150 billion euros in federal funds for modernization projects .
a program to promote small and medium sized enterprises in the east is beginning to yield tangible results , stolpe said .
he also noted that the east had managed to attract a number of top-notch investors , including carmaker bmw , postal courier dhl , and microchip producer amd .
stolpe did acknowledge continued problems in the labor market .
" where industrial locations survived in the east , we ’ ve seen an accompanying process of modernization and rationalization to enhance competitiveness , " he said .
" but this also means that one such unit is now doing what seven units did before , resulting in a massive loss of jobs . "
high unemployment indeed , stolpe ’ s predominantly positive assessment of the progress in eastern german can be put into jarring perspective by a look at unemployment statistics .
the number of jobless in the east is still twice as high as that in the more affluent west .
as a result , well over two million easterners have moved westward in pursuit of jobs since 1991 .
a panel of experts last year called economic development in the east " an unmitigated disaster , " as astronomic sums had , in its view , been spent indiscriminately .
the panel still believes germany ’ s eastern half should be turned into a special economic zone , offering lower taxes and a greater degree of labor market deregulation to attract more investors .
however , minister stolpe on tuesday reiterated his view that such a move would be counter-productive , as structural problems were now also increasingly occurring in various areas in the west of the country . hardy graupner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : breaching the east-west economic divide when the german cabinet presented its annual report on the state of german unity wednesday , it reached the unexpected conclusion that the economic gap between east and west has , in fact , begun to close . -lrb- sept .

the ulster volunteer force was formed in 1966 to combat what it saw as a rise in irish nationalism centred on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 easter rising .

it had been formed a few months earlier with the express intention of executing " mercilessly and without hesitation " known ira men .
their first three victims , a protestant woman and two catholic men , had no connections with the ira .
it was the murder of barman peter ward , the third victim , which brought the uvf and its leader gusty spence to public attention .
spence was convicted of ward 's murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison .
the new uvf opposed the liberal reforms being introduced by pm o 'neill .
in march and april 1969 they bombed water and electricity installations as part of a broader political campaign to force o 'neill to resign .

the northern ireland secretary , peter hain , has announced that the government no longer recognises the ulster volunteer force -lrb- uvf -rrb- as being on ceasefire .
but what exactly is the uvf ?
the ulster volunteer force was formed in 1966 to combat what it saw as a rise in irish nationalism centred on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 easter rising .
uvf murals can be found on many streets in n ireland it adopted the name and symbols of the original uvf , the movement founded in 1912 by sir edward carson to fight against home rule .
many uvf men joined the 36th ulster division of the british army and died in large numbers during the battle of the somme in july 1916 .
fifty years later , the prime minister of northern ireland , captain terence o 'neill , would rush back from a commemorative service at the somme to ban the uvf .
it had been formed a few months earlier with the express intention of executing " mercilessly and without hesitation " known ira men .
their first three victims , a protestant woman and two catholic men , had no connections with the ira .
it was the murder of barman peter ward , the third victim , which brought the uvf and its leader gusty spence to public attention .
spence was convicted of ward 's murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison .
the new uvf opposed the liberal reforms being introduced by pm o 'neill .
in march and april 1969 they bombed water and electricity installations as part of a broader political campaign to force o 'neill to resign .
the bombings were blamed on the ira .
o 'neill resigned at the end of april .
according to the book lost lives , between 1966 and 1999 the uvf and an affiliate group , the red hand commando , killed 547 people .
the lvf broke away from the uvf in the mid-1990s many were killed in high profile attacks .
in december 1971 they planted a bomb at mcgurk 's bar in belfast killing 15 .
by the mid-70s a vicious uvf unit known as the shankill butchers was engaged in horrific sectarian killings .
in may 1974 the uvf was suspected of planting bombs in dublin and monaghan killing 33 people and in 1975 they shot dead three members of the miami show band .
in october 1975 the uvf was undermined when soldiers and police swooped on houses in belfast and east antrim and arrested 26 men .
the following march they were sentenced to a total of 700 years in prison .
the police got more evidence in 1983 when a uvf commander turned informer .
in october 1994 , the combined loyalist military command , which included the uvf , called a ceasefire .
gusty spence made the announcement , expressing " abject and true remorse " to all innocent victims of loyalist violence .
david ervine leads the uvf 's political wing , the pup the uvf 's political wing , the progressive unionist party , played a prominent role in the peace process and supported the 1998 belfast agreement .
since 1996 , the uvf has been embroiled in a feud with the loyalist volunteer force .
in august 2000 a murderous feud broke out between the uvf and the uda 's c company , led by johnny adair , on belfast 's lower shankill road .
by the time a truce was negotiated in december 2000 , seven men had died as a result of the feud and hundreds of families were displaced .

motorists who dash out to " top up " their tanks are not just behaving irrationally , but undermining their own interests , it says .
many papers carry pictures of empty forecourts as garages across the country ran out of petrol .
the daily express described scenes of near hysteria on forecourts .
energy future the independent talks of " panic at the pumps " in the run-up to the planned fuel protests .
several of the papers support the chancellor 's refusal to cut fuel duty , but also consider the future of energy .
the times says gordon brown should embrace nuclear as the safest , cleanest and most efficient alternative option .
the independent says he should use the income generated from higher fuel prices to promote a more green british economy and calls for more cycle lanes .
lukewarm spirit the chancellor 's appearance at the tuc yesterday gives plenty of fodder for the political sketch writers .
andrew gimson - in the daily telegraph - says it would be hard to think of an occasion when a major politician was received in such a lukewarm spirit .
" delegates were too demoralised to boo mr brown , but too honest to cheer him . "
at the un , the guardian predicts that , once again the body 's own expectations will not be met , and the financial times notes a missed opportunity .
ashes parade england 's triumphant cricketers feature on most of the front pages .
andrew flintoff is shown red-eyed from a long night of celebration in the sun and the daily mirror .
and there are many images of the london victory parade .
david robson - writing in the daily express - describes a " proud , patriotic , occasion " .
but the daily mail lambasts the sale of the broadcasting rights for test cricket to sky as " labour 's great cricket sell-out " .

the report mistakenly included information about the girl , whose attacker received a lengthy sentence .
but the girl 's mother , who was delivered an apology by hand , says she is still not satisfied .
now the independent police complaints commission -lrb- ipcc -rrb- is to investigate how the girl 's identity was made public .
an ipcc investigation team will visit to north wales police hq on wednesday after the force referred the matter to them on tuesday night .
ipcc commissioner tom davies said the priority was the welfare of the victim concerned and that they had asked the force " to ensure it does everything it can to stop the victim 's identity being published " .
they 've got no right doing this - putting my daughter 's name in a document that can be seen by the public mother of sex victim " however , this is a serious incident and i will ensure that a full and thorough investigation takes place .
we will find out what happened and why it happened , " mr davies said .
the girl was named in richard brunstrom 's regular update to police authority members even though under law victims of sex crimes are entitled to anonymity .
everybody who received a copy of the report to friday 's meeting , including press and authority members have been asked to destroy it .
the force is also reviewing its procedures for checking reports .
the girl 's mother told the bbc she felt angry and let down by the police .
she said she would now take up the matter with the prime minister and her mp .
she said that if anyone else , a journalist for example , had revealed her daughter 's name , that person would face prosecution for contempt of court .
" -lrb- the apology -rrb- does n't mean much to me to be honest , " she added .
" the thing is whether they stop it happening again , it should not have happened in the first place . "
traumatic experiences conservative mp for clwyd west david jones , said it was the " honourable thing " for the force to have referred the matter to the ipcc .
" it 's important that everybody should be satisfied that the matter is fully investigated and treated with the seriousness it merits , " he said .
" the whole purpose of the law is to protect vulnerable people who have undergone traumatic experiences .
" it 's hard to see how an efficient police force could commit such a fundamental mistake . "

iptv -lrb- internet protocol tv -rrb- , as it is known , is a budding area that is exciting telecoms and media companies .
within a decade , says the report from lovelace consulting and informitv , tv delivered to sets over the net will be an established way to receive content .
tv will be much more web-like , with millions of shows to download .
within five years , the authors predict , many households will have their tv piped through a satellite dish , rooftop aerial or cable network , and through a broadband phone line .
tvs will be hooked up to set-top boxes which are in turn hooked up to the broadband pipe too .
the broadcast and on-demand programmes it will be able to receive will be in standard as well as high-definition formats .
' limitless selection ' " new players will exploit the disruptive power of the internet and change the form and function of television forever , " said dr william cooper , co-author of the report . "
there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment " jean-christophe dessange , cisco " broadband television will ultimately adopt the attributes of the web , providing access to an almost limitless selection of programmes . "
iptv does not rely on the limited broadcast network to transmit programmes .
it used internet technology so there is a limitless capacity for more programmes .
up until now , the report suggests , net-based innovations and developments in digital tv were more or less separate worlds .
but now , the two are very much converging and some even suggest that the majority of video and audio content will be received in households over the net in the longer term , according to the report .
in your hands the technology is currently more widespread in the rest europe than in the uk because of faster and cheaper broadband .
but this is changing as uk net service providers up the minimum speeds of connections and prices fall .
ntl , for instance , is to boost the basic entry level for its broadband subscribers to 10mbps next year .
" the ' pull ' of broadband network television will replace the ' push ' of traditional broadcast television , " explained co-author graham lovelace .
this means that the control of what programmes and content is available to watch will move out of the hands of the traditional broadcasters and into the hands of the viewer .
traditional broadcasters have been wrestling with with technologies such as pvrs -lrb- personal video recorders -rrb- which allow viewers to take more control over what and when they watch .
but iptv has the potential to disrupt that even more .
hundreds of different programmes could be sent to different homes at the same time .
broadband delivery of tv will also change what viewers will be able to do while watching tv .
it provides the perfect platform for genuinely interactive television , according to the report .
cornerstone year jean-christophe dessange , broadband entertainment development manager for networking giant cisco , told the bbc news website that the future possibilities for iptv are extremely exciting .
" i believe in europe , 2006 will be a cornerstone , a changing year , " he said .
" there is not one telco that does not ask me about iptv today , and they were the same ones that two years ago that told me it would never work , " according to mr dessange .
new and more efficient video encoding techniques - the mpeg4 standard - allow for cost effective transport of video .
improved infrastructure , as well as the uptake and speed of broadband technologies to deliver it , have also helped .
" there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment , " says mr dessange .
one of the key areas in the next decade will be interactivity .
but it is not just the interactive tv experience that uk digital viewers have now .
cbeebies , the bbc 's toddler 's channel , as well as sports programmes , have successfully experimented with itv .
but increasingly , with the latest video encoding technology , viewers will be able to trigger events while they watch video .
or you could choose just to focus on one participant in a tv interview .
if you watch a programme and see a watch you like you could feasibly select it and buy it online while still watching your show .
but the real power of iptv could be in its convenience and range of choice which the viewer will subsequently have , such as micro-local content .
people could tune into live traffic camera streams , or film their own football teams to put on a local iptv channel , as they do in norway .
in italy , one man uses iptv to deliver news to the rest of his apartment block ; another films himself having breakfast with his blow-up doll .
whatever the content , mr dessange says it is exciting that there are many more new distribution channels .
" people are using bittorrent and portals , allowing you to have access to movies , yahoo , google , msn .
all those guys are grabbing audiences on the net .
" this is at the expense of classic media . "
it is a challenge that traditional media need to take seriously , says mr dessange , because people only have a specific time period to watch tv , and they are spending some of that time online instead .

iptv -lrb- internet protocol tv -rrb- , as it is known , is a budding area that is exciting telecoms and media companies .
within a decade , says the report from lovelace consulting and informitv , tv delivered to sets over the net will be an established way to receive content .
tv will be much more web-like , with millions of shows to download .
within five years , the authors predict , many households will have their tv piped through a satellite dish , rooftop aerial or cable network , and through a broadband phone line .
tvs will be hooked up to set-top boxes which are in turn hooked up to the broadband pipe too .
the broadcast and on-demand programmes it will be able to receive will be in standard as well as high-definition formats .
' limitless selection ' " new players will exploit the disruptive power of the internet and change the form and function of television forever , " said dr william cooper , co-author of the report .
there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment jean-christophe dessange , cisco " broadband television will ultimately adopt the attributes of the web , providing access to an almost limitless selection of programmes . "
iptv does not rely on the limited broadcast network to transmit programmes .
it used internet technology so there is a limitless capacity for more programmes .
up until now , the report suggests , net-based innovations and developments in digital tv were more or less separate worlds .
but now , the two are very much converging and some even suggest that the majority of video and audio content will be received in households over the net in the longer term , according to the report .
in your hands the technology is currently more widespread in the rest europe than in the uk because of faster and cheaper broadband .
but this is changing as uk net service providers up the minimum speeds of connections and prices fall .
ntl , for instance , is to boost the basic entry level for its broadband subscribers to 10mbps next year .
our tvs will become a lot more interesting bits of kit " the ' pull ' of broadband network television will replace the ' push ' of traditional broadcast television , " explained co-author graham lovelace .
this means that the control of what programmes and content is available to watch will move out of the hands of the traditional broadcasters and into the hands of the viewer .
traditional broadcasters have been wrestling with with technologies such as pvrs -lrb- personal video recorders -rrb- which allow viewers to take more control over what and when they watch .
but iptv has the potential to disrupt that even more .
hundreds of different programmes could be sent to different homes at the same time .
broadband delivery of tv will also change what viewers will be able to do while watching tv .
it provides the perfect platform for genuinely interactive television , according to the report .
cornerstone year jean-christophe dessange , broadband entertainment development manager for networking giant cisco , told the bbc news website that the future possibilities for iptv are extremely exciting .
" i believe in europe , 2006 will be a cornerstone , a changing year , " he said .
" there is not one telco that does not ask me about iptv today , and they were the same ones that two years ago that told me it would never work , " according to mr dessange .
new and more efficient video encoding techniques - the mpeg4 standard - allow for cost effective transport of video .
improved infrastructure , as well as the uptake and speed of broadband technologies to deliver it , have also helped .
" there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment , " says mr dessange .

or you could choose just to focus on one participant in a tv interview .
if you watch a programme and see a watch you like you could feasibly select it and buy it online while still watching your show .
but the real power of iptv could be in its convenience and range of choice which the viewer will subsequently have , such as micro-local content .
people could tune into live traffic camera streams , or film their own football teams to put on a local iptv channel , as they do in norway .
in italy , one man uses iptv to deliver news to the rest of his apartment block ; another films himself having breakfast with his blow-up doll .

iptv -lrb- internet protocol tv -rrb- , as it is known , is a budding area that is exciting telecoms and media companies .
within a decade , says the report from lovelace consulting and informitv , tv delivered to sets over the net will be an established way to receive content .
tv will be much more web-like , with millions of shows to download .
within five years , the authors predict , many households will have their tv piped through a satellite dish , rooftop aerial or cable network , and through a broadband phone line .
tvs will be hooked up to set-top boxes which are in turn hooked up to the broadband pipe too .
the broadcast and on-demand programmes it will be able to receive will be in standard as well as high-definition formats .
' limitless selection ' " new players will exploit the disruptive power of the internet and change the form and function of television forever , " said dr william cooper , co-author of the report .
there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment jean-christophe dessange , cisco " broadband television will ultimately adopt the attributes of the web , providing access to an almost limitless selection of programmes . "
iptv does not rely on the limited broadcast network to transmit programmes .
it used internet technology so there is a limitless capacity for more programmes .
up until now , the report suggests , net-based innovations and developments in digital tv were more or less separate worlds .
but now , the two are very much converging and some even suggest that the majority of video and audio content will be received in households over the net in the longer term , according to the report .
in your hands the technology is currently more widespread in the rest europe than in the uk because of faster and cheaper broadband .
but this is changing as uk net service providers up the minimum speeds of connections and prices fall .
ntl , for instance , is to boost the basic entry level for its broadband subscribers to 10mbps next year .
our tvs will become a lot more interesting bits of kit " the ' pull ' of broadband network television will replace the ' push ' of traditional broadcast television , " explained co-author graham lovelace .
this means that the control of what programmes and content is available to watch will move out of the hands of the traditional broadcasters and into the hands of the viewer .
traditional broadcasters have been wrestling with with technologies such as pvrs -lrb- personal video recorders -rrb- which allow viewers to take more control over what and when they watch .
but iptv has the potential to disrupt that even more .
hundreds of different programmes could be sent to different homes at the same time .
broadband delivery of tv will also change what viewers will be able to do while watching tv .
it provides the perfect platform for genuinely interactive television , according to the report .
cornerstone year jean-christophe dessange , broadband entertainment development manager for networking giant cisco , told the bbc news website that the future possibilities for iptv are extremely exciting .
" i believe in europe , 2006 will be a cornerstone , a changing year , " he said .
" there is not one telco that does not ask me about iptv today , and they were the same ones that two years ago that told me it would never work , " according to mr dessange .
new and more efficient video encoding techniques - the mpeg4 standard - allow for cost effective transport of video .
improved infrastructure , as well as the uptake and speed of broadband technologies to deliver it , have also helped .
" there is a willingness of tv broadcasters to extend their reach and they are joining with telcos in that environment , " says mr dessange .
one of the key areas in the next decade will be interactivity .
but it is not just the interactive tv experience that uk digital viewers have now .
cbeebies , the bbc 's toddler 's channel , as well as sports programmes , have successfully experimented with itv .
but increasingly , with the latest video encoding technology , viewers will be able to trigger events while they watch video .
or you could choose just to focus on one participant in a tv interview .
if you watch a programme and see a watch you like you could feasibly select it and buy it online while still watching your show .
but the real power of iptv could be in its convenience and range of choice which the viewer will subsequently have , such as micro-local content .
people could tune into live traffic camera streams , or film their own football teams to put on a local iptv channel , as they do in norway .
in italy , one man uses iptv to deliver news to the rest of his apartment block ; another films himself having breakfast with his blow-up doll .
whatever the content , mr dessange says it is exciting that there are many more new distribution channels .
" people are using bittorrent and portals , allowing you to have access to movies , yahoo , google , msn .
all those guys are grabbing audiences on the net .
" this is at the expense of classic media . "
it is a challenge that traditional media need to take seriously , says mr dessange , because people only have a specific time period to watch tv , and they are spending some of that time online instead .

the competition commission said there was evidence that the store card market was uncompetitive , with interest rates far higher than they should be .
the watchdog said it wanted warnings on card statements to inform consumers of interest rates and late payment fees .
there are about 14 million store card accounts in the uk .
competitive pressures following an investigation , the competition commission said it had provisionally concluded that the market for offering consumer credit through retail store cards was uncompetitive .
people it seems are genuinely ignorant about the rates they are signing up to when they take out a store card competition commission spokesman q & a : store card shake-up the body said retailers and lenders were protected from competitive pressures and there was little incentive to reduce annual percentage rates -lrb- aprs -rrb- on store cards , which currently averaged about 30 % .
this compares unfavourably to credit cards which commonly charge between 15 % and 20 % and the bank of england base rate , which is currently 4.5 % .
these " adverse " effects on competition were unlikely to be resolved over the next two years , forcing the commission to take action .
" consumers ' sensitivity to apr levels and other charges is low , " said christopher clarke , the commission 's deputy chairman .
" this results in store cardholders who take up credit , and associated insurance , paying more than they would in a fully competitive market . "
health warnings the commission 's investigation focused on the general functioning of the market and not the behaviour of individual companies .
it is now consulting on a number of potential remedies , including forcing providers to put health warnings about rates on store card statements and improving information on payment methods .
the commission 's proposals for statements to include more consumer information will bring the store card market in line with the wider credit industry .
we are now seeing lower store card aprs , the move to store-branded credit cards and greater consumer transparency ashley holmes , finance and leasing association the credit card industry , following a parliamentary treasury select committee enquiry into uk debt , agreed to introduce similar warnings on statements last year .
a competition commission spokesman told bbc news that greater consumer information was the way to tackle the high aprs being charged by store card providers .
" people , it seems , are genuinely ignorant about the rates they are signing up to when they take out a store card ... if we raise the level of consumer knowledge then competition will improve and aprs , which are too high , should fall , " the spokesman said .
the finance and leasing association -lrb- fla -rrb- , whose members include all the major store card providers , said that in recent times aprs on offer from store card providers had become more competitive .
