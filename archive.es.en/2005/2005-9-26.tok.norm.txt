hamburg still trail the bavarians by one point . second-place hamburg 's 2-0 home win over bayern in front of 55,800 fans and bayer leverkusen 's 2-1 loss away to weder bremen , currently in third place , narrow the gap in the german top flight 's first three spots to just two points . the dutchman rafael van der vaart 's fourth goal of the season gave hamburg the lead in the 10th minute and piotr trochowski , who bayern sent to hamburg in november 2003 , ensured hsv 's first victory over munich since february 1996 with another goal in the 62nd minute .

" we deserved to lose , hsv was the better team , " magath admitted after the game .
" in the first half we could n't find our rhythm .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .
of the five major parties , only the free-market liberal free democratic party ran on platform that called for belt-tightening in the german budget . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may flout eu budget rules again the german budget deficit amounted to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the first half of the year , raising the specter of the country , a repeat offender , flouting eu stability pact rules yet again .

" that is quite nice because in the past they have only said that about -lrb- werder -rrb- bremen and -lrb- bayer -rrb- leverkusen . "
hamburg have not won a major trophy since lifting the domestic cup in 1987 but bayern president franz beckenbauer believes the six-time german champions pose a real threat .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " declared beckenbauer . dw-world.de bayern dominance creates boringliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .

11 terrorist attacks . spain 's high court on monday jailed 18 al qaeda operatives , including the syrian head of a spanish-based cell found to have helped to organize the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , as europe 's largest trial involving osama bin laden 's network concluded . in a verdict that stretched to 445 pages , the three spanish judges sentenced imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , to 27 years jail for conspiring to commit murder in the september 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people .
he was regarded as having led a spanish-based al qaeda cell under investigation since 1995 . convicts arranged atta meeting the prosecution had accused dahdah and a moroccan , driss chebli , of arranging a july 2001 meeting in tarragona , northeastern spain , attended by mohammed atta , ringleader of the sept .
11 hijackers . prosecutor pedro rubira said the meeting " probably determined the date of the attacks on the united states . " chebli was given six years in jail after being found guilty of collaborating with al qaeda . but syrian abrash ghalyoun , who along with dahdah and chebli had stood accused of aiding and abetting the carnage of sept .
11 , was freed along with five others found not guilty on lesser charges alleging al qaeda collaboration . ghalyoun had been questioned about why he had videotaped the twin towers of the world trade center in new york - destroyed in the attacks - in 1997 . bildunterschrift : the suspects behind bullet-proof glass in the spanish courtroom he said he was simply taking pictures as a tourist .
the sentences of those found guilty of helping the group were a far cry from those which prosecutors had demanded after an outcome which suggested that a trial slated for next year of 28 mainly moroccan suspects believed behind last year 's madrid train bombings will be at least as complex . al-jazeera will appeal jailing of journalist prosecutors had wanted dahdah , chebli and ghalyoun to be handed " exemplary " sentences of a record 74,377 years - 25 years for each of the 2,973 sept .
11 victims and 12 more for membership of a ' terrorist ' organization .
under spanish law they could only have served 30 .

indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .

but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .
having learned a lesson from the last expansion , the directorate general for translation has already begun the search for suitable translators . klaus dahmann -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs .

the result of the parliamentary elections was , nonetheless , a dramatic call for change and a ticket for reform in the new eu member , which marked the rejection of the legacy of communism once and for all . the vote count gave the catholic law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- 26.56 percent of the vote and , most likely , 151 seats in the 460-seat parliament .
the free-market civic platform was second with 24.08 percent of the vote , and 123 expected seats . the two parties have confirmed their intention to form a coalition , which the vote assures a comfortable majority . restori n g trust i n the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party jaroslaw kaczynski wants to restore trust in the state " everything indicates that we have won , but this is only the beginning , " said pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become poland 's next prime minister . " we must rebuild many things in poland .
we must restore trust in the state , something which has been highly compromised in recent years , " said kaczynski , whose identical twin lech is running for president in next month 's election . finishing third with 67 expected seats was the samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party , a grouping that frequently changes its political leanings , ahead of the ruling democratic left alliance -lrb- sld -rrb- , which has been seriously tainted by corruption and was likely to win only 51 seats . the 11 percent score , although described by leaders of the party as good , was a far cry from the 41 percent of seats the sld won in 2001 . bildunterschrift : vote for cha n ge pre-election surveys had predicted the sld would reap at most 8 percent , and at worst not even the five percent required to get into parliament , even though it brought poland into the eu and has driven the economy on an upward path , while slowly beginning to bring unemployment down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government was voted out after bringing poland into the eu the ultra catholic and nationalist league of polish families with a possible 36 seats and the peasants party with 30 seats were the only other parties with the more than 5 percent of the vote needed to enter parliament . " generally speaking , poles voted for change , " said slawomir debski , an analyst at poland 's institute of international relations .
" we can not cite the german syndrome , where fear of liberalism was a determining factor .
the ruling parties , the sld and their one-time ally , the psl , were swept aside , while pis and po , two groups which made their debut in parliament during the last mandate , won . " the twi n s o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan rokita , leader of poland 's pro-business civic platform , which came second in the parliamentary elections with pis finishing in the lead , the conservative party should choose who will become poland 's next prime minister , with jaroslaw kaczynski their likely choice .
po 's premier-designate jan rokita -lrb- photo -rrb- said after casting his vote in the southern city of krakow that the new head of government should be named as soon as the final results are known . but that proposal did not sit well with presidential candidate lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin , who fears his chances of beating po 's donald tusk could well be torpedoed if someone who looks just like him is appointed prime minister . tusk , whom polls show to have a commanding lead in next month 's presidential election , conceded defeat to pis in the parliamentary vote , and vowed to work with together for the good of poland . " now the time has come for us to see what we can do together for poland , " tusk said .

" eco n omic voes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is largest of the ten new eu member states po has proposed an across-the-board 15-percent tax rate , which pis described last month as a good way to scare off voters . pis , meanwhile , campaigned on a socialist manifesto at odds with its traditional conservatism - calling for state aid and tax breaks for the underprivileged , and government intervention in the economy . their different takes on how to tackle poland 's economic woes , notably unemployment , which at 17.8 percent is the highest in the eu , and their pre-election bickering have raised fears that their coalition may be unworkable . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland set to swing to the right in polls poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 berlin 's new garden of paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden pavilion in the garden 's center represents the source of life the newest addition to berlin 's " gardens of the world , " a traditional islamic garden , is drawing the curious in record numbers .
some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .

he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 26.09.2005 eu ready to punish germany over deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's not saving enough , the eu says germany 's continued violation of the eu stability and growth pact has once again raised hackles in brussels .
the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 berlin 's new garden of paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden pavilion in the garden 's center represents the source of life the newest addition to berlin 's " gardens of the world , " a traditional islamic garden , is drawing the curious in record numbers .
some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .
of the five major parties , only the free-market liberal free democratic party ran on platform that called for belt-tightening in the german budget . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may flout eu budget rules again the german budget deficit amounted to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the first half of the year , raising the specter of the country , a repeat offender , flouting eu stability pact rules yet again .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2005 cracking up auf deutsch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , germans seem to long for a sense of humor it is a truth - not yet universally acknowledged - that a single german man , regardless of his good fortune , must be in want of a funny girlfriend .
who would 've thought ? on sept .
30 , new york university 's deutsches haus is starting a new film series called " a german sense of humor ? ! "
appropriately enough , the organizers used both a question mark a n d the exclamation point to express their shock and disbelief that there could ever be such a thing as a german sense of humor . it 's easy to understand the skepticism of the nyu film junkies .
germans are , after all , not exactly known as a nation of jokesters .
sure , they wear lederhosen , eat sausages and speak german , the yapping sounds of which are funny enough to begin with , but have you ever met anybody who 's in love with the german sense of humor ? germans seem to think differently .
according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .
72 percent of german men believe that a woman 's sense of humor is as important as her looks . what so fu n n y about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a land of fun !

11 terrorist attacks . spain 's high court on monday jailed 18 al qaeda operatives , including the syrian head of a spanish-based cell found to have helped to organize the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , as europe 's largest trial involving osama bin laden 's network concluded . in a verdict that stretched to 445 pages , the three spanish judges sentenced imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , to 27 years jail for conspiring to commit murder in the september 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people .
he was regarded as having led a spanish-based al qaeda cell under investigation since 1995 . convicts arranged atta meeting the prosecution had accused dahdah and a moroccan , driss chebli , of arranging a july 2001 meeting in tarragona , northeastern spain , attended by mohammed atta , ringleader of the sept .
11 hijackers . prosecutor pedro rubira said the meeting " probably determined the date of the attacks on the united states . " chebli was given six years in jail after being found guilty of collaborating with al qaeda . but syrian abrash ghalyoun , who along with dahdah and chebli had stood accused of aiding and abetting the carnage of sept .
11 , was freed along with five others found not guilty on lesser charges alleging al qaeda collaboration . ghalyoun had been questioned about why he had videotaped the twin towers of the world trade center in new york - destroyed in the attacks - in 1997 . bildunterschrift : the suspects behind bullet-proof glass in the spanish courtroom he said he was simply taking pictures as a tourist .
the sentences of those found guilty of helping the group were a far cry from those which prosecutors had demanded after an outcome which suggested that a trial slated for next year of 28 mainly moroccan suspects believed behind last year 's madrid train bombings will be at least as complex . al-jazeera will appeal jailing of journalist prosecutors had wanted dahdah , chebli and ghalyoun to be handed " exemplary " sentences of a record 74,377 years - 25 years for each of the 2,973 sept .

and he would do the same again , " his wife fatima zahra told reporters after the sentencing . al jazeera said it would appeal against the " unfair " conviction following a " verdict -lrb- which -rrb- is very disappointing , " director general waddah khanfar told afp in doha . " we still believe our colleague tayssir is innocent of the charges against him , " he added . alouny , who had insisted on his innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alouny , in an interview throughout the trial , was accused of acting as a financial courier to the group while in afghanistan , alouny said he was only doing his job as a journalist . the court said alouny was not a member of the dahdah-led spanish cell , but " collaborated ... in determined fashion " with al qaeda and used his position to pass information to and from members of the organization . suspect brands trial a farce the other 15 suspects to be jailed were given terms ranging from six to 11 years on charges relating to collaboration with the network , and a further six were acquitted . in july testimony abu dahdah had branded the trial a farce . of bin laden , he said , " i know absolutely nothing of this man .
i condemn what happened -lrb- on sept .
11 -rrb- . " he said accusations that he led a " soldiers of allah " extremist group were " a myth - totally false , " and that islam " clearly says that killing children , women , elderly people is wrong , as is bringing down buildings . " german-based suspect still at large the trial heard testimony from 107 witnesses .
they included jamel zougam , a moroccan and alleged acquaintance of abu dahdah who is a prime suspect in the madrid train bombings . spanish prosecutors had wanted to hear the testimony of mahmoun darkanzali , a syrian married to a german , who was released by german police after they failed to find enough evidence to connect him with the sept .

indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .

the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .

the result of the parliamentary elections was , nonetheless , a dramatic call for change and a ticket for reform in the new eu member , which marked the rejection of the legacy of communism once and for all . the vote count gave the catholic law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- 26.56 percent of the vote and , most likely , 151 seats in the 460-seat parliament .
the free-market civic platform was second with 24.08 percent of the vote , and 123 expected seats . the two parties have confirmed their intention to form a coalition , which the vote assures a comfortable majority . restori n g trust i n the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party jaroslaw kaczynski wants to restore trust in the state " everything indicates that we have won , but this is only the beginning , " said pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become poland 's next prime minister . " we must rebuild many things in poland .
we must restore trust in the state , something which has been highly compromised in recent years , " said kaczynski , whose identical twin lech is running for president in next month 's election . finishing third with 67 expected seats was the samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party , a grouping that frequently changes its political leanings , ahead of the ruling democratic left alliance -lrb- sld -rrb- , which has been seriously tainted by corruption and was likely to win only 51 seats . the 11 percent score , although described by leaders of the party as good , was a far cry from the 41 percent of seats the sld won in 2001 . bildunterschrift : vote for cha n ge pre-election surveys had predicted the sld would reap at most 8 percent , and at worst not even the five percent required to get into parliament , even though it brought poland into the eu and has driven the economy on an upward path , while slowly beginning to bring unemployment down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government was voted out after bringing poland into the eu the ultra catholic and nationalist league of polish families with a possible 36 seats and the peasants party with 30 seats were the only other parties with the more than 5 percent of the vote needed to enter parliament . " generally speaking , poles voted for change , " said slawomir debski , an analyst at poland 's institute of international relations .
" we can not cite the german syndrome , where fear of liberalism was a determining factor .
the ruling parties , the sld and their one-time ally , the psl , were swept aside , while pis and po , two groups which made their debut in parliament during the last mandate , won . " the twi n s o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan rokita , leader of poland 's pro-business civic platform , which came second in the parliamentary elections with pis finishing in the lead , the conservative party should choose who will become poland 's next prime minister , with jaroslaw kaczynski their likely choice .
po 's premier-designate jan rokita -lrb- photo -rrb- said after casting his vote in the southern city of krakow that the new head of government should be named as soon as the final results are known . but that proposal did not sit well with presidential candidate lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin , who fears his chances of beating po 's donald tusk could well be torpedoed if someone who looks just like him is appointed prime minister . tusk , whom polls show to have a commanding lead in next month 's presidential election , conceded defeat to pis in the parliamentary vote , and vowed to work with together for the good of poland . " now the time has come for us to see what we can do together for poland , " tusk said .

indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .
having learned a lesson from the last expansion , the directorate general for translation has already begun the search for suitable translators . klaus dahmann -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2005 cracking up auf deutsch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , germans seem to long for a sense of humor it is a truth - not yet universally acknowledged - that a single german man , regardless of his good fortune , must be in want of a funny girlfriend .
who would 've thought ? on sept .
30 , new york university 's deutsches haus is starting a new film series called " a german sense of humor ? ! "
appropriately enough , the organizers used both a question mark a n d the exclamation point to express their shock and disbelief that there could ever be such a thing as a german sense of humor . it 's easy to understand the skepticism of the nyu film junkies .
germans are , after all , not exactly known as a nation of jokesters .
sure , they wear lederhosen , eat sausages and speak german , the yapping sounds of which are funny enough to begin with , but have you ever met anybody who 's in love with the german sense of humor ? germans seem to think differently .
according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .
72 percent of german men believe that a woman 's sense of humor is as important as her looks . what so fu n n y about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a land of fun !
before we rush to judgment and proclaim that the germans are the new irish - cracking hilarious jokes in the face of adversity while celebrating life with passion and spontaneity - we should put things into perspective . another recent survey showed that only 15 percent of germans said that the best sex to be had was " made in germany . "
the overwhelming majority of germans looked wistfully towards italy for erotic inspiration -lrb- and probably thanked the eu for open borders -rrb- . the same study showed that germans were considerably less needy in the sack than other europeans .
while 25 percent of greeks boasted they needed sex at least five times a week , 65 percent of germans were satisfied with getting wild twice a week - or less . to joke or n ot to joke ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this german guy wants is a funny girl to giggle with so , if german men say that a sense of humor is more important than sex , what does that really mean ?
that they finds enough time in their busy schedules to laugh three times a week ?
or that a few german jokes a week are enough to satisfy their appetites , since they daydream anyway about luscious cicciolinas in the land of pizza , mozzarella , pasta and stracciatella ?
or that they expect so little from sex that they want to be able , at least , to laugh about it ? one thing we 've all learned from the recent german elections , however , is that we should n't trust polls .
it is unlikely that the germans will trade their traditional philosophical brooding for jolly carelessness any time soon , but we ca n't really be too sure . after all , at least one political organization - the german anarchist party - is already working hard on spicing up german sex life . or as dw-world reader emma storr from london put it : " some anarchy is needed to liberate germans from the shackle of benefits and improve their sex life . " with a little luck and a lot more discipline , the anarchists may transform germany into a blossoming landscape of erotic hilarity . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...
italians do it .
greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often .

money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .
a new survey reveals germans would prefer less erotic satisfaction in 2005 and more of the pecuniary sort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.09.2005 poland veers to the right after election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , unlike germany , voted decisively for a new government vote-counting following the polish parliamentary election on sunday confirmed the victory of the two conservative parties fighting in the first national vote since the country joined the eu last year . with 60 percent of the votes counted , the victory for the polish center-right was slightly less impressive than suggested by exit polls on sunday .
the result of the parliamentary elections was , nonetheless , a dramatic call for change and a ticket for reform in the new eu member , which marked the rejection of the legacy of communism once and for all . the vote count gave the catholic law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- 26.56 percent of the vote and , most likely , 151 seats in the 460-seat parliament .
the free-market civic platform was second with 24.08 percent of the vote , and 123 expected seats . the two parties have confirmed their intention to form a coalition , which the vote assures a comfortable majority . restori n g trust i n the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party jaroslaw kaczynski wants to restore trust in the state " everything indicates that we have won , but this is only the beginning , " said pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become poland 's next prime minister . " we must rebuild many things in poland .
we must restore trust in the state , something which has been highly compromised in recent years , " said kaczynski , whose identical twin lech is running for president in next month 's election . finishing third with 67 expected seats was the samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party , a grouping that frequently changes its political leanings , ahead of the ruling democratic left alliance -lrb- sld -rrb- , which has been seriously tainted by corruption and was likely to win only 51 seats . the 11 percent score , although described by leaders of the party as good , was a far cry from the 41 percent of seats the sld won in 2001 . bildunterschrift : vote for cha n ge pre-election surveys had predicted the sld would reap at most 8 percent , and at worst not even the five percent required to get into parliament , even though it brought poland into the eu and has driven the economy on an upward path , while slowly beginning to bring unemployment down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government was voted out after bringing poland into the eu the ultra catholic and nationalist league of polish families with a possible 36 seats and the peasants party with 30 seats were the only other parties with the more than 5 percent of the vote needed to enter parliament . " generally speaking , poles voted for change , " said slawomir debski , an analyst at poland 's institute of international relations .
" we can not cite the german syndrome , where fear of liberalism was a determining factor .
the ruling parties , the sld and their one-time ally , the psl , were swept aside , while pis and po , two groups which made their debut in parliament during the last mandate , won . " the twi n s o n the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan rokita , leader of poland 's pro-business civic platform , which came second in the parliamentary elections with pis finishing in the lead , the conservative party should choose who will become poland 's next prime minister , with jaroslaw kaczynski their likely choice .
po 's premier-designate jan rokita -lrb- photo -rrb- said after casting his vote in the southern city of krakow that the new head of government should be named as soon as the final results are known . but that proposal did not sit well with presidential candidate lech kaczynski , jaroslaw 's twin , who fears his chances of beating po 's donald tusk could well be torpedoed if someone who looks just like him is appointed prime minister . tusk , whom polls show to have a commanding lead in next month 's presidential election , conceded defeat to pis in the parliamentary vote , and vowed to work with together for the good of poland . " now the time has come for us to see what we can do together for poland , " tusk said .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

marianne birthler , who heads the state-funded body that manages the archives of the infamous stasi , told a german newspaper on friday that " at least seven " of the 54 lawmakers from the left party were listed in documents as " unofficial collaborators " for the former communist regime .
only later on friday did birthler clarify that she had been referring to seven of the party 's candidates for election and admitted she did not know if they were among the candidates who eventually won seats in parliament .
birthler said in monday 's die welt newspaper that while she regretted her original choice of words , she rejected the left party 's accusations that her allegations had been politically motivated .
" among the candidates for the left party there were known cases that i had in mind when i said what i said , " birthler told die welt .
" not all of them were elected .
unfortunately i only corrected myself a few days afterwards .
i should not have given any figure . "
left party official bodo ramelow said birthler had failed to show the " necessary objectivity " to carry on in her job and should resign .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 dealing with europe 's multilingual reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the babble has created horrific translation problems for the eu as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them . when european politicians speak about europe 's rich cultural legacy , they never fail to mention the myriad babble of tongues spoken across the continent .
indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .
having learned a lesson from the last expansion , the directorate general for translation has already begun the search for suitable translators . klaus dahmann -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs .
-lrb- may 2 , 2004 -rrb- europe battles english invasion fast becoming europe 's lingua franca , english has invaded other national languages .
the trend has some on the continent worried that languages might in the future take second place even within their countries of origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 dealing with europe 's multilingual reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the babble has created horrific translation problems for the eu as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them . when european politicians speak about europe 's rich cultural legacy , they never fail to mention the myriad babble of tongues spoken across the continent .
indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .
having learned a lesson from the last expansion , the directorate general for translation has already begun the search for suitable translators . klaus dahmann -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?
the eu is the only international body in which all participants can speak their own language .
as of may 1 , each new language requires around 60 translators , but the small island of malta is struggling to fill these jobs .
-lrb- may 2 , 2004 -rrb- europe battles english invasion fast becoming europe 's lingua franca , english has invaded other national languages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2005 cracking up auf deutsch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , germans seem to long for a sense of humor it is a truth - not yet universally acknowledged - that a single german man , regardless of his good fortune , must be in want of a funny girlfriend .
who would 've thought ? on sept .
30 , new york university 's deutsches haus is starting a new film series called " a german sense of humor ? ! "
appropriately enough , the organizers used both a question mark a n d the exclamation point to express their shock and disbelief that there could ever be such a thing as a german sense of humor . it 's easy to understand the skepticism of the nyu film junkies .
germans are , after all , not exactly known as a nation of jokesters .
sure , they wear lederhosen , eat sausages and speak german , the yapping sounds of which are funny enough to begin with , but have you ever met anybody who 's in love with the german sense of humor ? germans seem to think differently .
according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .
72 percent of german men believe that a woman 's sense of humor is as important as her looks . what so fu n n y about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a land of fun !
before we rush to judgment and proclaim that the germans are the new irish - cracking hilarious jokes in the face of adversity while celebrating life with passion and spontaneity - we should put things into perspective . another recent survey showed that only 15 percent of germans said that the best sex to be had was " made in germany . "
the overwhelming majority of germans looked wistfully towards italy for erotic inspiration -lrb- and probably thanked the eu for open borders -rrb- . the same study showed that germans were considerably less needy in the sack than other europeans .
while 25 percent of greeks boasted they needed sex at least five times a week , 65 percent of germans were satisfied with getting wild twice a week - or less . to joke or n ot to joke ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this german guy wants is a funny girl to giggle with so , if german men say that a sense of humor is more important than sex , what does that really mean ?
that they finds enough time in their busy schedules to laugh three times a week ?
or that a few german jokes a week are enough to satisfy their appetites , since they daydream anyway about luscious cicciolinas in the land of pizza , mozzarella , pasta and stracciatella ?
or that they expect so little from sex that they want to be able , at least , to laugh about it ? one thing we 've all learned from the recent german elections , however , is that we should n't trust polls .
it is unlikely that the germans will trade their traditional philosophical brooding for jolly carelessness any time soon , but we ca n't really be too sure . after all , at least one political organization - the german anarchist party - is already working hard on spicing up german sex life . or as dw-world reader emma storr from london put it : " some anarchy is needed to liberate germans from the shackle of benefits and improve their sex life . " with a little luck and a lot more discipline , the anarchists may transform germany into a blossoming landscape of erotic hilarity . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...
italians do it .
greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .
of the five major parties , only the free-market liberal free democratic party ran on platform that called for belt-tightening in the german budget . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may flout eu budget rules again the german budget deficit amounted to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the first half of the year , raising the specter of the country , a repeat offender , flouting eu stability pact rules yet again .

under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .

marianne birthler , who heads the state-funded body that manages the archives of the infamous stasi , told a german newspaper on friday that " at least seven " of the 54 lawmakers from the left party were listed in documents as " unofficial collaborators " for the former communist regime .
only later on friday did birthler clarify that she had been referring to seven of the party 's candidates for election and admitted she did not know if they were among the candidates who eventually won seats in parliament .
birthler said in monday 's die welt newspaper that while she regretted her original choice of words , she rejected the left party 's accusations that her allegations had been politically motivated .
" among the candidates for the left party there were known cases that i had in mind when i said what i said , " birthler told die welt .
" not all of them were elected .
unfortunately i only corrected myself a few days afterwards .
i should not have given any figure . "
left party official bodo ramelow said birthler had failed to show the " necessary objectivity " to carry on in her job and should resign .
but birthler said she stood by her call for all newly elected lawmakers in the bundestag lower house of parliament to be investigated , regardless of their party affiliation . dw-world.de secret police in germany 's parliament ?

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden .

marianne birthler , who heads the state-funded body that manages the archives of the infamous stasi , told a german newspaper on friday that " at least seven " of the 54 lawmakers from the left party were listed in documents as " unofficial collaborators " for the former communist regime .
only later on friday did birthler clarify that she had been referring to seven of the party 's candidates for election and admitted she did not know if they were among the candidates who eventually won seats in parliament .
birthler said in monday 's die welt newspaper that while she regretted her original choice of words , she rejected the left party 's accusations that her allegations had been politically motivated .
" among the candidates for the left party there were known cases that i had in mind when i said what i said , " birthler told die welt .
" not all of them were elected .
unfortunately i only corrected myself a few days afterwards .
i should not have given any figure . "
left party official bodo ramelow said birthler had failed to show the " necessary objectivity " to carry on in her job and should resign .
but birthler said she stood by her call for all newly elected lawmakers in the bundestag lower house of parliament to be investigated , regardless of their party affiliation . dw-world.de secret police in germany 's parliament ?

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .
of the five major parties , only the free-market liberal free democratic party ran on platform that called for belt-tightening in the german budget . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may flout eu budget rules again the german budget deficit amounted to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the first half of the year , raising the specter of the country , a repeat offender , flouting eu stability pact rules yet again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 berlin 's new garden of paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden pavilion in the garden 's center represents the source of life the newest addition to berlin 's " gardens of the world , " a traditional islamic garden , is drawing the curious in record numbers .
some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2005 cracking up auf deutsch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more , germans seem to long for a sense of humor it is a truth - not yet universally acknowledged - that a single german man , regardless of his good fortune , must be in want of a funny girlfriend .
who would 've thought ? on sept .
30 , new york university 's deutsches haus is starting a new film series called " a german sense of humor ? ! "
appropriately enough , the organizers used both a question mark a n d the exclamation point to express their shock and disbelief that there could ever be such a thing as a german sense of humor . it 's easy to understand the skepticism of the nyu film junkies .
germans are , after all , not exactly known as a nation of jokesters .
sure , they wear lederhosen , eat sausages and speak german , the yapping sounds of which are funny enough to begin with , but have you ever met anybody who 's in love with the german sense of humor ? germans seem to think differently .
according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .
72 percent of german men believe that a woman 's sense of humor is as important as her looks . what so fu n n y about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a land of fun !
before we rush to judgment and proclaim that the germans are the new irish - cracking hilarious jokes in the face of adversity while celebrating life with passion and spontaneity - we should put things into perspective . another recent survey showed that only 15 percent of germans said that the best sex to be had was " made in germany . "
the overwhelming majority of germans looked wistfully towards italy for erotic inspiration -lrb- and probably thanked the eu for open borders -rrb- . the same study showed that germans were considerably less needy in the sack than other europeans .
while 25 percent of greeks boasted they needed sex at least five times a week , 65 percent of germans were satisfied with getting wild twice a week - or less . to joke or n ot to joke ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this german guy wants is a funny girl to giggle with so , if german men say that a sense of humor is more important than sex , what does that really mean ?
that they finds enough time in their busy schedules to laugh three times a week ?
or that a few german jokes a week are enough to satisfy their appetites , since they daydream anyway about luscious cicciolinas in the land of pizza , mozzarella , pasta and stracciatella ?
or that they expect so little from sex that they want to be able , at least , to laugh about it ? one thing we 've all learned from the recent german elections , however , is that we should n't trust polls .
it is unlikely that the germans will trade their traditional philosophical brooding for jolly carelessness any time soon , but we ca n't really be too sure . after all , at least one political organization - the german anarchist party - is already working hard on spicing up german sex life . or as dw-world reader emma storr from london put it : " some anarchy is needed to liberate germans from the shackle of benefits and improve their sex life . " with a little luck and a lot more discipline , the anarchists may transform germany into a blossoming landscape of erotic hilarity . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...
italians do it .
greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often .

money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .
a new survey reveals germans would prefer less erotic satisfaction in 2005 and more of the pecuniary sort .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.09.2005 poland veers to the right after election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland , unlike germany , voted decisively for a new government vote-counting following the polish parliamentary election on sunday confirmed the victory of the two conservative parties fighting in the first national vote since the country joined the eu last year . with 60 percent of the votes counted , the victory for the polish center-right was slightly less impressive than suggested by exit polls on sunday .
the result of the parliamentary elections was , nonetheless , a dramatic call for change and a ticket for reform in the new eu member , which marked the rejection of the legacy of communism once and for all . the vote count gave the catholic law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- 26.56 percent of the vote and , most likely , 151 seats in the 460-seat parliament .
the free-market civic platform was second with 24.08 percent of the vote , and 123 expected seats . the two parties have confirmed their intention to form a coalition , which the vote assures a comfortable majority . restori n g trust i n the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party jaroslaw kaczynski wants to restore trust in the state " everything indicates that we have won , but this is only the beginning , " said pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become poland 's next prime minister . " we must rebuild many things in poland .
we must restore trust in the state , something which has been highly compromised in recent years , " said kaczynski , whose identical twin lech is running for president in next month 's election . finishing third with 67 expected seats was the samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party , a grouping that frequently changes its political leanings , ahead of the ruling democratic left alliance -lrb- sld -rrb- , which has been seriously tainted by corruption and was likely to win only 51 seats . the 11 percent score , although described by leaders of the party as good , was a far cry from the 41 percent of seats the sld won in 2001 . bildunterschrift : vote for cha n ge pre-election surveys had predicted the sld would reap at most 8 percent , and at worst not even the five percent required to get into parliament , even though it brought poland into the eu and has driven the economy on an upward path , while slowly beginning to bring unemployment down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government was voted out after bringing poland into the eu the ultra catholic and nationalist league of polish families with a possible 36 seats and the peasants party with 30 seats were the only other parties with the more than 5 percent of the vote needed to enter parliament .

the result of the parliamentary elections was , nonetheless , a dramatic call for change and a ticket for reform in the new eu member , which marked the rejection of the legacy of communism once and for all . the vote count gave the catholic law and justice party -lrb- pis -rrb- 26.56 percent of the vote and , most likely , 151 seats in the 460-seat parliament .
the free-market civic platform was second with 24.08 percent of the vote , and 123 expected seats . the two parties have confirmed their intention to form a coalition , which the vote assures a comfortable majority . restori n g trust i n the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leader of poland 's conservative law and justice party jaroslaw kaczynski wants to restore trust in the state " everything indicates that we have won , but this is only the beginning , " said pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become poland 's next prime minister . " we must rebuild many things in poland .
we must restore trust in the state , something which has been highly compromised in recent years , " said kaczynski , whose identical twin lech is running for president in next month 's election . finishing third with 67 expected seats was the samoobrona -lrb- self-defense -rrb- party , a grouping that frequently changes its political leanings , ahead of the ruling democratic left alliance -lrb- sld -rrb- , which has been seriously tainted by corruption and was likely to win only 51 seats . the 11 percent score , although described by leaders of the party as good , was a far cry from the 41 percent of seats the sld won in 2001 . bildunterschrift : vote for cha n ge pre-election surveys had predicted the sld would reap at most 8 percent , and at worst not even the five percent required to get into parliament , even though it brought poland into the eu and has driven the economy on an upward path , while slowly beginning to bring unemployment down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government was voted out after bringing poland into the eu the ultra catholic and nationalist league of polish families with a possible 36 seats and the peasants party with 30 seats were the only other parties with the more than 5 percent of the vote needed to enter parliament .

11 terrorist attacks . spain 's high court on monday jailed 18 al qaeda operatives , including the syrian head of a spanish-based cell found to have helped to organize the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , as europe 's largest trial involving osama bin laden 's network concluded . in a verdict that stretched to 445 pages , the three spanish judges sentenced imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , to 27 years jail for conspiring to commit murder in the september 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people .
he was regarded as having led a spanish-based al qaeda cell under investigation since 1995 . convicts arranged atta meeting the prosecution had accused dahdah and a moroccan , driss chebli , of arranging a july 2001 meeting in tarragona , northeastern spain , attended by mohammed atta , ringleader of the sept .
11 hijackers . prosecutor pedro rubira said the meeting " probably determined the date of the attacks on the united states . " chebli was given six years in jail after being found guilty of collaborating with al qaeda . but syrian abrash ghalyoun , who along with dahdah and chebli had stood accused of aiding and abetting the carnage of sept .
11 , was freed along with five others found not guilty on lesser charges alleging al qaeda collaboration . ghalyoun had been questioned about why he had videotaped the twin towers of the world trade center in new york - destroyed in the attacks - in 1997 . bildunterschrift : the suspects behind bullet-proof glass in the spanish courtroom he said he was simply taking pictures as a tourist .
the sentences of those found guilty of helping the group were a far cry from those which prosecutors had demanded after an outcome which suggested that a trial slated for next year of 28 mainly moroccan suspects believed behind last year 's madrid train bombings will be at least as complex . al-jazeera will appeal jailing of journalist prosecutors had wanted dahdah , chebli and ghalyoun to be handed " exemplary " sentences of a record 74,377 years - 25 years for each of the 2,973 sept .
11 victims and 12 more for membership of a ' terrorist ' organization .

and he would do the same again , " his wife fatima zahra told reporters after the sentencing . al jazeera said it would appeal against the " unfair " conviction following a " verdict -lrb- which -rrb- is very disappointing , " director general waddah khanfar told afp in doha . " we still believe our colleague tayssir is innocent of the charges against him , " he added . alouny , who had insisted on his innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alouny , in an interview throughout the trial , was accused of acting as a financial courier to the group while in afghanistan , alouny said he was only doing his job as a journalist . the court said alouny was not a member of the dahdah-led spanish cell , but " collaborated ... in determined fashion " with al qaeda and used his position to pass information to and from members of the organization . suspect brands trial a farce the other 15 suspects to be jailed were given terms ranging from six to 11 years on charges relating to collaboration with the network , and a further six were acquitted . in july testimony abu dahdah had branded the trial a farce . of bin laden , he said , " i know absolutely nothing of this man .
i condemn what happened -lrb- on sept .
11 -rrb- . " he said accusations that he led a " soldiers of allah " extremist group were " a myth - totally false , " and that islam " clearly says that killing children , women , elderly people is wrong , as is bringing down buildings . " german-based suspect still at large the trial heard testimony from 107 witnesses .
they included jamel zougam , a moroccan and alleged acquaintance of abu dahdah who is a prime suspect in the madrid train bombings . spanish prosecutors had wanted to hear the testimony of mahmoun darkanzali , a syrian married to a german , who was released by german police after they failed to find enough evidence to connect him with the sept .
11 plotters .

11 terrorist attacks . spain 's high court on monday jailed 18 al qaeda operatives , including the syrian head of a spanish-based cell found to have helped to organize the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , as europe 's largest trial involving osama bin laden 's network concluded . in a verdict that stretched to 445 pages , the three spanish judges sentenced imad eddin barakat yarkas , alias abu dahdah , to 27 years jail for conspiring to commit murder in the september 11 attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people .
he was regarded as having led a spanish-based al qaeda cell under investigation since 1995 . convicts arranged atta meeting the prosecution had accused dahdah and a moroccan , driss chebli , of arranging a july 2001 meeting in tarragona , northeastern spain , attended by mohammed atta , ringleader of the sept .
11 hijackers . prosecutor pedro rubira said the meeting " probably determined the date of the attacks on the united states . " chebli was given six years in jail after being found guilty of collaborating with al qaeda . but syrian abrash ghalyoun , who along with dahdah and chebli had stood accused of aiding and abetting the carnage of sept .
11 , was freed along with five others found not guilty on lesser charges alleging al qaeda collaboration . ghalyoun had been questioned about why he had videotaped the twin towers of the world trade center in new york - destroyed in the attacks - in 1997 . bildunterschrift : the suspects behind bullet-proof glass in the spanish courtroom he said he was simply taking pictures as a tourist .
the sentences of those found guilty of helping the group were a far cry from those which prosecutors had demanded after an outcome which suggested that a trial slated for next year of 28 mainly moroccan suspects believed behind last year 's madrid train bombings will be at least as complex . al-jazeera will appeal jailing of journalist prosecutors had wanted dahdah , chebli and ghalyoun to be handed " exemplary " sentences of a record 74,377 years - 25 years for each of the 2,973 sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 berlin 's new garden of paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden pavilion in the garden 's center represents the source of life the newest addition to berlin 's " gardens of the world , " a traditional islamic garden , is drawing the curious in record numbers .
some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 dealing with europe 's multilingual reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the babble has created horrific translation problems for the eu as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them . when european politicians speak about europe 's rich cultural legacy , they never fail to mention the myriad babble of tongues spoken across the continent .
indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .
having learned a lesson from the last expansion , the directorate general for translation has already begun the search for suitable translators . klaus dahmann -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how do you say accession in maltese ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.09.2005 dealing with europe 's multilingual reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the babble has created horrific translation problems for the eu as the european day of languages is celebrated monday , a look around the eu shows that enlargement has increased the number of official languages in the bloc , but its citizens are n't motivated to learn them . when european politicians speak about europe 's rich cultural legacy , they never fail to mention the myriad babble of tongues spoken across the continent .
indeed , this linguistic diversity is on show at the european union 's many institutions , in particular the european parliament .
but as brussels gets ready to celebrate the bloc 's multi-tongued tradition on the european day of languages on monday , it does n't seem to have managed to spread the enthusiasm for newer foreign languages among its citizens .
a recent survey by bloc 's eurobarometer opinion pollsters showed that eu expansion into ex-communist eastern europe has largely boosted the role of the global lingua franca , english . trying to make learning foreign tongues popular it 's not that eu politicians have n't tried .
four years ago , celebrations on european language day featured an eu commercial showing a chameleon jumping from branch to branch , squeaking the word " hello " in several languages .
it was hoped the multilingual cartoon character would inspire eu citizens to learn foreign languages .
bildunterschrift : the european year of languages 2001 a further initiative , called the language action plan , aims for each citizen to learn two foreign languages .
meant to be implemented between 2004 and 2006 , it includes a loan program called lingua to support the eu member states in offering instruction in at least one foreign language in elementary schools .
but despite being surrounded by different languages , europeans have so far shown little desire to broaden their linguistic horizons . according to statistics , english is easily the most common foreign language , ahead by a huge margin .
english is spoken by 47 percent of eu citizens , including 34 percent who speak it as a foreign language - two percentage points more than before enlargement .
german , which has now surpassed french , is spoken by 30 percent , with 12 percent percent using it as a foreign language .
translations headaches at the same time , brussels is becoming increasingly multilingual .
enlargement added nine new languages - each of the 10 new member states , with the exception of cyprus , brought its own language . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with its official languages now increased to from 11 to 20 , brussels is reeling under the burden of having to provide for translations to and fro between its old and new official tongues .
with 380 translation combinations possible between the 20 languages , the eu has now made translations and interpretations at conferences and summits mandatory via third languages .
for example , official texts and declarations are first translated into english or french and then , in a second step , into further languages .
this saves the need for translators in less common combinations such as greek-latvian or portuguese-finnish , which also helps since there are n't translators for all languages , such as maltese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a language laboratory at the european commission " we had a test for translators from malta in 2003 .
there were 16 candidates .
four made it to the final round , but all of them failed , " said chief translator in brussels , jan andersen .
now the eu is educating maltese translator-trainers in order to plug the loophole . there 's also a dearth of translators for slovenian and the baltic languages .
one ramification of that was seen at the beginning of this year when several members of the estonian parliament complained that the eu laws they were supposed to ratify were sloppily-translated and sent the texts back . the medley of languages and the accompany hurdles have meant that documents needing translation are piling up in brussels .
in order to get a grip on the paper-flood , the eu commission decided to limit official documents to 15 pages just before the latest admission of new member states .
nonetheless , the stack of an estimated 60,000 pages in storage is just going to get bigger .
more to come respite is n't in sight .
in june this year , the eu decided to raise the status of irish-gaelic to the 21st official language in january 2007 . as opposed to that , catalan and basque have n't been given this status - at least not yet - despite pleas by the spanish government and regional politicians from catalonia and the basque country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and by 2007 or 2008 at the latest two more languages will also join the official ranks when bulgaria and romania join the eu .
croatian could follow later .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .
finance minister eichel 's proposal that germany be given special treatment because of the high costs of reunification was grudgingly accepted by brussels . economic analysts do n't expect much change should a grand coalition of christian democrats and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party come into power .
of the five major parties , only the free-market liberal free democratic party ran on platform that called for belt-tightening in the german budget . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany may flout eu budget rules again the german budget deficit amounted to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the first half of the year , raising the specter of the country , a repeat offender , flouting eu stability pact rules yet again .

the union 's monetary commissioner now said he is serious about punishing europe 's largest economy . shortly after it began the process two years ago that could have punished germany for violating the budget rules of the european union 's stability and growth pact , the eu stopped it again . though germany has let its budget break the 3 percent deficit limit the pact places on each of the signees each of the last three years , the eu got a little skittish at the thought of punishing europe 's largest economy .
and to assuage their fears , finance minister hans eichel promised in 2004 to get the 2005 deficit under 3 percent . now , joaquin almunia , the eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , has raised the specter of punishment once again after his office deemed german measures to reduce their deficit insufficient .
the federal statistics office said in august that germany 's budget deficit in the first half of the year was 36 billion euros -lrb- $ 43.3 billion -rrb- , or 3.6 percent of gdp , putting the country on track to violate the pact for a fourth year in a row . tech n ical disagreeme n t could re n ew row bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia eurostat , the european union 's statistics office , believes germany 's deficit will be closer to 4 percent because it does n't look at the sale of outstanding accounts to the former state-run enterprises deutsche telekom and deutsche post as deficit-reducing measures .
the technical disagreement between germany and the eu could lead to serious measures , according to almunia -lrb- photo -rrb- . his spokesperson said he will look into punitive measures after presenting his fall economic forecast .
under the terms of the pact that binds the 12 euro-zone countries , germany could be fined up to 3 billion euros for breaching the three-percent deficit limit . germany has tried unsuccessfully to wrestle its deficit down below 3 percent amid high public spending and a low economic growth .
last march , germany led a successful charge supported by france to water down the rules of the pact , which the country helped create 1997 .

who would 've thought ? on sept .
30 , new york university 's deutsches haus is starting a new film series called " a german sense of humor ? ! "
appropriately enough , the organizers used both a question mark a n d the exclamation point to express their shock and disbelief that there could ever be such a thing as a german sense of humor . it 's easy to understand the skepticism of the nyu film junkies .
germans are , after all , not exactly known as a nation of jokesters .
sure , they wear lederhosen , eat sausages and speak german , the yapping sounds of which are funny enough to begin with , but have you ever met anybody who 's in love with the german sense of humor ? germans seem to think differently .
according to a shocking survey by the german magazine brigitte , 55 percent of german men between the age of 14 and 60 said that a good sense of humor is more important than good sex .
72 percent of german men believe that a woman 's sense of humor is as important as her looks . what so fu n n y about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a land of fun !
before we rush to judgment and proclaim that the germans are the new irish - cracking hilarious jokes in the face of adversity while celebrating life with passion and spontaneity - we should put things into perspective . another recent survey showed that only 15 percent of germans said that the best sex to be had was " made in germany . "
the overwhelming majority of germans looked wistfully towards italy for erotic inspiration -lrb- and probably thanked the eu for open borders -rrb- . the same study showed that germans were considerably less needy in the sack than other europeans .
while 25 percent of greeks boasted they needed sex at least five times a week , 65 percent of germans were satisfied with getting wild twice a week - or less . to joke or n ot to joke ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this german guy wants is a funny girl to giggle with so , if german men say that a sense of humor is more important than sex , what does that really mean ?
that they finds enough time in their busy schedules to laugh three times a week ?
or that a few german jokes a week are enough to satisfy their appetites , since they daydream anyway about luscious cicciolinas in the land of pizza , mozzarella , pasta and stracciatella ?
or that they expect so little from sex that they want to be able , at least , to laugh about it ? one thing we 've all learned from the recent german elections , however , is that we should n't trust polls .
it is unlikely that the germans will trade their traditional philosophical brooding for jolly carelessness any time soon , but we ca n't really be too sure . after all , at least one political organization - the german anarchist party - is already working hard on spicing up german sex life . or as dw-world reader emma storr from london put it : " some anarchy is needed to liberate germans from the shackle of benefits and improve their sex life . " with a little luck and a lot more discipline , the anarchists may transform germany into a blossoming landscape of erotic hilarity . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans ca n't get no ...

unfortunately i only corrected myself a few days afterwards .
i should not have given any figure . "

sign-posting inside the stadiums during the confederations cup was poor and led to confused fans helplessly searching for concession stands and toilets .
there were also too many people who were able to streak on to the field . " the general conclusion is that we accomplished 85 percent of what we imagined , " he said .
" that means we have to improve in every area because the demands of the world cup are much higher . " though stadium improvements remain necessary , they are running according to schedule .
stuttgart and kaiserslautern , the two stadiums still under construction , will be finished by december .

" it 's clear that a lot will have to happen between the end of the bundesliga on may 13 , 2006 and the beginning of the world cup on june 9 , " he said .
" there is n't a single stadium that could host a world cup match today . " however , he is still confident that if the german national team plays to the same standards as he 's demanding behind the scenes , the work will be worth it .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .
the complete design comes from the hand of architect kamel louafi , who was born in algeria and now lives in berlin .
german companies were in charge of basic construction , engineering the waterworks , paving and plantings . moroccan craftspeople came to berlin to carry out work on the more artistic areas of the garden .
their reliefs and tile work , ornaments such as the three-dimensional " muquarnas " and polygonal arabesques known as " zillij , " along with painting and calligraphy , give the garden its unmistakable appearance . " the whole time , the craftspeople had to struggle with the unfamiliar german building regulations , " louafi said . bildunterschrift : for example , a different kind of joint was required between the tiles than the one they were used to , and the grout even had to be especially frost-proofed . being in germany also requires plants that can survive the winter frost and taking the orange trees into the greenhouse in the winter , but these exigencies hardly disturb visitors to the berlin gardens . however , there is one " minor criticism " that is frequently voiced in the " oriental garden . "
as bachir saad and nadja fügert from germany said , they 'd like to enjoy a cup of aromatic mint tea or bitter arabic coffee here in the garden . " then everything would be perfect , " they said . ariana mirza -lrb- j. taylor-gaida -rrb- , © qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing european culture to ramallah germany and france are opening a joint cultural center in the west bank city of ramallah this weekend .

some see it as a way to introduce germans to islamic culture . " it looks like a fairytale castle . " " no , silly , you mean a fairytale garden . " eight-year-old henriette and her friend julia squeal with delight , trailing their fingers in the bubbling fountains that give the oriental garden courtyard " riyad " its nickname " garden of the four streams . " based on strict geometrical and proportional order , four small streams divide the inner courtyard , which is secluded from the outside world by four walls .
symmetrical arcades and vestibules take their place in the clearly defined composition along with the four fields that surround the center of the oasis with a profusion of blooms .
at the center stands a wooden pavilion containing a fountain basin , the stylized " source " of life . bildunterschrift : i n spired by the " heave n ly garde n " architect kamel louafi found his own sources of inspiration in the persian-arabian interpretation of " janna , " the " heavenly garden " described in the koran .
ever since the seventh century , this idea of the " garden of paradise " has shaped traditional islamic garden arts from north africa to india . the gardens of the alhambra in spain were the only example of this type of architecture in europe up until now .
but the complex in granada was built in the middle ages .
this is probably why many visitors to berlin 's " riyad " do not realize that such gardens of paradise are by no means an " extinct " manifestation of islamic culture . " i would never have thought that today they could still create something this ornate , " said 57-year-old reinhard jeda .
" it 's surrounded by walls , protecting it from view , a little bit like the orient for us europeans . " mrs. jeda , by contrast , " simply felt a heavenly peace " descend upon her as she entered . " fi n ally somethi n g from my world " a young syrian man , 27-year-old hammud , came to the garden with a group of friends .
he was particularly pleased that his german companions visiting the oriental garden with him " finally have the chance to see something from my world . " bildunterschrift : " harmonious ! " is the word most visitors spontaneously came up with to give their impression of the architecture of the islamic garden .
the only thing that 15-year-old claudia from zwickau liked even better than the berlin garden were " the gorgeous flowers in the gardens of tunisia , " where she once went on vacation . dang phan -lrb- 16 -rrb- , a berlin resident with a vietnamese background , has n't been to the orient yet .
but he considers the architecture with its ornamental splendor to be " a cliche of the orient " - after all , " it could never really be this idyllic in real life . " for helena siuts , there can be no doubt as to the authenticity of the garden .
" at the moment , i 'm reading a book about the doctor ibn sina , " she said .
" what i could previously only imagine is here to see in concrete form . " a germa n -arab co-productio n the planning and realization of the " oriental garden " involved a german-arab co-production .

the lenders ' decision endorses an initial agreement by the leaders of the g8 industrialised states at their july summit in gleneagles , scotland .
world bank head paul wolfowitz said the focus and effort must now shift to forging a global free-trade deal .
trade talks have stalled and officials will try to revive them in december .
the world trade organisation will meet in hong kong and try to breathe new life into the doha round of talks that fell apart amid differences over agricultural subsidies .
" the momentum we now have must be maintained heading into the wto negotiations in hong kong , " mr wolfowitz told a news conference .
" a trade agreement in hong kong would provide the spur for investment and economic growth that promises a lasting exit from poverty for millions , even billions , of people in developing countries , " he continued .
" we have agreement on more aid , we have consensus on debt relief - now let 's complete the picture and deliver a true development round on trade . "
' successful conclusion ' the world bank gave its blessing to the debt relief deal late on sunday , at the end of the lender 's annual series of meetings with the imf in washington .
countries to benefit benin , bolivia , burkina faso , ethiopia , ghana , guyana , honduras , madagascar , mali , mauritania , mozambique , nicaragua , niger , rwanda , senegal , tanzania , uganda , zambia the imf had already given its backing , and the two international lenders will now ask their executive boards to rubber stamp the agreement .
us treasury secretary john snow said the world bank 's development committee had " strongly endorsed the proposal for 100 % cancellation " of debts .
" we expect the executive boards of the imf and world bank to swiftly give final approval and move on to implementing it , " he said .
eighteen nations stand to have $ 40bn in debt written off initially , while $ 55bn could be released eventually , uk chancellor gordon mr brown said .
more action a number of countries , led by belgium and the netherlands , had complained that not enough money was being committed by rich nations to make up for the shortfall in funds that the world bank would face if debt repayments were forgiven .
but a joint-pledge by the g8 on friday not to dilute the resources of the international financial institutions overcame opposition and the debtor nations could start benefiting by the end of 2005 .
the debt issue explored at-a-glance about 70 % of the debt is owed to the world bank , while the rest is owed to the imf and the african development bank .
campaign groups had earlier welcomed the imf 's decision , but said the g8 's proposals needed to be widened to include more poorer nations .
" this announcement brings a welcome sigh of relief , but the deal still needs to be expanded to include more countries and to eliminate harmful strings attached , " actionaid said .
the debt deal reached in scotland is regarded as a crucial step towards meeting the united nations ' millennium development goals of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015 .
it was backed by britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .

the lenders ' decision endorses an initial agreement by the leaders of the g8 industrialised states at their july summit in gleneagles , scotland .
world bank head paul wolfowitz said the focus and effort must now shift to forging a global free-trade deal .
trade talks have stalled and officials will try to revive them in december .
the world trade organisation will meet in hong kong and try to breathe new life into the doha round of talks that fell apart amid differences over agricultural subsidies .
" the momentum we now have must be maintained heading into the wto negotiations in hong kong , " mr wolfowitz told a news conference .
" a trade agreement in hong kong would provide the spur for investment and economic growth that promises a lasting exit from poverty for millions , even billions , of people in developing countries , " he continued .
" we have agreement on more aid , we have consensus on debt relief - now let 's complete the picture and deliver a true development round on trade . "
' successful conclusion ' the world bank gave its blessing to the debt relief deal late on sunday , at the end of the lender 's annual series of meetings with the imf in washington .
countries to benefit benin , bolivia , burkina faso , ethiopia , ghana , guyana , honduras , madagascar , mali , mauritania , mozambique , nicaragua , niger , rwanda , senegal , tanzania , uganda , zambia the imf had already given its backing , and the two international lenders will now ask their executive boards to rubber stamp the agreement .
us treasury secretary john snow said the world bank 's development committee had " strongly endorsed the proposal for 100 % cancellation " of debts .
" we expect the executive boards of the imf and world bank to swiftly give final approval and move on to implementing it , " he said .
eighteen nations stand to have $ 40bn in debt written off initially , while $ 55bn could be released eventually , uk chancellor gordon mr brown said .
more action a number of countries , led by belgium and the netherlands , had complained that not enough money was being committed by rich nations to make up for the shortfall in funds that the world bank would face if debt repayments were forgiven .
but a joint-pledge by the g8 on friday not to dilute the resources of the international financial institutions overcame opposition and the debtor nations could start benefiting by the end of 2005 .
the debt issue explored at-a-glance about 70 % of the debt is owed to the world bank , while the rest is owed to the imf and the african development bank .
campaign groups had earlier welcomed the imf 's decision , but said the g8 's proposals needed to be widened to include more poorer nations .
" this announcement brings a welcome sigh of relief , but the deal still needs to be expanded to include more countries and to eliminate harmful strings attached , " actionaid said .
the debt deal reached in scotland is regarded as a crucial step towards meeting the united nations ' millennium development goals of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015 .
it was backed by britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us .

almost 20,000 boeing machinists at plants in kansas , oregon and washington state downed tools at the start of this month , delaying plane deliveries .
analysts estimated that a month long strike could have cost boeing more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.1bn -rrb- .
union representatives said workers will vote on the deal on thursday .
" i 'm just proud of our membership , " said workers ' representative mark blondin , district president for machinists district lodge 751 in seattle .
" they stood solid , unified , and that solidarity is what finally got the company to do the right thing . "
better offer the deal is reasonable and was reached after both sides made compromises , said boeing spokesman charles bickers .
the three-year deal was reached after boeing pledged not to make changes to its healthcare programme , despite rising costs , trade union official mr blondin told the associated press news agency .
it also agreed to keep offering medical benefits to retired workers .
boeing had been looking to gain higher contributions from its workers .
the company will pay more in pensions to union members , increasing the monthly payout to $ 70 per month for every year worked , up from $ 60 .
boeing had previously offered $ 66 .
workers who sign up for the deal will receive an 8 % bonus in the first year , plus $ 3,000 in each of the next two years .
boeing also agreed to offer the same terms to all workers , dropping plans to give less money to those they reckoned had a cheaper cost of living .
