as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

the 22-second film , which has been making the rounds on the internet , shows an arab-looking man with a palestinian scarf driving a vw polo through a city where he pulls up in front of a crowded cafe and sets off a bomb in his car .
the polo and the surroundings remain unscathed and the slogan " small but tough " appears .
in a german version , the phrase reads " extremely well-built " .
vw spokesman hartwig von sass described the clip as " violence-glorifying , cynical and criminal " and said it amounted to " an attack on volkswagen 's good reputation " .
sass said a steering wheel on the right-hand side , the license plate and the appearance of a london taxi in the background of the film indicated that it had been shot in the british capital .
he said he could not confirm reports that a london advertising agency had made it but said it was in any case not an agency that worked with volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.01.2005 -pipe- 16:00 utc vw mulls legal action on fake terror ad german automaker volkswagen said it had filed a complaint against the makers of a video clip depicting a suicide bombing using one of its cars .
the 22-second film , which has been making the rounds on the internet , shows an arab-looking man with a palestinian scarf driving a vw polo through a city where he pulls up in front of a crowded cafe and sets off a bomb in his car .
the polo and the surroundings remain unscathed and the slogan " small but tough " appears .
in a german version , the phrase reads " extremely well-built " .
vw spokesman hartwig von sass described the clip as " violence-glorifying , cynical and criminal " and said it amounted to " an attack on volkswagen 's good reputation " .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .

more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .

" pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .

since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.01.2005 fighting illiteracy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you find a job if you ca n't read or write ?
two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .
there 's much to be done to reach that goal - even in germany . christiane wolters -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .

robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .

sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote . " no one in their right mind would glorify the raf , " baum told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.01.2005 fighting illiteracy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you find a job if you ca n't read or write ?
two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .
there 's much to be done to reach that goal - even in germany . christiane wolters -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .
but now they can benefit from some private tutoring courtesy of the finnish embassy 's new website , which has a few tips on how to catch up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.01.2005 fighting illiteracy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you find a job if you ca n't read or write ?
two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .
there 's much to be done to reach that goal - even in germany . christiane wolters -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .

more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.01.2005 ministers aim to tackle poverty with trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos more than 20 trade ministers met with the head of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- in switzerland on saturday amid warnings that global trade talks were a crucial building block in an anti-poverty drive this year . wto director general supachai panitchpakdi said on the sidelines of the world economic forum here that he was trying to " step up the pressure " with a view to completing the outlines of an agreement on cutting trade barriers by the end of 2005 . several political leaders in the swiss town of davos underlined that the completion of a new round of trade liberalization , aimed primarily at helping developing countries , was an essential part of a boosted aid effort . " we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.01.2005 fighting illiteracy in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how do you find a job if you ca n't read or write ?
two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .
there 's much to be done to reach that goal - even in germany . christiane wolters -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .
there 's much to be done to reach that goal - even in germany . christiane wolters -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a finnish lesson for german students according to pisa , german students lack essential educational skills .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.01.2005 ministers aim to tackle poverty with trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos more than 20 trade ministers met with the head of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- in switzerland on saturday amid warnings that global trade talks were a crucial building block in an anti-poverty drive this year . wto director general supachai panitchpakdi said on the sidelines of the world economic forum here that he was trying to " step up the pressure " with a view to completing the outlines of an agreement on cutting trade barriers by the end of 2005 . several political leaders in the swiss town of davos underlined that the completion of a new round of trade liberalization , aimed primarily at helping developing countries , was an essential part of a boosted aid effort . " we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .

baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .

since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.01.2005 ministers aim to tackle poverty with trade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos more than 20 trade ministers met with the head of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- in switzerland on saturday amid warnings that global trade talks were a crucial building block in an anti-poverty drive this year . wto director general supachai panitchpakdi said on the sidelines of the world economic forum here that he was trying to " step up the pressure " with a view to completing the outlines of an agreement on cutting trade barriers by the end of 2005 . several political leaders in the swiss town of davos underlined that the completion of a new round of trade liberalization , aimed primarily at helping developing countries , was an essential part of a boosted aid effort . " we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .

sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote . " no one in their right mind would glorify the raf , " baum told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2005 opinion : a shadow over german soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer is at the center of a match-fixing scandal german soccer has struggled recently .
as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .

two years into the united nations literacy decade , educators have been tackling the problem of illiteracy where many assumed it was n't a problem : in germany . although attending school until the age of 16 is mandatory in germany , around 4 million people here are still functional illiterates .
they may have gone to school for years , but they read and write so poorly that it 's hard for them to lead a normal life . " when one takes as a basis the fact alone that in germany each year 80,000 secondary school pupils leave school without a diploma , it 's certainly an alarming number , " according to monika tröster of the german institute for adult education .
" among this group there are many who ca n't read and write well enough .
if one has n't learned reading in the first two school years , there 's no more chance to really make up for it . " illiteracy was long ignored in germany or dismissed as a problem in poorer , less developed countries .
indeed , most of the world 's 800 million illiterates live in developing countries .
but particularly since the pisa studies carried out by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- showed that pupils here lag far behind their peers in other highly developed countries , educators and the public have realized that many schoolchildren find it tough to write correct german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if children do n't learn to read and write early on , they may not be able to catch up later and schools and teachers ca n't do much to help , which they are usually aware of , according to jürgen genuneit of the german illiteracy association bundesverband alphabetisierung . " pupils feel like they 've been written off and they also get written off .
no one attends to their problems anymore , " genuneit explained .
" in the worst case , the teacher makes a deal with the pupil : if you do n't disturb me , i wo n't disturb you .
but school are also too overextended to start again in the 6th , 7th or 8th grade to teach pupils reading . " everyday barriers for most illiterates , the problems really start once they 've left school .
they find it hard to apply for jobs or even read bus schedules or check their bank statements .
along with such daily difficulties , their sense of shame often grows .
few people are willing to admit they ca n't write . so they devise tricks to hide their weaknesses .
genuneit told of a woman who worked in a kitchen for years but managed to avoid revealing her illiteracy . when the boss came for her to write out the shopping list , she put her finger in the deep-fryer so she had a big blister .
or she quickly grabbed the trash bag and took out the trash .
those examples show what one is willing to do so no one discovers that one ca n't read or write . " getting beyond shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations literacy decade , launched in 2003 , may also shed more light on the issue in germany .
since it started , the alliance for alphabetization and basic education was set up by numerous educational groups to track down and help people who are illiterate .
their internet project , apoll , runs a web site financed by the education ministry where people can learn to read and write . " the advantages that we have with the use of the internet are : it does n't matter when i learn , how long i learn or where i learn , " explained educator martin ragg from apoll .
" that means that an adult functional illiterate can decide himself how long he wants to study .
what 's very important is that we have much more traffic from people who want to remain anonymous .
they only have to give a nickname to get a password from us .
they 're coached by online-tutors and can start to learn immediately , without revealing their identity . " the un literacy decade aims to halve the number of illiterates worldwide by 2015 .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote . " no one in their right mind would glorify the raf , " baum told reporters .
" the politicians have n't gone to the trouble of looking deeper at what the exhibition can tell us .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote . " no one in their right mind would glorify the raf , " baum told reporters .
" the politicians have n't gone to the trouble of looking deeper at what the exhibition can tell us .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

" we must have aid , trade and debt relief at the same time , " french finance minister herve gaymard said as he joined britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown to campaign for a huge boost to rich country help for africa this year . the trade talks - which have been dominated by efforts to break down subsidies in agriculture - have been dogged since 2001 by disputes between rich and poor countries that have almost led to their collapse . " if we do n't move on agriculture , we will have a more and more divided world between the rich countries and the poor countries , " luiz furlan , brazil 's industry and trade minister told the forum . during the informal meeting with ministers in a hotel here , supachai will ask them to map out their objectives for trade talks by february 14 , the date of a trade negotiations committee meeting in geneva .
that would give a december wto ministerial conference in hong kong a chance to seal the key elements of an agreement , leaving only technical details to be completed in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , wto , director general supachai panitchpakdi .
more progress needed " they have moved , but they have not moved far enough to guarantee what i would see as a real progress at hong kong , " supachai said . shortly before the meeting , the top us trade official , robert zoellick , said the round of trade talks launched in doha , qatar in 2001 , was part of the us administration 's " transformational agenda " aimed at harnessing stable economic growth . " in particular , the doha agenda provides a tremendous opportunity for dealing with some of these growth issues , " the us trade representative said , adding that 300 million people could be lifted out of poverty .
while the round was lifted out of deadlock with an interim agreement to refocus the talks last summer , the 148 member states were confronted with several challenges including the growing global economic importance of china and india , zoellick added . " it fits nicely with the doha agenda , because these are two rising economic powers , it 's critical we integrate them into the system .
you can see that china and india are going to be the core , " zoellick said , underlining that it was also a question of their relations with poor countries " as you can see in the textile area . " china 's clothing exports are expected to receive a huge boost , largely at the expense of smaller textile-exporting developing countries , from the end of wto textile quotas at the beginning of january .
although detailed discussion was not expected in davos , supachai said he might raise the issue of setting an end-date for the elimination of export subsidies in agriculture . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany supports eu-mercosur deal german foreign minister joschka fischer has said berlin will fight to salvage a deal between the eu and the four-nation south american mercosur trade bloc aimed at building the world 's largest free-trade area .

as bundesliga teams flounder in europe , the national side is trying to rebuild after a devastating euro 2004 .
german referees were the only thing considered world class .
not anymore . germany may have become runner-up to brazil in the last world cup , but since then not much has gone right for german soccer .
last season , bundesliga teams exited early from europe 's top club competition the champion 's league and the national side was humiliated during the euro 2004 in portugal last summer . on top of that , german soccer has long had an image problem .
none of the flash of italian , spanish or brazilian incarnations of the game and lacking the grit and determination of the english variant was the most common assessment .
at best , german soccer , which has undeniably had its moments , was considered ' workmanlike ' and efficient . that reputation of being hardworking and straightforward extended to german referees , which have been held in high standing internationally .
german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- ref markus merk was even voted the world 's best in 2004 , exemplifying how fair and impartial german officials were thought to be .
though dr merk 's integrity may be beyond doubt , the same unfortunately ca n't be said for some of his colleagues . scandal on the pitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's sergej barbarez -lrb- l -rrb- challenging robert hoyzer in paderborn .
robert hoyzer , an up-and-coming referee , recently admitted that he manipulated a german cup match between lowly sc paderborn and bundesliga side hamburg sv .
hoyzer 's decisions during the cup first round match in august last year handed the result to paderborn .
he has said the corruption goes beyond his own personal misdeeds and has ties to the croatian underworld in germany .
on saturday , reports surfaced that three players from berlin 's bundesliga team hertha bsc are also being investigated . the revelations have shaken the dfb and unleashed the country 's biggest soccer scandal in three decades .
betting on fixed matches is , of course , nothing new and german soccer officials can do little against someone determinedly willing to manipulate the results for their own financial gain .
but the incident could n't have come at a worse time . germany is gearing up to hold the 2006 world cup .
any sleaze that sticks to the dfb could end up tarnishing the tournament 17 months from now .
there were already grumblings when germany won the right to host the world cup that there were backroom fifa dealings that eventually torpedoed the chances of frontrunner south africa . germany 's reputation and if german soccer does n't have the reputation of being professional and fair , what does it have ?
marketing-wise the bundesliga certainly ca n't compete with england 's premier league , italy 's serie a or spain 's la liga .
beyond the lacking star power , germany 's top league suffers from the same preconceptions that haunt the national team : namely that german soccer is n't offensive enough and there are n't enough goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann .
sadly , the match-fixing incident comes just as the german game seemed to be shaking off its reputation as being dull .
this bundesliga season has seen a flurry of high-scoring games and the new coach of germany 's national side , jürgen klinsmann , has injected a good dose of attacking soccer into the team .
hopefully he will banish forever the days when the germans would score a goal from a free kick and then place all 11 men in the penalty box to wait out the clock .
but that could matter little if the referee scandal continues to widen .
german fans , who rightly feel they have been cheated , could withdraw their support , as they did during a similar spate of match-fixing in the early 70 's .
dfb officials will have to move quickly to restore confidence in german soccer , both at home and abroad . it will be a long road , but not one entirely without hope : germany managed to win the last world cup it hosted in 1974 only a couple of years after scandal previously tainted the country 's soccer league . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bent german referee admits match-rigging robert hoyzer , the referee in the middle of germany 's biggest soccer scandal for 34 years , admitted match-fixing on thursday , a day after suspicions of mafia involvement were raised in the case against him .

the raf came to prominence during the most affluent years of the west german recovery in the late 1960s .
born out of the student protest movement in the 1960s , the raf emerged from the baader-meinhof gang , founded by andreas baader and ulrike meinhof . violence in the name of class struggle the organization , based around baader 's hardcore group , was a network of cells commited to violence in the service of the class struggle .
it attacked not just germany 's rich and powerful , but also us military installations which through the group 's obscure mix of marxist and maoist ideology it saw as emblems of american imperialism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf began their campaign with bomb attacks on german department stores .
by pooling the resources from its web of activists and supporters which provided logistic and propaganda support , the raf carried out a number of bombings , assassinations , kidnappings , and robberies throughout the 60s and 70s in terrorist actions they claimed were by disgust with what they saw as the mindless materialism and fascist tendencies of german society . even after the originators of the movement had been killed or arrested , the raf continued sporadic operations throughout the 1980s and early 1990s before officially disbanding in 1998 . current climate proved problematic for project in the current climate of worldwide condemnation for international terror , an exhibition dedicated to showing works of art based on a group which attempted to achieve its aim through the bomb and the gun has caused problems for the kw institute of contemporary art . when plans for the exhibition were revealed , its future was immediately thrown into doubt by the vocal opposition the proposed project was receiving from on high .
many german politicians complained vehemently that the exhibition would glorify germany 's homegrown terror group . " the exhibition should be cancelled without any ifs or buts , " the oppostion christian democratic union 's laurenz meyer announced when the plans first came to light in 2003 .
he said at the time that it the raf was not about " ideals , but about terror and the murder of innocents . " his party colleague , rupert scholz , condemned the exhibition in even sharper tones . " an exhibition like the one apparently initiated here is absolutely unacceptable .
in reality , it is a scandal , " he told a radio station at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus biesenbach such was the furor that klaus biesenbach , founder and former director of the institute , withdrew an application for € 100,000 -lrb- $ 133,000 -rrb- worth of state funding .
with it went the prospect of realizing this particular project sooner rather than later , but biesenbach was not about to scratch it from the canvas altogether . despite leaving the kw institute for the museum of modern art in new york last year , biesenbach 's vision of raising the € 350,000 needed to stage the show without state assistance lived on . internet art auction raised funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist doug aitken 's " girl in mask -lrb- 2002 -rrb- " was one of the works of art auctioned on ebay .
under the guidance of the project 's new curators , ellen blumenstein and playwright felix ensslin , the son of raf terrorist gudrun ensslin , 14 renowned artists , including doug aitken , monica bonvicini , jane and louise wilson and saatchi favorites dinos and jake chapman auctioned pieces of work on ebay and donated the proceeds to the artistic cause . along with philanthropic donations from the netherlands and switzerland , the kw institute achieved its goal of financing the raf-related works of some 40 different artists , including jörg immendorff , gerhard richter , scott king , joseph beuys and sue de beer . former minister criticizes modern apathy the exhibition has received some unusual patronage in the form of gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party .
baum , who held office between 1978 and 1982 , said he believes that " regarding terror : the raf exhibition " is an important event that has been misunderstood . baum said the era which gave birth to the raf was one where the public was more aware of the social issues and problems that gave rise to armed struggle .
in the years that followed , according to baum , people have become apathetic to such problems and have stopped questioning their causes . exhibit provokes thought , claims baum as such , events like the sept .
11 attacks have surprised people and although measures are being taken to combat terrorism , baum said that governments are just reacting without looking deeper at the underlying causes , something he thinks the exhibition is attempting to promote . " no one in their right mind would glorify the raf , " baum told reporters .
" the politicians have n't gone to the trouble of looking deeper at what the exhibition can tell us .

the latest twist came hours after the supreme court rejected a final appeal to save michael ross , who murdered eight women aged 14 to 25 in the 1980s .
his execution by lethal injection would be connecticut 's first for 45 years .
his attorney said he was seeking the postponement for 48 hours because of a possible conflict of interest .

his request apparently came as a result of a phone call from a district court judge , robert chatigny , who put a restraining order on the execution last monday .
judge chatigny accused mr paulding of withholding information about ross ' competence to waive his appeals , and the lawyer said he would spend the weekend considering " appropriate steps " .

the latest twist came hours after the supreme court rejected a final appeal to save michael ross , who murdered eight women aged 14 to 25 in the 1980s .
his execution by lethal injection would be connecticut 's first for 45 years .
his attorney said he was seeking the postponement for 48 hours because of a possible conflict of interest .
lawyer tr paulding said that his client had not requested the delay .
his request apparently came as a result of a phone call from a district court judge , robert chatigny , who put a restraining order on the execution last monday .
judge chatigny accused mr paulding of withholding information about ross ' competence to waive his appeals , and the lawyer said he would spend the weekend considering " appropriate steps " .
the execution has now been put back from 0201 -lrb- 0701 gmt -rrb- on saturday to 2100 on monday -lrb- 0200 gmt tuesday -rrb- .
final appeal ross spent 17 years fighting against his execution , but recently changed his mind .
i respect the judges on this panel , but they got it dead wrong antonio ponvert lawyer for dan ross , father of michael judge chatigny put a restraining order on the execution based on affidavits from what he said were " serious people " that the killer was not competent .
a federal appeals court reversed the decision on friday , saying it could find no case law establishing the right of relatives to challenge the death sentence on their own behalf .
but it stayed its order to allow an appeal by ross ' father dan to the supreme court , which was rejected late on friday .
dan ross ' lawyer antonio ponvert said the appeals court had made a mistake .
" i respect the judges on this panel , but they got it dead wrong , " he told the associated press news agency .
" there is without question sufficiently serious questions on the merits of this case to make them fair game for litigation . "
' cruel and inhumane ' connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal said that if ross decided at the last minute to appeal against the execution , " the machinery of death will stop " .
the last person to be executed in connecticut was joseph " mad dog " taborsky .
he went to the electric chair in 1960 .
since then the state has replaced electrocution with lethal injection , but human rights group the american civil liberties union of connecticut believes it is a " cruel and inhumane " procedure .

six flights from mainland china touched down in taipei , and a taiwanese airliner landed in beijing on saturday .
dancing lions and dragons greeted the first flights to arrive on both sides , and beaming passengers said they hoped the flights would become permanent .
taiwan has banned flights to mainland china for more than half a century for what it called security reasons .
over the next three weeks , 48 flights are scheduled for the lunar new year holidays , also linking beijing and shanghai with taiwan .
the resumption of the service marks a rare agreement across the taiwan strait , but underlying tensions between the two governments still remain .
saturday 's flights will have to pass through hong kong or macau air space , but they do not have to stop there , slashing flight times by three hours .
' taiwan in time for dinner ' the first flight to land in taipei came from guangzhou in china .
the 277 passengers on board were greeted by officials , taiwanese lawmakers , and a huge crowd of reporters as they walked under an arch of red and yellow balloons after landing .
they mainly comprised taiwanese business people and their families who live and work in china and are coming home to celebrate the lunar new year on 9 february , the most important holiday on the chinese calendar .
hundreds of thousands of taiwanese people work in china " we hope this historic flight can soon bring about regular air service so we taiwanese business people can have lunch on the mainland and get back to taiwan in time for dinner , " businessman wu chien-chang told ap news agency .
at least 300,000 taiwanese live and work on the mainland and until saturday they have had to fly an indirect route back to taiwan , changing planes at a third destination , a journey which is both time consuming and expensive , says the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei .
later taiwan 's biggest carrier china airlines made its first flight to beijing , landing nearly half an hour early , and five more flights arrived in taipei from beijing and shanghai .
taiwan and china remain political foes .
beijing sees taiwan as a breakaway province , and it will not deal with the government of president chen shui-bian , who is traditionally seen as pro-independence .
however , economic ties are booming , says our correspondent .
bilateral trade rose to $ 70bn dollars in 2004 , up by more than 34 % from 2003 .
while china downplayed the landmark flights , taiwanese officials called them a historic milestone which could form the basis of future exchanges and talks between the two sides .
but they have also warned that plans by china to enact an anti-secession law aimed at blocking taiwanese independence could jeopardise that opportunity and even prove a major setback to future cross-strait ties .

castel deputy tom le pelley says the island must change its ways immediately now that plans for a waste to energy plant are on hold .
a report by the waste to energy plant inquiry panel has concluded the proposed £ 80m scheme is the wrong choice for guernsey .
deputy le pelley now wants the island to start recycling more immediately .
other options he says it makes no sense to put recyclable material into the landfill site , nor simply to burn it for energy .
he wants to see much more separation of waste at source .
the independent panel was set up six months ago to review the plans for the incinerator at long hougue in st sampson 's after deputy scott ogier successfully persuaded the states to take a second look at the project .
the panel concluded the proposed plant was too big , would have a huge visual impact and would cost more than similar plants elsewhere .
it recommended the states look at other options and consider exporting some of its rubbish in the meantime .
the environment department has two months to consider the findings of the panel .

it follows a successful pilot scheme by the county council last september in which cameras were put on four buses serving secondary schools .
the four schools , in wem , much wenlock , oswestry and pontesbury , reported a fall in complaints about unruly behaviour by 82 % .
the plan to add three more cameras is due to be discussed at a council meeting next wednesday .
if it gets the go-ahead , they will be installed by the end of march .
thomas adams school in wem , william brookes in much wenlock , rhyn park in oswestry , and mary webb school & science college in pontesbury were chosen for the pilot scheme .
a county council spokesman said : " the high quality of the pictures has meant quick and clear identification of misbehaving pupils , and schools have quickly been able to deal with incidents .
" as a result , reports of misbehaviour and vandalism have all but been eliminated , and we have received nothing but praise for the initiative from the bus companies , schools and parents . "

the home secretary in london wants to introduce new trespass laws to scotland .
sex education has been on the agenda at the scottish parliament the scottish executive wants its sexual health strategy to apply to catholic schools .
and the scottish national party wants tony blair to call a general election on 5 may .
at first minister 's question time , the snp 's nicola sturgeon condemned jack mcconnell for planning to hand over responsibility for new trespass laws in scotland to westminster .
" it would be an offence , " she said , " simply to be on land owned by the queen , to walk your dog on the balmoral estate .
that clearly overturns the will of this parliament " .
she reminded msps it was just two years ago that the " right to roam " was enshrined in scots law .
final say mr mcconnell said it was mischievous to suggest the home secretary 's new law would apply to the whole of the queen 's estates .
it would only apply to the three royal residences in scotland : balmoral castle ; nearby birkhall house and the palace of holyroodhouse in edinburgh .
moreover , the " sewel motion " to be put to parliament next week would give scottish ministers the final say on which areas would be designated for the new trespass law .
the liberal democrats , like the snp , fear that other areas may be " designated " as trespass zones in the future .
jack mcconnell accused nationalists of mischief-making they are threatening to vote against the sewel motion next wednesday , unless they are reassured .
the conservatives believe there are too many sewel motions being pushed through the scottish parliament - 56 at the last count .
as david mcletchie put it , " there 's more than a hint that they are being used for reasons of political expediency and in an inconsistent manner " .
the procedures committee has already begun an inquiry into the issue .
and the first minister did suggest at question time that the whole devolution act might need to be reviewed in the future to give more powers to scottish ministers , rather than having to win them back each time through sewel motions .
sewel motions formally pass to westminster the right to legislate on devolved scottish matters which are part of a wider uk bill .
time of devolution mr mcconnell maintains that on each occasion they have been used it has been a sensible use of parliamentary time and they have given scottish ministers powers they would otherwise not have .
this week , two other sewel motions went through the scottish parliament unopposed .
one gives scottish ministers more powers over the railways .
the other gives them more powers over how the national lottery is run .
the snp 's nicola sturgeon was not happy about trespass laws sewel motions were invented at the time of devolution by john buttifant sewel .
he is a man steeped in the intricacy of politics , vice-principal of aberdeen university , once a scottish fisheries minister and now a labour member of the house of lords .
a clue to the subtlety of sewel motions is that he lists as one of his hobbies " watching cricket " .
the other big talking point at holyrood has been sex .
on thursday health minister andy kerr announced the executive 's long awaited sexual health strategy .
the formula is " delay until you 're ready but be safe when you 're active " .
teenage pregnancies he announced an extra £ 5m a year for advice services to make sure teenagers had access to information and professional help when they need it .
but having come under pressure from the catholic church , he made it clear that there would be no change to sex education in schools , no issuing of " morning-after " pills and no fast-tracked abortions .
the former health minister susan deacon pointed out that the money was half that being allocated per head in england , despite the fact that , at over 9,000 a year , the rate of teenage pregnancy in scotland is the highest in western europe .
on tuesday , the snp somehow figured out that the prime minister is to call a general election on 5 may .
the right to roam on balmoral estate was a matter of debate and since it was burn 's day , and exactly 100 days to go , the snp leader alex salmond felt inspired to call a dramatic press conference in the dynamic earth building , across the road from the parliament , to declare his party 's election campaign under way .
he highlighted his main themes as better pensions , no more nuclear power , the saving of the six scottish regiments and no more " illegal " wars like iraq .
strictly speaking these are nothing to do with the devolved scottish parliament .
but it did n't stop msps debating pensions and nuclear power this week .
the snp outlined their non-means-tested citizen 's pension in a debate on elderly people on wednesday afternoon .
and on thursday morning , the conservatives made it pretty clear they were in favour of building a new nuclear power station in scotland sooner rather than later .
executive budget they said it was the only realistic way of tackling climate change , the subject of a round table discussion on wednesday morning at the environment committee .
experts from the environmental organisations , from the universities and big business were called in to suggest ways of how scotland could cut its greenhouse gas emissions .
the parliament 's most important function was duly performed this week .
the scottish executive 's budget for next year , £ 27bn , was approved by 63 votes to 13 with the snp abstaining .
the issues had all been decided months ago , around the cabinet table .
finally , a little house keeping .
we seem to have to do a lot of this at holyrood .
the national lottery is the subject of a sewel motion this week the members of the management committee , the grotesquely named corporate body , submitted themselves to a formal question and answer session in the chamber on wednesday afternoon .
it was a curiously tame affair .
critics margo macdonald and fergus ewing were given short shrift by the spokesman for the corporate body , robert brown , and we soon moved on to the other 10 questions about such interesting matters as crèche numbers and parliamentary passes .
we learnt this week too that the new holyrood building is not worth the £ 430m we paid for it .
it 's been insured for just £ 380m .
and at the other end of the expenses scale , the parliamentary authorities have called in their accountants to check through the travelling expenses of the liberal democrat keith raffan .
you may remember he resigned earlier this month on health grounds .
but not until he had claimed over £ 40,000 in back dated mileage .
it appears that one of his claims , to a meeting in kirkcaldy , was on a day when he was due to be on official business in the isle of man .
he says he 's now checking through his own records .
it 's probably only a slip of the diary and of course we forgive those who trespass against us .

the home secretary in london wants to introduce new trespass laws to scotland .
sex education has been on the agenda at the scottish parliament the scottish executive wants its sexual health strategy to apply to catholic schools .
and the scottish national party wants tony blair to call a general election on 5 may .
at first minister 's question time , the snp 's nicola sturgeon condemned jack mcconnell for planning to hand over responsibility for new trespass laws in scotland to westminster .
" it would be an offence , " she said , " simply to be on land owned by the queen , to walk your dog on the balmoral estate .
that clearly overturns the will of this parliament " .
she reminded msps it was just two years ago that the " right to roam " was enshrined in scots law .
final say mr mcconnell said it was mischievous to suggest the home secretary 's new law would apply to the whole of the queen 's estates .
it would only apply to the three royal residences in scotland : balmoral castle ; nearby birkhall house and the palace of holyroodhouse in edinburgh .
moreover , the " sewel motion " to be put to parliament next week would give scottish ministers the final say on which areas would be designated for the new trespass law .
the liberal democrats , like the snp , fear that other areas may be " designated " as trespass zones in the future .
jack mcconnell accused nationalists of mischief-making they are threatening to vote against the sewel motion next wednesday , unless they are reassured .
the conservatives believe there are too many sewel motions being pushed through the scottish parliament - 56 at the last count .
as david mcletchie put it , " there 's more than a hint that they are being used for reasons of political expediency and in an inconsistent manner " .
the procedures committee has already begun an inquiry into the issue .
and the first minister did suggest at question time that the whole devolution act might need to be reviewed in the future to give more powers to scottish ministers , rather than having to win them back each time through sewel motions .
sewel motions formally pass to westminster the right to legislate on devolved scottish matters which are part of a wider uk bill .
time of devolution mr mcconnell maintains that on each occasion they have been used it has been a sensible use of parliamentary time and they have given scottish ministers powers they would otherwise not have .
this week , two other sewel motions went through the scottish parliament unopposed .
one gives scottish ministers more powers over the railways .
the other gives them more powers over how the national lottery is run .
the snp 's nicola sturgeon was not happy about trespass laws sewel motions were invented at the time of devolution by john buttifant sewel .
he is a man steeped in the intricacy of politics , vice-principal of aberdeen university , once a scottish fisheries minister and now a labour member of the house of lords .
a clue to the subtlety of sewel motions is that he lists as one of his hobbies " watching cricket " .
the other big talking point at holyrood has been sex .
on thursday health minister andy kerr announced the executive 's long awaited sexual health strategy .
the formula is " delay until you 're ready but be safe when you 're active " .
teenage pregnancies he announced an extra £ 5m a year for advice services to make sure teenagers had access to information and professional help when they need it .
but having come under pressure from the catholic church , he made it clear that there would be no change to sex education in schools , no issuing of " morning-after " pills and no fast-tracked abortions .
the former health minister susan deacon pointed out that the money was half that being allocated per head in england , despite the fact that , at over 9,000 a year , the rate of teenage pregnancy in scotland is the highest in western europe .
on tuesday , the snp somehow figured out that the prime minister is to call a general election on 5 may .
the right to roam on balmoral estate was a matter of debate and since it was burn 's day , and exactly 100 days to go , the snp leader alex salmond felt inspired to call a dramatic press conference in the dynamic earth building , across the road from the parliament , to declare his party 's election campaign under way .
he highlighted his main themes as better pensions , no more nuclear power , the saving of the six scottish regiments and no more " illegal " wars like iraq .
strictly speaking these are nothing to do with the devolved scottish parliament .
but it did n't stop msps debating pensions and nuclear power this week .
the snp outlined their non-means-tested citizen 's pension in a debate on elderly people on wednesday afternoon .
and on thursday morning , the conservatives made it pretty clear they were in favour of building a new nuclear power station in scotland sooner rather than later .
executive budget they said it was the only realistic way of tackling climate change , the subject of a round table discussion on wednesday morning at the environment committee .
experts from the environmental organisations , from the universities and big business were called in to suggest ways of how scotland could cut its greenhouse gas emissions .
the parliament 's most important function was duly performed this week .
the scottish executive 's budget for next year , £ 27bn , was approved by 63 votes to 13 with the snp abstaining .
the issues had all been decided months ago , around the cabinet table .

we learnt this week too that the new holyrood building is not worth the £ 430m we paid for it .
it 's been insured for just £ 380m .
and at the other end of the expenses scale , the parliamentary authorities have called in their accountants to check through the travelling expenses of the liberal democrat keith raffan .
you may remember he resigned earlier this month on health grounds .
but not until he had claimed over £ 40,000 in back dated mileage .
it appears that one of his claims , to a meeting in kirkcaldy , was on a day when he was due to be on official business in the isle of man .
he says he 's now checking through his own records .
it 's probably only a slip of the diary and of course we forgive those who trespass against us .

the destruction at lincoln prison in october 2002 was the worst disturbance at a british jail for 11 years .
prisoners seized control of the jail for eight hours during the riot .
twenty-one inmates received sentences for prison mutiny , assault and unlawful wounding , and violent disorder , getting a total of 97 years in prison .
the extent of the disorder emerged on friday as the last of the inmates involved was sentenced .
it was sheer lawlessness gordon aspden , prosecuting the background to the riot - including anger over the loss of hot meals from the jail canteen 's lunchtime menu - was revealed in court .
earlier hearings could not be reported until the end of all proceedings , which wrapped up on friday .

some sex-offenders feigned death as the rioters exploded oxygen cylinders in an attempt to blow open their cell doors .
mr aspden said : " there was discontent about changes to the prison menu and the introduction of sandwiches at lunchtime .
" a group of ringleaders were responsible for starting the trouble , but once the mutiny was in progress other inmates took the opportunity to join in .
" it was sheer lawlessness .
there were numerous assaults on other prisoners , and everything that came to hand was damaged or destroyed .
" absolutely no mercy was shown .
for over eight hours the prison was in the hands of the inmates .
it was anarchy . "
' anarchy and mayhem ' some 168 prison riot officers brought from jails up to 150 miles away took over again at the jail at 0400 bst on 24 october .
one prisoner died after taking an overdose of drugs looted from the pharmacy , while another 35 people needed hospital treatment .
judge heath , who passed the last of the sentences on friday , added : " there was anarchy and mayhem .
the prison was in the hands of the prisoners for about eight hours . "

" a gentleman on a horse enquired of the gentlemen of the fourth estate gathered on the side of a muddy country lane just outside the prime minister 's country residence .
the scene appeared a world away from abductions in west belfast and loughinisland and bank employees being forced by armed men to empty their own vault .
nevertheless , news of the country 's biggest bank robbery had reached this part of rural buckinghamshire .
" ah , gerry adams " the horseman responded when told who the visitor was , " i hear bertie ahern gave him a bit of a roasting the other day " .
and with that he cantered off .
chequers has , it seems , played a bigger part in the northern ireland process than has been previously documented .
asked whether he had visited the country residence before , martin mcguinness replied with a smile " oh yes , many times " .
but this occasion promised to be different from some of the convivial chats sinn fein 's chief negotiator had previously enjoyed with tony blair and jonathan powell .
before heading in , gerry adams said that if the prime minister wanted a row he would give him a row .
however , in the event , according to both sides , there was no angry confrontation .
nevertheless , there are profound disagreements between the two sides .
the government believes the ira robbed the northern bank .
sinn fein is adhering to the ira denial .
gerry adams says he wants to concentrate on the consequences .
but it 's hard to know how two sides who do n't agree where they are can reach agreement on where they are going .
gerry adams said tony blair did not raise the topic of sanctions at chequers .
however , there appear to be growing indications that some action against republicans will be taken .
sanctions the independent monitoring commission could produce an ad hoc report on the northern bank raid fairly soon .
moreover , there seems to be a desire in some political circles for any punishment of sinn fein , whether it is the withdrawal of westminster allowances or not , to be announced before the general election campaign begins in earnest .
although he will vehemently oppose any sanctions , gerry adams appears more concerned about the bigger picture .
he implies that in talks with the british government in late december he was hopeful of advancing his all ireland agenda , perhaps in return for delivering some of the ira concessions then on offer .
this now seems highly unlikely .
the sinn fein president was n't prepared to respond in detail to any of the options that have been floated for a " plan b " such as setting up an assembly without an executive and / or scrutiny committees keeping an eye on direct rule ministers .
he did not threaten to boycott such bodies , but indicated in general terms that he did not believe they were in line with the good friday agreement .
the british and irish governments have spelled out their " stark " messages to sinn fein on paramilitarism and criminality .
but it is hard to see how they can put flesh on the bones of their talk about seeking " another way " forward .

he did not threaten to boycott such bodies , but indicated in general terms that he did not believe they were in line with the good friday agreement .

gerry adams and martin mcguinness met the prime minister at chequers but this occasion promised to be different from some of the convivial chats sinn fein 's chief negotiator had previously enjoyed with tony blair and jonathan powell .

although he will vehemently oppose any sanctions , gerry adams appears more concerned about the bigger picture .
he implies that in talks with the british government in late december he was hopeful of advancing his all ireland agenda , perhaps in return for delivering some of the ira concessions then on offer .
this now seems highly unlikely .
mr adams has not ruled out an assembly without an executive the sinn fein president was n't prepared to respond in detail to any of the options that have been floated for a " plan b " such as setting up an assembly without an executive and / or scrutiny committees keeping an eye on direct rule ministers .
he did not threaten to boycott such bodies , but indicated in general terms that he did not believe they were in line with the good friday agreement .
the british and irish governments have spelled out their " stark " messages to sinn fein on paramilitarism and criminality .
but it is hard to see how they can put flesh on the bones of their talk about seeking " another way " forward .
having got lost for a short time in the chiltern hills en route to chequers i began to form the image in my mind of tony blair and bertie ahern as two motorists whose map reading skills have temporarily deserted them .
they can wind down their windows and ask the locals for directions , but they are liable to be told " if i was you , i would n't start from here " .

the bank of scotland poll found 81 % believed the current tax regime was unfair on new buyers .
seven in 10 thought the threshold for stamp duty , which currently stands at £ 60,000 , should be raised to reflect rising house prices .
the average first-time buyer in scotland currently pays £ 82,654 for a home , compared to £ 40,918 in 1993 .
research carried out by the bank found that uk residential stamp duty tax has gone up more than ninefold in that period , from £ 465m in 1993/4 to an estimated £ 4,300m during the current tax year .
unfair play tim crawford , group economist at bank of scotland , said successive governments , both tory and labour , had " failed to play fair " with homeowners by not linking the stamp duty threshold to house price inflation .
twelve years ago most first-time buyers were below the threshold , whereas now the average buyer is charged £ 826 .
successive governments , irrespective of their political colouring , have failed to play fair by homeowners tim crawford bank of scotland group economist more homeowners are also paying the higher rate , which is charged on properties which change hands for more than £ 250,000 .
stamp duty revenue in scotland is estimated to hit £ 150m in 2003/4 .
the uk government estimates that it would have lost £ 570m if the threshold were raised to £ 150,000 , in line with house price inflation .
' two-way street ' mr crawford said : " housing activity is an important part of the scottish economy , and it is right that a government should take its fair share of tax revenue from it .
" fairness is a two-way street , however , and unfortunately successive governments , irrespective of their political colouring , have failed to play fair by homeowners by declining to index link the stamp duty threshold to house price increases .
" all the main political parties are in favour of helping first-time buyers get onto the housing ladder , so it must be the case that none of them intended that the average first-time buyer should now be paying stamp duty .
" bank of scotland also believes that all the residential stamp duty thresholds should be linked to house price inflation . "
