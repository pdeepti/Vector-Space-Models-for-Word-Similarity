" porsche ag in stuttgart plans to buy about 20 percent of the voting shares in volkswagen ag in wolfsburg , " the company said in a statement .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .

the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .

" the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .

the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed . " deeply eu-skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a referendum in june , almost 55 percent of voters backed joining the schengen area , which eases border controls among 15 countries - 13 eu states plus non-eu countries norway and iceland . but the swiss have been skeptical about eu membership , with a 1980s application to join later put on ice . a motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was rejected by 77 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles try to counter negative image during the french eu constitution vote , much was made of the polish " plumber ” stealing jobs .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .

the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed . " deeply eu-skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a referendum in june , almost 55 percent of voters backed joining the schengen area , which eases border controls among 15 countries - 13 eu states plus non-eu countries norway and iceland . but the swiss have been skeptical about eu membership , with a 1980s application to join later put on ice . a motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was rejected by 77 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles try to counter negative image during the french eu constitution vote , much was made of the polish " plumber ” stealing jobs .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

doctors and caregivers often know too little about the islamic faith and ca n't properly respond to the needs of their patients . karim ötztürk is lying with a femoral neck fracture in the local hospital and having heated debates with the nursing staff .
the topic is the cafeteria 's fare . ötztürk would like to follow the dietary laws of muslim holiday month of ramadan , even while lying in the hospital .
the nurse , overwhelmed by the conflict , calls on the doctor for help . fourteen million muslims live in western europe today , and over three million of them in germany .
some doctors ' offices handle a patient load which is about 30 percent muslim .
that linguistic and cultural confusion results is perhaps not so surprising .
ilhan ilkilic , teaching assistant at the institute for history , theory , and medical ethics at the university of mainz , has been researching typical conflicts between muslim patients and german doctors for many years . he explained that while the linguistic misunderstandings were well known , the deeper , cultural differences were not . " even today , ethical problems in the care of muslim patients are often neglected , " ilkilic said . from pious to irreligious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all muslims are this religious the fact that muslims are not a homogenous group in germany makes dealing with muslim patients more complex .
some are highly devout , while others have assimilated and abandoned their religion . ilkilic described three conflict areas where conflicts between patients of islamic faith , and doctors and nurses occur .
one of the greatest problems is that of communication .
often it is a german-speaking family member who accompanies the patient at the bedside . here the question remains open , if the family member tells the patient the truth .
sometimes the family members want to protect the sick from the truth and therefore purposefully mistranslate the doctor 's statements . hamideh ünal , psychotherapist at the center for victims of torture in cologne , described a situation in which a translator at the bedside became a great difficulty for both doctors and patient . " in such a situation it is nearly hopeless to build up any trust , " she said .
a touchy subject : body contact ilkillic sees a further problem in the crossing of intimate boundaries in medical examinations .
muslims avoid body contact with the opposite sex .
women of faith shield their bodies from the gaze of men . the iranian gynecologist dr. khosravie from bergisch gladbach told of patients who had gotten undressed for the examinations but not removed their head scarf . " traditional muslims do n't even consider my medical practice , " he said khosravie .
for some men , getting a sponge bath from a nurse is worse than the sickness itself .
therefore , the medical care should , when possible , be provided by doctors and nurses of the same sex . the third conflict area , as shown by karim ötztürk 's example , is the dietary restrictions of islam .
most german hospitals today do offer an alternative to pork , however some medications do contain pork products or alcohol . furthermore , islamic fasting laws dictate not only the types of food fit for consumption , but also the times of day that one is permitted to eat .
in the month of ramadan , from dawn until dusk , both fluids and solid foods are taboo . ramadan in the hospital ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at german hospitals , muslim eating habits must be considered the koran explicitly pardons the sick from the fasting rite , but leaves open just when the individual is officially sick .
this is often a difficult decision for the patients .
in such a case the patient could seek the counsel of an imam .
in this way he could be enlightened about not only the medical , but also the religious consequences of his decision .
arif ünal , head of the health center for migrants , would prefer a prayer chapel for muslim patients in german hospitals .
" every christian in germany has the opportunity to retreat to a prayer chapel in the hospital .
why ca n't it be offered to muslim patients as well ? "
ünal believes that doctors must deal with islam more intensively , in order to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts .
at the same time , patients can only be helped when they explain to the doctors their values and needs . a small step which could lead to better understanding between doctors and foreign patients is the translator pool , introduced in berlin two years ago . the project was initiated by the european union , to enable medical and social institutions to hire translators in an emergency .

doctors and caregivers often know too little about the islamic faith and ca n't properly respond to the needs of their patients . karim ötztürk is lying with a femoral neck fracture in the local hospital and having heated debates with the nursing staff .
the topic is the cafeteria 's fare . ötztürk would like to follow the dietary laws of muslim holiday month of ramadan , even while lying in the hospital .
the nurse , overwhelmed by the conflict , calls on the doctor for help . fourteen million muslims live in western europe today , and over three million of them in germany .
some doctors ' offices handle a patient load which is about 30 percent muslim .
that linguistic and cultural confusion results is perhaps not so surprising .
ilhan ilkilic , teaching assistant at the institute for history , theory , and medical ethics at the university of mainz , has been researching typical conflicts between muslim patients and german doctors for many years . he explained that while the linguistic misunderstandings were well known , the deeper , cultural differences were not . " even today , ethical problems in the care of muslim patients are often neglected , " ilkilic said . from pious to irreligious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all muslims are this religious the fact that muslims are not a homogenous group in germany makes dealing with muslim patients more complex .
some are highly devout , while others have assimilated and abandoned their religion . ilkilic described three conflict areas where conflicts between patients of islamic faith , and doctors and nurses occur .
one of the greatest problems is that of communication .
often it is a german-speaking family member who accompanies the patient at the bedside . here the question remains open , if the family member tells the patient the truth .
sometimes the family members want to protect the sick from the truth and therefore purposefully mistranslate the doctor 's statements . hamideh ünal , psychotherapist at the center for victims of torture in cologne , described a situation in which a translator at the bedside became a great difficulty for both doctors and patient . " in such a situation it is nearly hopeless to build up any trust , " she said .
a touchy subject : body contact ilkillic sees a further problem in the crossing of intimate boundaries in medical examinations .
muslims avoid body contact with the opposite sex .
women of faith shield their bodies from the gaze of men . the iranian gynecologist dr. khosravie from bergisch gladbach told of patients who had gotten undressed for the examinations but not removed their head scarf . " traditional muslims do n't even consider my medical practice , " he said khosravie .
for some men , getting a sponge bath from a nurse is worse than the sickness itself .
therefore , the medical care should , when possible , be provided by doctors and nurses of the same sex . the third conflict area , as shown by karim ötztürk 's example , is the dietary restrictions of islam .
most german hospitals today do offer an alternative to pork , however some medications do contain pork products or alcohol . furthermore , islamic fasting laws dictate not only the types of food fit for consumption , but also the times of day that one is permitted to eat .
in the month of ramadan , from dawn until dusk , both fluids and solid foods are taboo . ramadan in the hospital ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at german hospitals , muslim eating habits must be considered the koran explicitly pardons the sick from the fasting rite , but leaves open just when the individual is officially sick .
this is often a difficult decision for the patients .
in such a case the patient could seek the counsel of an imam .
in this way he could be enlightened about not only the medical , but also the religious consequences of his decision .
arif ünal , head of the health center for migrants , would prefer a prayer chapel for muslim patients in german hospitals .
" every christian in germany has the opportunity to retreat to a prayer chapel in the hospital .
why ca n't it be offered to muslim patients as well ? "
ünal believes that doctors must deal with islam more intensively , in order to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts .
at the same time , patients can only be helped when they explain to the doctors their values and needs . a small step which could lead to better understanding between doctors and foreign patients is the translator pool , introduced in berlin two years ago . the project was initiated by the european union , to enable medical and social institutions to hire translators in an emergency .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

" porsche ag in stuttgart plans to buy about 20 percent of the voting shares in volkswagen ag in wolfsburg , " the company said in a statement .
" porsche is taking this decision because volkswagen is now not only an important development partner for porsche , but also a significant supplier for approximately 30 percent of porsche 's sales volume . "
porsche has developed in partnership with vw the 4x4 vehicle cayenne and is also collaborating on a hybrid motor .
" making this investment , we seek to secure our business relations with volkswagen and make a significant contribution to our own future plans on a lasting , long-term basis , " porsche managing director wendelin wiedeking said in the statement . no take-over plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos cabrio the company insisted that it had no plans to acquire volkswagen , the world 's fourth-largest car maker .
" the shares assumed will not under any circumstances reach the threshold at which porsche would be required to submit a public bid for the takeover of volkswagen , " the company said .
porsche 's move is aimed at protecting vw from a potential hostile takeover , made more likely with the anticipated lifting of the so-called volkswagen law , which shields the car maker from hostile takeovers , with a judgment by the european court of justice expected in the spring of 2007 . " our planned investment is the strategic answer to this risk , " wiedeking said in the statement .
" we wish in this way to ensure the independence of the volkswagen group in our own interest .
this ' german solution ' we are seeking is an essential prerequisite for stable development of the volkswagen group and , accordingly , for continuing our cooperation in the interest of both companies . "
vw on cost-cutting spree a report in the german newsweekly der spiegel put the value of the deal at about three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- , citing an unnamed banker involved in the matter .
the announcement came after speculation that us billionaire kirk kerkorian , a las vegas hotel magnate , was looking to buy into vw . facing intense competition and losing market share with an aging model range , vw has been implementing a cost-cutting plan that could see the car-maker shed thousands of jobs . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers optimistic as auto show begins despite runaway gasoline prices , german automakers expressed confidence monday that they have put the worst behind them , pinning their hopes on a flurry of new models being unveiled at the gigantic iaa car show .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .
but the civic platform wants faster reform a 15-percent single tax rate , deregulation , privatization and budget cuts . another germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski on friday urged voters not to be discouraged by the one-sided opinion polls saying the center-right would sweep the board . " we will see on sunday night if opinion polls were right , " he said on public radio one friday , urging poles to vote .
" the situation might look like it did in germany , where the election results differed from pre-election polls . " in germany , the social democrats rose from behind to catch up with the heavily favored conservatives last sunday , creating a deadlock .
many attribute the result to voter fears of more aggressive reform measures . kwasniewski , a former communist , has said he would prefer political power to be divided between the center-right and left , to ensure a balanced parliament with a system of mutual controls . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election cliffhanger triggers surprise in eu europe 's political class appeared stunned monday after elections in germany produced no clear winner in the continent 's biggest economy .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .
but the civic platform wants faster reform a 15-percent single tax rate , deregulation , privatization and budget cuts . another germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski on friday urged voters not to be discouraged by the one-sided opinion polls saying the center-right would sweep the board . " we will see on sunday night if opinion polls were right , " he said on public radio one friday , urging poles to vote .
" the situation might look like it did in germany , where the election results differed from pre-election polls . " in germany , the social democrats rose from behind to catch up with the heavily favored conservatives last sunday , creating a deadlock .
many attribute the result to voter fears of more aggressive reform measures . kwasniewski , a former communist , has said he would prefer political power to be divided between the center-right and left , to ensure a balanced parliament with a system of mutual controls . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election cliffhanger triggers surprise in eu europe 's political class appeared stunned monday after elections in germany produced no clear winner in the continent 's biggest economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2005 swiss back opening labor market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " polish plumber , " it seems , did n't scare the swiss swiss voters sunday backed opening the country 's labour market to workers from the eu 's 10 new member states , with 55.95 percent in favour , according to referendum results from across the country . with the count completed in all of the country 's 26 cantons , or states , the " yes " camp had won in 19 while the " no ' was victorious in just seven , according to regional electoral commissions .
the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed . " deeply eu-skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a referendum in june , almost 55 percent of voters backed joining the schengen area , which eases border controls among 15 countries - 13 eu states plus non-eu countries norway and iceland . but the swiss have been skeptical about eu membership , with a 1980s application to join later put on ice . a motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was rejected by 77 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles try to counter negative image during the french eu constitution vote , much was made of the polish " plumber ” stealing jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2005 schröder sticks to leadership claim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's ruling out paving the way for merkel , for now chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago . schröder said he saw no reason to relinquish his claim to a third term as german leader , despite his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- losing the election by a narrow margin to conservative challenger angela merkel 's christian union alliance -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- in the september 18 poll . " there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .

" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.09.2005 swiss back opening labor market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " polish plumber , " it seems , did n't scare the swiss swiss voters sunday backed opening the country 's labour market to workers from the eu 's 10 new member states , with 55.95 percent in favour , according to referendum results from across the country . with the count completed in all of the country 's 26 cantons , or states , the " yes " camp had won in 19 while the " no ' was victorious in just seven , according to regional electoral commissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2005 schröder sticks to leadership claim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's ruling out paving the way for merkel , for now chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago . schröder said he saw no reason to relinquish his claim to a third term as german leader , despite his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- losing the election by a narrow margin to conservative challenger angela merkel 's christian union alliance -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- in the september 18 poll . " there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.09.2005 schröder sticks to leadership claim großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's ruling out paving the way for merkel , for now chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago . schröder said he saw no reason to relinquish his claim to a third term as german leader , despite his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- losing the election by a narrow margin to conservative challenger angela merkel 's christian union alliance -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- in the september 18 poll . " there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed . " deeply eu-skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a referendum in june , almost 55 percent of voters backed joining the schengen area , which eases border controls among 15 countries - 13 eu states plus non-eu countries norway and iceland . but the swiss have been skeptical about eu membership , with a 1980s application to join later put on ice . a motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was rejected by 77 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles try to counter negative image during the french eu constitution vote , much was made of the polish " plumber ” stealing jobs .

they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed . " deeply eu-skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a referendum in june , almost 55 percent of voters backed joining the schengen area , which eases border controls among 15 countries - 13 eu states plus non-eu countries norway and iceland . but the swiss have been skeptical about eu membership , with a 1980s application to join later put on ice . a motion by pro-eu campaigners in 2001 calling for eu membership talks was rejected by 77 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poles try to counter negative image during the french eu constitution vote , much was made of the polish " plumber ” stealing jobs .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .

" but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .

" porsche ag in stuttgart plans to buy about 20 percent of the voting shares in volkswagen ag in wolfsburg , " the company said in a statement .
" porsche is taking this decision because volkswagen is now not only an important development partner for porsche , but also a significant supplier for approximately 30 percent of porsche 's sales volume . "
porsche has developed in partnership with vw the 4x4 vehicle cayenne and is also collaborating on a hybrid motor .
" making this investment , we seek to secure our business relations with volkswagen and make a significant contribution to our own future plans on a lasting , long-term basis , " porsche managing director wendelin wiedeking said in the statement . no take-over plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos cabrio the company insisted that it had no plans to acquire volkswagen , the world 's fourth-largest car maker .
" the shares assumed will not under any circumstances reach the threshold at which porsche would be required to submit a public bid for the takeover of volkswagen , " the company said .
porsche 's move is aimed at protecting vw from a potential hostile takeover , made more likely with the anticipated lifting of the so-called volkswagen law , which shields the car maker from hostile takeovers , with a judgment by the european court of justice expected in the spring of 2007 . " our planned investment is the strategic answer to this risk , " wiedeking said in the statement .
" we wish in this way to ensure the independence of the volkswagen group in our own interest .
this ' german solution ' we are seeking is an essential prerequisite for stable development of the volkswagen group and , accordingly , for continuing our cooperation in the interest of both companies . "
vw on cost-cutting spree a report in the german newsweekly der spiegel put the value of the deal at about three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- , citing an unnamed banker involved in the matter .
the announcement came after speculation that us billionaire kirk kerkorian , a las vegas hotel magnate , was looking to buy into vw . facing intense competition and losing market share with an aging model range , vw has been implementing a cost-cutting plan that could see the car-maker shed thousands of jobs . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers optimistic as auto show begins despite runaway gasoline prices , german automakers expressed confidence monday that they have put the worst behind them , pinning their hopes on a flurry of new models being unveiled at the gigantic iaa car show .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .
but the civic platform wants faster reform a 15-percent single tax rate , deregulation , privatization and budget cuts . another germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski on friday urged voters not to be discouraged by the one-sided opinion polls saying the center-right would sweep the board . " we will see on sunday night if opinion polls were right , " he said on public radio one friday , urging poles to vote .
" the situation might look like it did in germany , where the election results differed from pre-election polls . " in germany , the social democrats rose from behind to catch up with the heavily favored conservatives last sunday , creating a deadlock .
many attribute the result to voter fears of more aggressive reform measures . kwasniewski , a former communist , has said he would prefer political power to be divided between the center-right and left , to ensure a balanced parliament with a system of mutual controls . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election cliffhanger triggers surprise in eu europe 's political class appeared stunned monday after elections in germany produced no clear winner in the continent 's biggest economy .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .

" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term .

" chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job .

german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir .

" one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .
but the civic platform wants faster reform a 15-percent single tax rate , deregulation , privatization and budget cuts . another germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski on friday urged voters not to be discouraged by the one-sided opinion polls saying the center-right would sweep the board .

" there are no grounds at all to change my position just because some media and the union are putting unseemly pressure -lrb- on me -rrb- , " schröder told ard public television when asked if he still claimed the chancellery . he said the question of who would lead the country would only be resolved in the course of horse-trading to form a ruling coalition . " one will then have to address this question and i am sure it will be resolved at that time , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his conservative challenger angela merkel both laid claims to the chancellery after neither party managed to win a ruling majority in the election last sunday . the inconclusive result has sparked a race to form a stable government , with a " grand coalition " between the social democrats and conservatives appearing increasingly likely .
the two sides met last week for exploratory talks and agreed to do so again . meanwhile , franz müntefering , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , said on sunday his party will wait a week before deciding whether to enter talks on a grand coalition to resolve the political stalemate . müntefering said he would wait until after a by-election in dresden on oct .
2 that was triggered by one candidate 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after the sounding-out meeting , and after the by-election in dresden , it will be decided we can go on to negotiations with the conservatives , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" all the jostling and speculation are not helpful now . " questions hover over leadership claim but that 's precisely what has erupted in germany following what has been one of the most ambiguous election results in the country 's postwar history . over the weekend , conservative leaders , several newspaper columnists and a handful of members of schröder 's own spd raised the pressure on the chancellor by saying that schröder should consider bowing out of the race to break the political deadlock gripping europe 's largest country . the deputy head of the chancellor 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , kurt beck , said he expected a " grand coalition " spanning left and right would eventually take power but that it was unlikely schröder would lead it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in a democracy one should never say never , " beck told the focus news magazine when asked about the prospect of schröder throwing in the towel . " but we will not say from the start that we are ready to make this step , " he added . cdu general secretary volker kauder , said there would be no deal without its leader . " it must be evident that the strongest party determines who will be chancellor , " kauder told german news agency dpa .
" if there is no agreement on this question , coalition negotiations make no sense . " hesse state premier roland koch of the cdu said the spd had to withdraw its claim to the chancellery . " the cdu has the right to name a chancellor , " said koch .
" the spd are not yet ready to accept that .
schröder has made them his emotional hostage . " spd says schröder must go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel believes her party 's lead , however narrow , justifies her bid .
her christian union alliance won 35.2 percent of the vote and 225 seats in the german parliament , finishing less than a point ahead of the social democrats with 34.4 percent and 222 seats . the media-savvy schröder has insisted that he is more capable of forming a stable ruling majority than merkel because of the spd 's surprisingly strong result after months of trailing the conservatives in opinion polls - largely attributed to schröder 's campaign charisma and a smooth performance in a television debate with merkel in early september . but as the euphoria of their come-from-behind score wore off , some social democrats too appeared to acknowledge the game was up . the deputy head of the spd 's parliamentary group , gernot erler , said the party would have to show some flexibility in potential negotiations on forming a government with the christian union alliance . " the union can not enter into coalition talks with the spd saying ' take it or leave it ' .
but neither can the spd , " erler told the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . he noted , however , that only schröder and spd leader franz müntefering had the power to decide what conditions they would set for a grand coalition . " that includes the personnel questions , " he said . meanwhile , members of the green party , junior partners in schröder 's outgoing coalition , began to raise their own doubts about how long the chancellor could cling to his office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens co-leader reinhard bütikofer told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung schröder had no chance of a third term . " the union will provide the chancellor , " he said .
" i think it is impossible that gerhard schröder will be able to enforce his personal claim to power . " chancellor job-sharing ? even as both sides showed no signs of backing down , a key spd deputy johannes kahrs came up with an unprecedented plan to rotate the top job . " schröder must remain chancellor for the first two years , " kahrs told daily die welt .
german television earlier reported that schröder , 61 , favors such a rotation modeled on a 1984-88 israeli government led by shimon peres and then yitzhak shamir . " the solution that both sides rule for two years each has the consensus support of spd parliament deputies , " kahrs added , although there were doubts about whether such an uneasy rotation would conform to the constitution . the conservatives however have rejected the idea . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the disconnect between politics and reality nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .

poles trickled out to vote sunday in the country 's first general elections since joining the eu last year .
opinion polls predict a center-right coalition will sweep the corruption-stained left from power . in overwhelmingly catholic poland , the rush of voting was expected after morning mass .
poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .

the vote was also seen as a key test of ties between the eu and switzerland , which stands steadfastly outside the 25-nation bloc but is ringed by its members and does most of its business with them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at issue was whether to extend an agreement on the free movement of workers to 10 mainly ex-communist countries , such as poland and hungary . it is part of a series of specialized accords , approved by voters in 2000 , between switzerland and the then-15 nation eu .
they smooth trade , labor , educational and technical ties , and are seen by most swiss as a fair compromise between eu membership and the headaches of trying to go it alone . fear of flood of cheap workers the accords were meant to be extended to the countries which joined the eu in may 2004 , but opponents gathered enough signatures to give the 4.8 million voters the final say . nationalists claimed a " yes " would take the country a step closer to eu membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wingers and some on the far left of the " no " camp warned of cheap workers flooding and taking jobs from locals - playing on the fear of the " polish plumber " seen in other west european countries . new opportunities for switzerland ? the " yes " campaigners , who included the government , centrist and mainstream left-wing parties , business groups and trade unions , had dismissed those fears . they cited new economic opportunities for switzerland in fast-growing east european countries , in exchange for the swiss concessions .
they claimed measures such as tough labor inspections will stop companies from ducking swiss wage rules by using east europeans who are ready to work for less . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they also said that a " yes " would show that the swiss are serious about managing ties with the eu through the accords , while a " no , " by undermining them , paradoxically would revive the issue of full membership . there were fears that a " no " could lead the eu to nullify the existing accords with its pre-2004 members , at a time when switzerland is counting on improved ties to help boost its sluggish economy . while west european countries may not want to hit back hard , new eu members would likely have pushed for payback for swiss discrimination , and that could also have caused an internal eu rift . eu concerned about " no " vote " we are hoping very much that the voters of switzerland will approve the decision taken by their government and vote ' yes ' , " said emma udwin , spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita fererro-waldner a day before the vote . she declined to speculate in detail on the consequences of a " no " vote , but said : " there are different repercussions for different areas of our relationship with switzerland .
some are clearer than others , " she said . " in the first instance we would need to see proposals from the swiss government itself on how it would proceed .

poles have until 8:00 pm -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- to cast their ballots . some 30 million poles are eligible to elect 460 members of the sejm lower house and 100 senators for a four-year mandate . key issues at stake are unemployment - 17.8 percent of poland 's workforce is out of a job , the highest percentage in the european union , which the central european country joined last year - and reforms to the economy and administration . leading up to the polls , surveys put the centre-right economically liberal civic platform -lrb- po -rrb- , which is proposing a 15-percent , across-the-board flat tax , or the more conservative catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party in the lead . a poll published in the liberal rzeczpospolita newspaper on friday put the civic platform in the lead with 34 percent , ahead of the conservative , catholic law and justice -lrb- pis -rrb- party , whose agenda includes state aid for the underprivileged and government intervention in the economy , at 29 percent . another poll shows the parties in a dead heat . what is missing however is the left : opinion polls show that many left-wing parties are not even garnering the five percent needed to win a seat in parliament . what should the non-conservative polish voter do , many are asking .
polls predict that many will just stay home . disgust with politics poles are also put off voting by " a general feeling of disgust with politics , " polish academy of sciences sociologist malgorzata melchior told news agency afp .
" politicians have not stopped trading insults , and that discredits the entire political class in the eyes of the voters . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's conservative party leader jaroslaw kaczynski is running for office with his identical twin brother early this week , lena kolarska-bobinska , head of the institute of public affairs , said poles were reluctant to vote because they think " politicians tend to go back on their promises , lie and disregard ordinary voters . " voters are particularly disenchanted with the ruling leftist alliance , the sld , which has slid to the bottom of the polish political mountain . it 's polling around five percent right now ; in the last election four years ago , it took 41 percent . the reason : corruption scandals and inability to reduce unemployment . sld leaders have been convicted for bribery and letting gangsters know about future raids .
public frustration with the sld has grown so strong that even its own members are turning to its conservative arch-enemies , law and justice – who once called the sld a " criminal organization . " the sld has admitted its mistakes .
its leader wojchiech olejniczak said they were now paying the political price . however , other sld politicians have hit back at law and justice , claiming it is trying to polarise polish society to get votes . two partners trading punches but the most vocal punches between parties is that between the two likely coalition partners . in the final days of campaigning before sunday 's vote , pis and po began trading punches , casting doubt on whether their alliance would be able to effectively govern poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister hopeful jan rokita of poland 's pro-business civic platform believes they will win pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who could become prime minister if his party clinches the biggest score on sunday , and whose twin brother lech is the party 's candidate for president in next month 's election , this week accused po of not having a political agenda . po parried the attack , with its prime minister designate jan rokita telling pis to " stop poking fun at our agenda ... and show some seriousness and reliability . " po 's presidential candidate donald tusk joined the fray , accusing pis of following " a dangerous political strategy " by courting the far right , after a pis campaign leader said this week on ultra-conservative catholic radio maryja that tusk 's image was " built on fiction . " " i appeal -lrb- to pis -rrb- to abandon this dangerous political strategy and confirm their will to build a good , wise and responsible government with po , " tusk told afp . " if jaroslaw and lech kaczynski think they 'll be able to build a wealthy and safe poland -lrb- with the far-right -rrb- and , at the same time , cooperate with po , then they 'd better think again .
you ca n't build a safe poland with people whose main driving forces are hatred , obsession and hang-ups . " meanwhile , law and justice has erased the civic platform 's 10 point lead over the last two weeks .
the two future partners both promise lower taxes , more jobs and less corruption .
but the civic platform wants faster reform a 15-percent single tax rate , deregulation , privatization and budget cuts . another germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski outgoing president aleksander kwasniewski on friday urged voters not to be discouraged by the one-sided opinion polls saying the center-right would sweep the board . " we will see on sunday night if opinion polls were right , " he said on public radio one friday , urging poles to vote .
" the situation might look like it did in germany , where the election results differed from pre-election polls . " in germany , the social democrats rose from behind to catch up with the heavily favored conservatives last sunday , creating a deadlock .
many attribute the result to voter fears of more aggressive reform measures . kwasniewski , a former communist , has said he would prefer political power to be divided between the center-right and left , to ensure a balanced parliament with a system of mutual controls . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election cliffhanger triggers surprise in eu europe 's political class appeared stunned monday after elections in germany produced no clear winner in the continent 's biggest economy .

" porsche ag in stuttgart plans to buy about 20 percent of the voting shares in volkswagen ag in wolfsburg , " the company said in a statement .
" porsche is taking this decision because volkswagen is now not only an important development partner for porsche , but also a significant supplier for approximately 30 percent of porsche 's sales volume . "
porsche has developed in partnership with vw the 4x4 vehicle cayenne and is also collaborating on a hybrid motor .

" the shares assumed will not under any circumstances reach the threshold at which porsche would be required to submit a public bid for the takeover of volkswagen , " the company said .
porsche 's move is aimed at protecting vw from a potential hostile takeover , made more likely with the anticipated lifting of the so-called volkswagen law , which shields the car maker from hostile takeovers , with a judgment by the european court of justice expected in the spring of 2007 . " our planned investment is the strategic answer to this risk , " wiedeking said in the statement .
" we wish in this way to ensure the independence of the volkswagen group in our own interest .
this ' german solution ' we are seeking is an essential prerequisite for stable development of the volkswagen group and , accordingly , for continuing our cooperation in the interest of both companies . "
vw on cost-cutting spree a report in the german newsweekly der spiegel put the value of the deal at about three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- , citing an unnamed banker involved in the matter .
the announcement came after speculation that us billionaire kirk kerkorian , a las vegas hotel magnate , was looking to buy into vw . facing intense competition and losing market share with an aging model range , vw has been implementing a cost-cutting plan that could see the car-maker shed thousands of jobs . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers optimistic as auto show begins despite runaway gasoline prices , german automakers expressed confidence monday that they have put the worst behind them , pinning their hopes on a flurry of new models being unveiled at the gigantic iaa car show .

" porsche ag in stuttgart plans to buy about 20 percent of the voting shares in volkswagen ag in wolfsburg , " the company said in a statement .

it is too easy for mps and ministers to think that the " system 's all right - it elected me , " she explains .
when a ministerial car is waiting outside your door , democracy must seem to be in pretty good shape , she argues .
it is a frank admission from the minister with one of the most difficult briefs in westminster - to reverse what sometimes seems like the perennial british disease of voter apathy and alienation .
ms harman is a political survivor .
she was a member of tony blair 's first cabinet and remains a keeper of the new labour flame .
as elections minister , she has taken on a higher profile than in recent years .
a bill and campaign to encourage more people to put their names on the electoral register are in the pipeline later this year .
and on sunday she addressed labour 's annual conference in brighton on her plans to close the electoral deficit and boost voter registration .
social justice the problem - identified by ms harman - is that the country has " democracy deserts " , areas , often in labour 's inner city heartlands , where few people register to vote or , if registered , bother to turn out on polling day . "
how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ? "
harriet harman on the attitude of some ministers " there are some areas where hardly anybody votes , which are the most poor and deprived areas , " she says .
" black people are less likely to vote than white and homeowners are more likely to go to the polls than their council tenant neighbours , " she says .
one in five londoners who are eligible to vote , do not do so , she says .
" the most basic reason is that people have got to be entitled to vote - they have got to be on the electoral register . "
it is more than just a dry administrative issue .
ms harman knows that the campaigns for social justice and equality so close to the heart of labour activists also depend on increased engagement with the democratic process .
about 3.5m people entitled to vote can not because they are not registered .
a lack of understanding about the registration process , including the fact a form has to be returned every year to give a person the right to vote , is part of the problem , she says .
complex forms " some people think that you become entitled to vote just by becoming 18 and that it 's automatic .
" others think that if they have been on the register and have voted once , that 's it .
" they say , ' well how come the council says i 'm not on the electoral register - they sent me a council tax bill yesterday , so they know i 'm there ' .
" also the forms vary from borough to borough - some are very clear and very straight-forward , some are byzantine in their complexity .
" what we do n't want to have is a situation where we get a divide between those who do vote and those who do n't .
" the problem with that is not just that those individuals do n't have their right to vote and are not participating in our democracy on equal terms , but it is less likely that public policy will look towards their needs and concerns . "
london campaign a bill to help make registration simpler and clearer is being introduced later this year .
ms harman will also press the issue at labour 's conference , and with london mayor ken livingstone , council leaders , community groups and schools during a big publicity campaign in the capital ahead of next may 's local elections .
but she says mps - and ministers - also have their part to play in actually getting people to want to be registered and vote . "
we ca n't just say voters have got to be told it matters - that is not good enough " harriet harman it would not hurt for a letter to go out to all those on the electoral register after a vote to give them the result of the election , she says .
" we expect people to automatically want to be on the register and to automatically want to vote even though we do n't even tell them who has been elected .
" they might not even know who has been elected until it comes round to the next election - there are a whole range of things we need to address .
" the focus of the labour party has always been to get ourselves elected , but we have to do more than that .
" we have got to make sure that democracy is healthy because we care about equality and social justice . "
sense of security ?
while she declined to go into the contents of the bill ahead of its publication , ms harman says ideas being touted to address the issue include : reducing the voting age , citizenship classes in schools , compulsory voting and greater involvement in the process between elections .
she says she accepts that some people who feel disillusioned with politics , " do not like politicians and believe we are all in it for ourselves " .
but it is also too easy for mps to be " lulled into a sense that the system is all right , it elected me " , she says .
this could be applied to ministers as well .
" how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ?
things must be working pretty well .

one in five londoners who are eligible to vote , fail to do so it is too easy for mps and ministers to think that the " system 's all right - it elected me , " she explains .
when a ministerial car is waiting outside your door , democracy must seem to be in pretty good shape , she argues .
it is a frank admission from the minister with one of the most difficult briefs in westminster - to reverse what sometimes seems like the perennial british disease of voter apathy and alienation .
ms harman is a political survivor .
she was a member of tony blair 's first cabinet and remains a keeper of the new labour flame .
as elections minister , she has taken on a higher profile than in recent years .
a bill and campaign to encourage more people to put their names on the electoral register are in the pipeline later this year .
and on sunday she addressed labour 's annual conference in brighton on her plans to close the electoral deficit and boost voter registration .
social justice the problem - identified by ms harman - is that the country has " democracy deserts " , areas , often in labour 's inner city heartlands , where few people register to vote or , if registered , bother to turn out on polling day .
how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ?
harriet harman on the attitude of some ministers " there are some areas where hardly anybody votes , which are the most poor and deprived areas , " she says .
" black people are less likely to vote than white and homeowners are more likely to go to the polls than their council tenant neighbours , " she says .
one in five londoners who are eligible to vote , do not do so , she says .
" the most basic reason is that people have got to be entitled to vote - they have got to be on the electoral register . "
it is more than just a dry administrative issue .
ms harman knows that the campaigns for social justice and equality so close to the heart of labour activists also depend on increased engagement with the democratic process .
about 3.5m people entitled to vote can not because they are not registered .
a lack of understanding about the registration process , including the fact a form has to be returned every year to give a person the right to vote , is part of the problem , she says .
complex forms " some people think that you become entitled to vote just by becoming 18 and that it 's automatic .
" others think that if they have been on the register and have voted once , that 's it .
harman : compulsory voting is one idea being considered " they say , ' well how come the council says i 'm not on the electoral register - they sent me a council tax bill yesterday , so they know i 'm there ' .
" also the forms vary from borough to borough - some are very clear and very straight-forward , some are byzantine in their complexity .
" what we do n't want to have is a situation where we get a divide between those who do vote and those who do n't .
" the problem with that is not just that those individuals do n't have their right to vote and are not participating in our democracy on equal terms , but it is less likely that public policy will look towards their needs and concerns . "
london campaign a bill to help make registration simpler and clearer is being introduced later this year .
ms harman will also press the issue at labour 's conference , and with london mayor ken livingstone , council leaders , community groups and schools during a big publicity campaign in the capital ahead of next may 's local elections .
but she says mps - and ministers - also have their part to play in actually getting people to want to be registered and vote .
we ca n't just say voters have got to be told it matters - that is not good enough harriet harman it would not hurt for a letter to go out to all those on the electoral register after a vote to give them the result of the election , she says .
" we expect people to automatically want to be on the register and to automatically want to vote even though we do n't even tell them who has been elected .
" they might not even know who has been elected until it comes round to the next election - there are a whole range of things we need to address .
" the focus of the labour party has always been to get ourselves elected , but we have to do more than that .
" we have got to make sure that democracy is healthy because we care about equality and social justice . "
sense of security ?
while she declined to go into the contents of the bill ahead of its publication , ms harman says ideas being touted to address the issue include : reducing the voting age , citizenship classes in schools , compulsory voting and greater involvement in the process between elections .
she says she accepts that some people who feel disillusioned with politics , " do not like politicians and believe we are all in it for ourselves " .
but it is also too easy for mps to be " lulled into a sense that the system is all right , it elected me " , she says .
this could be applied to ministers as well .
" how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ?
things must be working pretty well .
" we have got to look at the problem .
we ca n't just say voters have got to be told it matters - that is not good enough , " she added .

one in five londoners who are eligible to vote , fail to do so it is too easy for mps and ministers to think that the " system 's all right - it elected me , " she explains .
when a ministerial car is waiting outside your door , democracy must seem to be in pretty good shape , she argues .
it is a frank admission from the minister with one of the most difficult briefs in westminster - to reverse what sometimes seems like the perennial british disease of voter apathy and alienation .
ms harman is a political survivor .
she was a member of tony blair 's first cabinet and remains a keeper of the new labour flame .
as elections minister , she has taken on a higher profile than in recent years .
a bill and campaign to encourage more people to put their names on the electoral register are in the pipeline later this year .
and on sunday she addressed labour 's annual conference in brighton on her plans to close the electoral deficit and boost voter registration .
social justice the problem - identified by ms harman - is that the country has " democracy deserts " , areas , often in labour 's inner city heartlands , where few people register to vote or , if registered , bother to turn out on polling day .
how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ?
harriet harman on the attitude of some ministers " there are some areas where hardly anybody votes , which are the most poor and deprived areas , " she says .
" black people are less likely to vote than white and homeowners are more likely to go to the polls than their council tenant neighbours , " she says .
one in five londoners who are eligible to vote , do not do so , she says .
" the most basic reason is that people have got to be entitled to vote - they have got to be on the electoral register . "
it is more than just a dry administrative issue .
ms harman knows that the campaigns for social justice and equality so close to the heart of labour activists also depend on increased engagement with the democratic process .
about 3.5m people entitled to vote can not because they are not registered .
a lack of understanding about the registration process , including the fact a form has to be returned every year to give a person the right to vote , is part of the problem , she says .
complex forms " some people think that you become entitled to vote just by becoming 18 and that it 's automatic .
" others think that if they have been on the register and have voted once , that 's it .
harman : compulsory voting is one idea being considered " they say , ' well how come the council says i 'm not on the electoral register - they sent me a council tax bill yesterday , so they know i 'm there ' .
" also the forms vary from borough to borough - some are very clear and very straight-forward , some are byzantine in their complexity .
" what we do n't want to have is a situation where we get a divide between those who do vote and those who do n't .
" the problem with that is not just that those individuals do n't have their right to vote and are not participating in our democracy on equal terms , but it is less likely that public policy will look towards their needs and concerns . "
london campaign a bill to help make registration simpler and clearer is being introduced later this year .
ms harman will also press the issue at labour 's conference , and with london mayor ken livingstone , council leaders , community groups and schools during a big publicity campaign in the capital ahead of next may 's local elections .
but she says mps - and ministers - also have their part to play in actually getting people to want to be registered and vote .
we ca n't just say voters have got to be told it matters - that is not good enough harriet harman it would not hurt for a letter to go out to all those on the electoral register after a vote to give them the result of the election , she says .
" we expect people to automatically want to be on the register and to automatically want to vote even though we do n't even tell them who has been elected .
" they might not even know who has been elected until it comes round to the next election - there are a whole range of things we need to address .
" the focus of the labour party has always been to get ourselves elected , but we have to do more than that .
" we have got to make sure that democracy is healthy because we care about equality and social justice . "
sense of security ?
while she declined to go into the contents of the bill ahead of its publication , ms harman says ideas being touted to address the issue include : reducing the voting age , citizenship classes in schools , compulsory voting and greater involvement in the process between elections .
she says she accepts that some people who feel disillusioned with politics , " do not like politicians and believe we are all in it for ourselves " .
but it is also too easy for mps to be " lulled into a sense that the system is all right , it elected me " , she says .
this could be applied to ministers as well .
" how bad can the system be if a ministerial car is outside your front door ?
things must be working pretty well .
" we have got to look at the problem .
we ca n't just say voters have got to be told it matters - that is not good enough , " she added .

jon cruddas said this was not a criticism of his former boss , but the product of the electoral system .

he said this was to the detriment of working class people in his community .

" the debate is whether that is good for democracy or whether it disenfranchises huge swathes of the country , including working class communities in my constituency , " he said .

that is one of the conclusions of a southampton university project scoping out the feasibility of microgrids for power generation and distribution .
microgrids are small community networks that supply electricity and heat .
they could make substantial savings , and emissions cuts with no major changes to lifestyles , researchers say .
electricity suppliers are aiming to meet the uk government 's renewables obligation , requiring them to generate 15 % of electricity from renewable sources by 2015 .
microgrids , say the researchers , could easily integrate alternative energy production , such as wind or solar , into the electricity network .
they could also make substantial savings and cuts to emissions without major changes to lifestyles , according to lead researcher , dr tom markvart .
we wanted to look at what kind of energy system we would ideally construct today , in the 21st century , in response to current pressures for higher energy use dr tom markvart , southampton university " this would save something like 20 to 30 % of our emissions with hardly anyone knowing it , " he told the bbc news website .
" a microgrid is a collection of small generators for a collection of users in close proximity , " explained dr markvart , whose research appears in the royal academy of engineering 's ingenia magazine .
" it supplies heat through the household , but you already have cables in the ground , so it is easy to construct an electricity network .
then you create some sort of control network . "
that network could be made into a smart grid using more sophisticated software and grid computing technologies .
as an analogy , the microgrids could work like peer-to-peer file-sharing technologies , such as bittorrents , where demand is split up and shared around the network of " users " .
microgrids could exist as stand alone power networks within small communities , or be owned and operated by existing power suppliers .
campaign groups such as the green alliance have been pushing for micropower generation technologies , such as micro-chp -lrb- combined heat and power -rrb- boilers - a vital part of microgrids - mini-wind turbines and photovoltaic -lrb- pv -rrb- solar arrays .
micro-chp units generate electricity but then make sure the surplus heat that would normally escape through flues is put to good use , such as heating a house or group of buildings .
and by generating electricity locally , the units avoid the transmission inefficiencies that inevitably come with power that is produced at great distance .
homeowners with these units can also sell any surplus electricity back to the national grid .
the green alliance says the government should take micro-generation more seriously .
putting just six panels of solar pvs on a typical new three-bedroom house would reduce that household 's carbon emissions by over 20 % , according to the group .
power pressures microgrids are designed for a smallish community - a typical uk housing estate for example .
they deal much more efficiently with fluctuating power demands which the national grid is not flexible enough to cope with .
dr markvart 's project was initiated in recognition that the uk 's current electricity distribution system was built around the availability of fossil fuels .
solar arrays could integrate into the electricity network via microgrids but the 21st century throws up some pressing questions about the use of fossil fuels .
" we wanted to look at what kind of energy system we would ideally construct today , in the 21st century , in response to current pressures for higher energy use , " dr markvart said .
" we looked at something to which the technology energy sector could evolve in response to the need to reduce emissions . "
dr markvart and his team at southampton university built a computer model to test out the viability of such small scale networks , combining micro-chp units with pv solar arrays to convert sunlight into electricity .
" it is a little bit like comparing the old style telephone network with the network today , " said dr markvart .
installing a microgrid would not need an entirely new network to be built , as some broadband networks have dictated .
for developing countries , buildings could provide electricity without the need for vast infrastructures to be put in place .
close to home as the cost of alternative technologies falls and their efficiencies rise , they become much more of a viable option .
greenhouse gas emissions could also be reduced if micro generators were powered by hydrogen , sunlight or small wind turbines , said dr markvart .
having generators close to demand also cuts down the cost of getting power from a remote power station to the household .
generator sizes are similar to loads - which is very different to traditional systems with huge power stations serving lots of small users .
smaller networks mean ways to store unused power can be introduced , something that does not happen in large networks .
" in a traditional system , you have the power station and electricity flows from power station to users - it is unidirectional .
the whole network is constructed around that unidirectional power flow .
" there is also a tremendous amount of heat generated during the process .
the heat is just waste and it is disposed of , " explained dr markvart .
the huge " chimneys " that have become a familiar part of many areas of the uk are the towers that cool down and then expel the heat waste .
" only about 30 to 40 % of the primary energy ends up as electricity ; 60 to 70 % goes up the chimney .
you do n't have any use for it because there is no one located around the station that needs heat . "
increasingly , micro-chp units are being tested out in small communities to potentially replace conventional central-heating boiler units .
according to estimates , eight million micro-chp units could be in homes by 2020 , supplying a third of a household 's power .
but renewable power groups have called for clearer government policy targets for alternative power strategies .
" we could have microgrids tomorrow ; it can be done now .
the technology is there , " said dr markvart .
the main barriers however , are institutional and regulatory .
there are some moves afoot by regulators ofgem , which is working on a registered power zones concept to convince the electricity companies of their potential .
the cost of renewable energy devices has been recognised by the government , according to the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- .
it wants to excite the industry so that the cost of individual units falls .

we wanted to look at what kind of energy system we would ideally construct today , in the 21st century , in response to current pressures for higher energy use dr tom markvart , southampton university " this would save something like 20 to 30 % of our emissions with hardly anyone knowing it , " he told the bbc news website .
" a microgrid is a collection of small generators for a collection of users in close proximity , " explained dr markvart , whose research appears in the royal academy of engineering 's ingenia magazine .
" it supplies heat through the household , but you already have cables in the ground , so it is easy to construct an electricity network .
then you create some sort of control network . "
that network could be made into a smart grid using more sophisticated software and grid computing technologies .
as an analogy , the microgrids could work like peer-to-peer file-sharing technologies , such as bittorrents , where demand is split up and shared around the network of " users " .
microgrids could exist as stand alone power networks within small communities , or be owned and operated by existing power suppliers .
campaign groups such as the green alliance have been pushing for micropower generation technologies , such as micro-chp -lrb- combined heat and power -rrb- boilers - a vital part of microgrids - mini-wind turbines and photovoltaic -lrb- pv -rrb- solar arrays .
micro-chp units generate electricity but then make sure the surplus heat that would normally escape through flues is put to good use , such as heating a house or group of buildings .
and by generating electricity locally , the units avoid the transmission inefficiencies that inevitably come with power that is produced at great distance .
homeowners with these units can also sell any surplus electricity back to the national grid .
the green alliance says the government should take micro-generation more seriously .
putting just six panels of solar pvs on a typical new three-bedroom house would reduce that household 's carbon emissions by over 20 % , according to the group .
power pressures microgrids are designed for a smallish community - a typical uk housing estate for example .
they deal much more efficiently with fluctuating power demands which the national grid is not flexible enough to cope with .
dr markvart 's project was initiated in recognition that the uk 's current electricity distribution system was built around the availability of fossil fuels .
solar arrays could integrate into the electricity network via microgrids but the 21st century throws up some pressing questions about the use of fossil fuels .
" we wanted to look at what kind of energy system we would ideally construct today , in the 21st century , in response to current pressures for higher energy use , " dr markvart said .
" we looked at something to which the technology energy sector could evolve in response to the need to reduce emissions . "
dr markvart and his team at southampton university built a computer model to test out the viability of such small scale networks , combining micro-chp units with pv solar arrays to convert sunlight into electricity .
" it is a little bit like comparing the old style telephone network with the network today , " said dr markvart .
installing a microgrid would not need an entirely new network to be built , as some broadband networks have dictated .
for developing countries , buildings could provide electricity without the need for vast infrastructures to be put in place .
close to home as the cost of alternative technologies falls and their efficiencies rise , they become much more of a viable option .
greenhouse gas emissions could also be reduced if micro generators were powered by hydrogen , sunlight or small wind turbines , said dr markvart .
having generators close to demand also cuts down the cost of getting power from a remote power station to the household .
generator sizes are similar to loads - which is very different to traditional systems with huge power stations serving lots of small users .
smaller networks mean ways to store unused power can be introduced , something that does not happen in large networks .
" in a traditional system , you have the power station and electricity flows from power station to users - it is unidirectional .
the whole network is constructed around that unidirectional power flow .
" there is also a tremendous amount of heat generated during the process .
the heat is just waste and it is disposed of , " explained dr markvart .
the huge " chimneys " that have become a familiar part of many areas of the uk are the towers that cool down and then expel the heat waste .
" only about 30 to 40 % of the primary energy ends up as electricity ; 60 to 70 % goes up the chimney .
you do n't have any use for it because there is no one located around the station that needs heat . "
increasingly , micro-chp units are being tested out in small communities to potentially replace conventional central-heating boiler units .
according to estimates , eight million micro-chp units could be in homes by 2020 , supplying a third of a household 's power .
but renewable power groups have called for clearer government policy targets for alternative power strategies .
" we could have microgrids tomorrow ; it can be done now .
the technology is there , " said dr markvart .
the main barriers however , are institutional and regulatory .
there are some moves afoot by regulators ofgem , which is working on a registered power zones concept to convince the electricity companies of their potential .
the cost of renewable energy devices has been recognised by the government , according to the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- .
it wants to excite the industry so that the cost of individual units falls .

that is one of the conclusions of a southampton university project scoping out the feasibility of microgrids for power generation and distribution .
microgrids are small community networks that supply electricity and heat .
they could make substantial savings , and emissions cuts with no major changes to lifestyles , researchers say .
electricity suppliers are aiming to meet the uk government 's renewables obligation , requiring them to generate 15 % of electricity from renewable sources by 2015 .
