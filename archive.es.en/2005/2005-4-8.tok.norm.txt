but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .

hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .

" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .
last year , abdelghani mzoudi , an accomplice to the planners of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks was bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's trial is still going on in hamburg acquitted by a hamburg court and mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , the only person worldwide convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks , won retrial because the court did n't hear crucial testimony . the acquittals have frustrated german government leaders eager to show that they are winning the fight against terrorism .
there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .
" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .
not to worry , said one italian paper : " he has already performed a first miracle - all these people here for him . "
an icon of the sick because of his own illnesses , john paul ii was sure to be invoked often in the prayers of the ill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican teen , heron badillo , said this week that the late pope cured his leukemia after dozens of doctors had abandoned hope that he could be healed . " since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .
few would say that john paul ii had not . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc illegals with german visas said in portugal ten thousand illegal immigrants who entered germany on tourist visas went on to work on the building sites of stadiums for the euro 2004 football championships , the german opposition claimed on thursday .
eckart von klaeden , a leading member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that a policy of relaxing the criteria for issuing german visas has led to around 100,000 immigrants coming to germany between 2000 and 2003 .
it is alleged that the relaxed rules were abused by ' human traffickers ' who brought eastern europeans , especially ukrainians , into germany on tourist visas when in fact most were intending to work in the country or elsewhere in western europe .
" the visa policy and criminal activity went hand in hand , " von klaeden told a meeting of foreign journalists in the german capital .
he said documents seen by the committee investigating the scandal had revealed that many immigrants found their way to portugal where stadiums were being constructed or renovated for last year 's european football championships .
he also alleged that germany 's embassy in china had issued a large number of visas in december 2004 , which he said confirmed that the policy was still being carried out despite the government 's insistence that it closed the loophole in 2003 .
beleaguered german foreign minister joschka fischer will have a chance to explain his role in the scandal when he appears before a parliamentary investigation on april 25 .
fischer 's evidence will come less than a month before a key state election on may 22 in germany 's most heavily populated state of north rhine-westphalia .
he is a leading member of the greens , the junior partners of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the ruling coalition .
after a string of setbacks in state elections , defeat for the spd in one of its traditional strongholds would leave the government in tatters with a general election looming in september 2006 .

" i am looking forward to our meeting in hanover which will undoubtedly lead to the further development of the russian-german partnership , " putin told schröder by telephone this week .
putin and schröder will open the hanover fair , one of the biggest trade fairs in the world which this year includes representatives from 6,090 companies from 65 countries with russia as the guest of honor .
alkhanov will use the trip to meet representatives of german humanitarian organizations about what they can do towards rebuilding war-shattered chechnya within the framework of eu reconstruction efforts .
the idea of involving the german humanitarian organizations was raised during putin 's visit to germany in december .
the european union 's executive commission announced on thursday it was giving 22.5 million euros -lrb- $ 29.1 million -rrb- in aid to victims of the conflict in chechnya where separatists and islamic militants have been fighting pro-russian forces in chechnya for more than five years .
the funds , the first to be made available this year , come on top of 148 million euros already handed out by brussels ' humanitarian aid agency echo since the beginning of the conflict in 1999 . schröder maintains a close friendship with putin , and recently underlined the importance of ensuring russia is involved in europe 's planning .
" without a genuine strategic partnership with russia , there will not be peace and sustainable economic development for us europeans , " the chancellor said .
putin will conclude his visit on monday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings .

" millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .
next to benedict xv lies the late pope 's immediate predecessor john paul i , who died after a brief 33-day papacy in 1978 . afp / dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland mourns national hero while thousands of pilgrims flock to rome , polish mourners descend on john paul ii 's hometown of wadowice and krakow to honor the passing of a native son and a national hero .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .

" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .

waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .

" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .
" it will have a negative impact not just on sino-european textile trade , but on overall global textile trade . " end of quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sales assistants in a fabric shop display their merchandise in beijing .

the expiry of the system has left producers in developed and developing countries bracing for a wave of imports from china , whose manufacturers benefit from cheap labor and huge economies of scale . reacting to the groundswell for protectionist measures in the west against its textile exports , china insists that it should not be penalized for having more competitive industries .
" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .
the national textile association -lrb- nta -rrb- said urgent measures were needed in addition to the us government 's announcement this week that it has launched an investigation as a first step to slapping restrictions on the chinese exports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard stands near clothing on sale at discount prices , at an outdoor market in china .

euratex was reluctant to comment on the eu measures before being able to study them in depth , but an official said that " we 've been waiting since the end of the year -lrb- 2004 -rrb- for the guidelines as they have been published .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.04.2005 pope laid to rest after emotional mass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mourned by millions the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history . an estimated one million mourners crammed into and around st peter 's square on friday for a funeral mass expressing " joyful hope and profound gratitude " for the life of pope john paul ii . the pope " sees and blesses us , " the officiating priest , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , said to loud applause at the end of his homily , delivered over the plain cypress wood coffin on the windswept esplanade outside st peter 's basilica . he spoke after the start of an almost three-hour requiem mass , one of the largest in history , broadcast live to hundreds of millions of television viewers around the world . ratzinger said that john paul ii , who died on saturday aged 84 after years of debilitating illness , had borne " a burden which transcends merely human abilities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .
next to benedict xv lies the late pope 's immediate predecessor john paul i , who died after a brief 33-day papacy in 1978 . afp / dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland mourns national hero while thousands of pilgrims flock to rome , polish mourners descend on john paul ii 's hometown of wadowice and krakow to honor the passing of a native son and a national hero .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .
next to benedict xv lies the late pope 's immediate predecessor john paul i , who died after a brief 33-day papacy in 1978 . afp / dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland mourns national hero while thousands of pilgrims flock to rome , polish mourners descend on john paul ii 's hometown of wadowice and krakow to honor the passing of a native son and a national hero .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

eckart von klaeden , a leading member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that a policy of relaxing the criteria for issuing german visas has led to around 100,000 immigrants coming to germany between 2000 and 2003 .
it is alleged that the relaxed rules were abused by ' human traffickers ' who brought eastern europeans , especially ukrainians , into germany on tourist visas when in fact most were intending to work in the country or elsewhere in western europe .
" the visa policy and criminal activity went hand in hand , " von klaeden told a meeting of foreign journalists in the german capital .
he said documents seen by the committee investigating the scandal had revealed that many immigrants found their way to portugal where stadiums were being constructed or renovated for last year 's european football championships .
he also alleged that germany 's embassy in china had issued a large number of visas in december 2004 , which he said confirmed that the policy was still being carried out despite the government 's insistence that it closed the loophole in 2003 .
beleaguered german foreign minister joschka fischer will have a chance to explain his role in the scandal when he appears before a parliamentary investigation on april 25 .
fischer 's evidence will come less than a month before a key state election on may 22 in germany 's most heavily populated state of north rhine-westphalia .
he is a leading member of the greens , the junior partners of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in the ruling coalition .
after a string of setbacks in state elections , defeat for the spd in one of its traditional strongholds would leave the government in tatters with a general election looming in september 2006 .

eckart von klaeden , a leading member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that a policy of relaxing the criteria for issuing german visas has led to around 100,000 immigrants coming to germany between 2000 and 2003 .
it is alleged that the relaxed rules were abused by ' human traffickers ' who brought eastern europeans , especially ukrainians , into germany on tourist visas when in fact most were intending to work in the country or elsewhere in western europe .
" the visa policy and criminal activity went hand in hand , " von klaeden told a meeting of foreign journalists in the german capital .
he said documents seen by the committee investigating the scandal had revealed that many immigrants found their way to portugal where stadiums were being constructed or renovated for last year 's european football championships .
he also alleged that germany 's embassy in china had issued a large number of visas in december 2004 , which he said confirmed that the policy was still being carried out despite the government 's insistence that it closed the loophole in 2003 .
beleaguered german foreign minister joschka fischer will have a chance to explain his role in the scandal when he appears before a parliamentary investigation on april 25 .
fischer 's evidence will come less than a month before a key state election on may 22 in germany 's most heavily populated state of north rhine-westphalia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2005 china angered by eu textile import plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson still wants to be friends china has reacted furiously to new measures taken by the european union against imports of chinese textiles , calling the move a potential blow to the global clothing trade . the european union had on wednesday sought to soothe member states and industry concerns about surging chinese textile imports , while being careful not to upset beijing on the issues . eu trade commissioner peter mandelson unveiled " alert levels " to consider limiting chinese clothing imports but did not bow to pressure from the european textile industry to take more drastic action to hold back chinese textiles . the thresholds on such imports into europe could trigger an investigation to determine if so-called " safeguards " are needed .
however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .
" it will have a negative impact not just on sino-european textile trade , but on overall global textile trade . " end of quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sales assistants in a fabric shop display their merchandise in beijing .
the eu and us actions reflect a world coming to terms with the end on jan .
1 of a 31-year-old international textile import quota system .
the expiry of the system has left producers in developed and developing countries bracing for a wave of imports from china , whose manufacturers benefit from cheap labor and huge economies of scale . reacting to the groundswell for protectionist measures in the west against its textile exports , china insists that it should not be penalized for having more competitive industries .
" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .
the national textile association -lrb- nta -rrb- said urgent measures were needed in addition to the us government 's announcement this week that it has launched an investigation as a first step to slapping restrictions on the chinese exports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard stands near clothing on sale at discount prices , at an outdoor market in china .
the nta filed petitions with the government demanding the restoration of textile quotas that were scrapped globally on jan .
1 , claiming that textile and apparel imports from china had leapt by 63 percent since then . the european textile association euratex is lobbying hard to get brussels to start investigating if safeguards are needed .
euratex was reluctant to comment on the eu measures before being able to study them in depth , but an official said that " we 've been waiting since the end of the year -lrb- 2004 -rrb- for the guidelines as they have been published . " but british non-governmental organisation oxfam hit out at the eu measures , which it said threatened china 's reduction of poverty .
" european industry had more than a decade to prepare for the end of quotas .
they decided not to .
china should not be penalized because europe maintained most of the quotas until the last minute instead of having a managed phase-out , " said oxfam fair-trade campaigner phil bloomer . under the terms of china 's accession to the world trade organisation , its trade partners can take action to limit chinese textile imports during a transition period running until 2008 if they can prove that the imports are disrupting the market . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune .

teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .

john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings .

" millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .

teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .

john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .

" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .
" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .
not to worry , said one italian paper : " he has already performed a first miracle - all these people here for him . "
an icon of the sick because of his own illnesses , john paul ii was sure to be invoked often in the prayers of the ill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican teen , heron badillo , said this week that the late pope cured his leukemia after dozens of doctors had abandoned hope that he could be healed . " since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .
few would say that john paul ii had not . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .

such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

a big , metal apparatus , with flashing lights and whirring cylinders , wires spilling out , filling up the room .
and there are , in fact , computers kind of like that in the world .
but there are other kinds of supercomputers .
they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .
but they are powerful .
quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .
it ’ s as if all the people in your town memorised a few lines of hamlet .
put everyone together in the town square , and soon , out of almost nothing , to be or not to be .
the eu is a kind of network : many separate countries , co-ordinating on a bigger project called europe .
maybe that ’ s why now ’ s a great time to build a supercomputer network on the continent .
the project is called deisa , and now dr hermann lederer of the garching computing centre of the max planck society is going to take us on a quick tour of a very fast network .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .
" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .
not to worry , said one italian paper : " he has already performed a first miracle - all these people here for him . "
an icon of the sick because of his own illnesses , john paul ii was sure to be invoked often in the prayers of the ill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican teen , heron badillo , said this week that the late pope cured his leukemia after dozens of doctors had abandoned hope that he could be healed . " since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .
few would say that john paul ii had not . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .

proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .

" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "

" since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .

a big , metal apparatus , with flashing lights and whirring cylinders , wires spilling out , filling up the room .
and there are , in fact , computers kind of like that in the world .
but there are other kinds of supercomputers .
they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .
but they are powerful .
quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .
it ’ s as if all the people in your town memorised a few lines of hamlet .
put everyone together in the town square , and soon , out of almost nothing , to be or not to be .
the eu is a kind of network : many separate countries , co-ordinating on a bigger project called europe .
maybe that ’ s why now ’ s a great time to build a supercomputer network on the continent .
the project is called deisa , and now dr hermann lederer of the garching computing centre of the max planck society is going to take us on a quick tour of a very fast network .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .

the expiry of the system has left producers in developed and developing countries bracing for a wave of imports from china , whose manufacturers benefit from cheap labor and huge economies of scale . reacting to the groundswell for protectionist measures in the west against its textile exports , china insists that it should not be penalized for having more competitive industries .
" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .

such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .

" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .
following the realization that the sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks were planned in hamburg , the government passed two security packages that eased the burden on prosecutors .
hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .

" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .
" it will have a negative impact not just on sino-european textile trade , but on overall global textile trade . " end of quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sales assistants in a fabric shop display their merchandise in beijing .
the eu and us actions reflect a world coming to terms with the end on jan .
1 of a 31-year-old international textile import quota system .
the expiry of the system has left producers in developed and developing countries bracing for a wave of imports from china , whose manufacturers benefit from cheap labor and huge economies of scale . reacting to the groundswell for protectionist measures in the west against its textile exports , china insists that it should not be penalized for having more competitive industries .
" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .
the overall trade relationship between china and the eu should n't be impacted by unilateral moves , " he said . according to the measures unveiled by the european union wednesday , the " alert levels " range from 10 to 100 percent growth over the 2004 trade volume , depending on the type of product . " you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .
" following the end of the quotas , there is no legal basis for adopting this kind of even broader restrictive measure , " he said . us industry demands action the us garment industry wednesday demanded government action to curb 14 types of apparel exported from china as tensions over surging chinese textile shipments escalated .
the national textile association -lrb- nta -rrb- said urgent measures were needed in addition to the us government 's announcement this week that it has launched an investigation as a first step to slapping restrictions on the chinese exports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard stands near clothing on sale at discount prices , at an outdoor market in china .
the nta filed petitions with the government demanding the restoration of textile quotas that were scrapped globally on jan .
1 , claiming that textile and apparel imports from china had leapt by 63 percent since then . the european textile association euratex is lobbying hard to get brussels to start investigating if safeguards are needed .
euratex was reluctant to comment on the eu measures before being able to study them in depth , but an official said that " we 've been waiting since the end of the year -lrb- 2004 -rrb- for the guidelines as they have been published . " but british non-governmental organisation oxfam hit out at the eu measures , which it said threatened china 's reduction of poverty .
" european industry had more than a decade to prepare for the end of quotas .
they decided not to .
china should not be penalized because europe maintained most of the quotas until the last minute instead of having a managed phase-out , " said oxfam fair-trade campaigner phil bloomer . under the terms of china 's accession to the world trade organisation , its trade partners can take action to limit chinese textile imports during a transition period running until 2008 if they can prove that the imports are disrupting the market . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu facing damaging split over china while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 the trouble with nailing terror suspects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garnaoui 's trial : a lesson for future courts another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .
but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .
last year , abdelghani mzoudi , an accomplice to the planners of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks was bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's trial is still going on in hamburg acquitted by a hamburg court and mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , the only person worldwide convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks , won retrial because the court did n't hear crucial testimony . the acquittals have frustrated german government leaders eager to show that they are winning the fight against terrorism .
there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .
following the realization that the sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks were planned in hamburg , the government passed two security packages that eased the burden on prosecutors .
hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .
" it 's a strategy that is more promising , " he said .
" especially against terrorist or criminal organizations that do n't reveal themselves as such .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .

but there are other kinds of supercomputers .
they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .
but they are powerful .
quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .
it ’ s as if all the people in your town memorised a few lines of hamlet .
put everyone together in the town square , and soon , out of almost nothing , to be or not to be .
the eu is a kind of network : many separate countries , co-ordinating on a bigger project called europe .
maybe that ’ s why now ’ s a great time to build a supercomputer network on the continent .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .
" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .
not to worry , said one italian paper : " he has already performed a first miracle - all these people here for him . "
an icon of the sick because of his own illnesses , john paul ii was sure to be invoked often in the prayers of the ill . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mexican teen , heron badillo , said this week that the late pope cured his leukemia after dozens of doctors had abandoned hope that he could be healed . " since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .
few would say that john paul ii had not . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .

there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .

but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .

" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 the trouble with nailing terror suspects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garnaoui 's trial : a lesson for future courts another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .
but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .
last year , abdelghani mzoudi , an accomplice to the planners of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks was bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's trial is still going on in hamburg acquitted by a hamburg court and mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , the only person worldwide convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks , won retrial because the court did n't hear crucial testimony . the acquittals have frustrated german government leaders eager to show that they are winning the fight against terrorism .
there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .
following the realization that the sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks were planned in hamburg , the government passed two security packages that eased the burden on prosecutors .
hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .
" it 's a strategy that is more promising , " he said .
" especially against terrorist or criminal organizations that do n't reveal themselves as such .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .

mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .

teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .

john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.04.2005 china angered by eu textile import plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson still wants to be friends china has reacted furiously to new measures taken by the european union against imports of chinese textiles , calling the move a potential blow to the global clothing trade . the european union had on wednesday sought to soothe member states and industry concerns about surging chinese textile imports , while being careful not to upset beijing on the issues . eu trade commissioner peter mandelson unveiled " alert levels " to consider limiting chinese clothing imports but did not bow to pressure from the european textile industry to take more drastic action to hold back chinese textiles . the thresholds on such imports into europe could trigger an investigation to determine if so-called " safeguards " are needed .
however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .
" it will have a negative impact not just on sino-european textile trade , but on overall global textile trade . " end of quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sales assistants in a fabric shop display their merchandise in beijing .
the eu and us actions reflect a world coming to terms with the end on jan .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .
but now , the " krauts " seem to have found a way to get back at their british tormentors for decades of humorous abuse . " those crazy brits , " wrote german mass-tabloid bild in its thursday edition , citing a news of the world " interview " conducted by a psychic with the late princess diana .
it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

a big , metal apparatus , with flashing lights and whirring cylinders , wires spilling out , filling up the room .

they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .

quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .

proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .
" this pope is on the road to sainthood - our contact with him will be different but it is not finished , " archbishop jozef michalik , head of the polish bishops ' conference told reuters .
bildunterschrift : poles will press rome for status prolific saint-maker pope john paul ii was a tireless promoter of good works : he beatified 1,338 people and canonized 482 saints , more than all his predecessors combined since the modern process of beatification began in the 16th century .
after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .
" this departs from the spirit of free trade proposed by europe and seriously violates the basic principles of the world trade organization , " commerce ministry spokesman chong quan said in a statement on the ministry 's website .

" as a responsible member of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , china has taken a series of active measures to ensure the smooth transition to an integrated textile market , " said chong . " we hope the eu fully understands the efforts made by the chinese in this respect and cautiously handles the issue .

" you ca n't use export growth as the only measure for so-called ' market disruption ' , " sun huaibin , a spokesman of the china national textile council , told the afp news agency . sun said the measure was " worse than expected " and suggested it had no basis in global trade rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 the trouble with nailing terror suspects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garnaoui 's trial : a lesson for future courts another terror trial without a hard conviction this week has illustrated once more the difficulties the german judiciary has in putting terror suspects behind bars .
but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .
last year , abdelghani mzoudi , an accomplice to the planners of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks was bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's trial is still going on in hamburg acquitted by a hamburg court and mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , the only person worldwide convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks , won retrial because the court did n't hear crucial testimony . the acquittals have frustrated german government leaders eager to show that they are winning the fight against terrorism .
there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .
following the realization that the sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks were planned in hamburg , the government passed two security packages that eased the burden on prosecutors .
hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .
" it 's a strategy that is more promising , " he said .
" especially against terrorist or criminal organizations that do n't reveal themselves as such .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

german tabloids have jumped at the chance to ridicule the brits for a change . " do n't mention the war . "
british comedian john cleese 's famous line from " fawlty towers " has long been a synonym for jokes about uptight germans .

however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "

the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .

a big , metal apparatus , with flashing lights and whirring cylinders , wires spilling out , filling up the room .
and there are , in fact , computers kind of like that in the world .
but there are other kinds of supercomputers .
they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .
but they are powerful .
quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .
it ’ s as if all the people in your town memorised a few lines of hamlet .
put everyone together in the town square , and soon , out of almost nothing , to be or not to be .
the eu is a kind of network : many separate countries , co-ordinating on a bigger project called europe .
maybe that ’ s why now ’ s a great time to build a supercomputer network on the continent .
the project is called deisa , and now dr hermann lederer of the garching computing centre of the max planck society is going to take us on a quick tour of a very fast network .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

a big , metal apparatus , with flashing lights and whirring cylinders , wires spilling out , filling up the room .
and there are , in fact , computers kind of like that in the world .
but there are other kinds of supercomputers .
they ’ re called " virtual supercomputers " , and they don ’ t buzz and flash very much .
but they are powerful .
quite powerful indeed .
powerful enough to design new medications or predict climate change .
" virtual supercomputers " are networks : many different super computers , which co-operate .
they all store their data , and together , they can handle huge amounts of information .
it ’ s as if all the people in your town memorised a few lines of hamlet .
put everyone together in the town square , and soon , out of almost nothing , to be or not to be .
the eu is a kind of network : many separate countries , co-ordinating on a bigger project called europe .
maybe that ’ s why now ’ s a great time to build a supercomputer network on the continent .
the project is called deisa , and now dr hermann lederer of the garching computing centre of the max planck society is going to take us on a quick tour of a very fast network .

although the pope is n't yet officially a saint , mourners around the world are already calling him one and want church officials to make it a reality as quickly as possible . a popular clamor for pope john paul ii to be quickly canonized as a catholic saint erupted in st. peter 's square on friday toward the end of the funeral mass for the pontiff .
the crowd chanted " santo , santo " over and again , briefly holding up the ceremony , and some people held up large banners demanding the quick canonization of a man who created more saints during his 26-year papacy than all his predecessors together .
the pilgrims are jumping the gun and they do n't care .
it usually takes decades or longer to achieve sainthood , according to catholic tradition .
but people are impatient for pope john paul ii to get on that illustrious list .
" i pray the holy spirit will illuminate the next pope and help him to make a saint of john paul as soon as possible , " said liliana rosetti , 47 , a roman housewife who waited for hours to see the pope 's body told reuters .
" he deserves to be made a saint tomorrow for all he did . "
saints are those whom the catholic church proclaims to have risen with christ and are capable of interceding with god for those who call on their aid .
it is the highest honor the church can bestow .
according to church rules , the first step in the long road to sainthood does n't even start until five years after a candidate 's death .
that is because church leaders want time for emotions to cool and to collect evidence of sainthood .
pope john paul ii did bend the rules himself , however .
following the death of mother teresa of calcutta , he waived the five-year rule and allowed the process to begin in 1999 , just two years after her death .
if poland has its way , the rules will be bent for their national hero , too .

after the first step of " opening the cause , " the would-be saint gets the title " servant of god .
proof of holiness is then collected by a " postulator . "
then a " relator " evaluates the data and makes a recommendation .
the case must then go to a special vatican theological commission .
and if it approves , the pope can be deemed someone with " heroic virtues " and given the title " venerable . "
a miracle needed the road to sainthood begins with the attribution of one miracle to the candidate - usually an unexplained medical cure because of his intercession - which if confirmed leads to beatification .
it takes another miracle to become a saint .
not to worry , said one italian paper : " he has already performed a first miracle - all these people here for him . "

" since that day in 1990 , i 've been convinced that it was a miracle .
his holiness touched my face and kissed my forehead and head .
i was four years old , and i was very sick , but after that , i was healed , " badillo , now 19 , told afp . a nun in colombia , meanwhile , has said the pontiff cured her of an illness that affected her balance .
an exemplary life if some vatican insiders get their way , the need for proven miracles may be scrapped .
cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa and former secretary of the powerful congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said two years ago that what mattered was not whether candidates for sainthood had performed miracles , but whether they had displayed " heroic virtue " - led an exemplary life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .
last year , abdelghani mzoudi , an accomplice to the planners of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks was bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq 's trial is still going on in hamburg acquitted by a hamburg court and mounir el motassadeq -lrb- photo -rrb- , the only person worldwide convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks , won retrial because the court did n't hear crucial testimony . the acquittals have frustrated german government leaders eager to show that they are winning the fight against terrorism .
there has been talk of tweaking the legal system to lower the burden of proof in terror trials , something considered in other countries such as the united kingdom . " you find the same problems in english , american and french trials as well , " said albrecht .
" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .
but the testimony of two undercover agents , who were not present at the trial , was deemed too thin by the court .
his plans to carry out bomb attacks , though partly proved by the prosecution , were not enough for a harder charge .
" it 's clear he planned something , but planning alone is nothing , " michael rosenthal , the defense lawyer on the trial , told reporters , according to the associated press .
" what was missing was the start of the execution . " for kai hirschmann , a security expert with a focus on terror investigation strategy , the failure is another reason for germany to radically re-think its legal structure .
following the realization that the sept .
11 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attacks were planned in hamburg , the government passed two security packages that eased the burden on prosecutors .
hirschmann said that legislation needs another clause . punishing jihad-ism " we need to be able to charge people for sharing this jihadist ideology , which automatically leads to violence , " he said .
" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .
for the time being , said albrecht , lumping major charges like terrorism , with smaller charges might be the best way for lawyers working within the current system .
" it 's a strategy that is more promising , " he said .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .

" it 's a problem that every court has . " the difficulties lie in classifying a group of people who might share the same ideology or beliefs as a criminal organization .
after establishing that garnoui , who had visited afghanistan in 2001 and divorced his liberal german wife in 2003 , held extremist beliefs , prosecutors were unable to portray him as the ringleader of others with similar attitudes . two undercover agents too unbelievable police , who had been tailing him , broke into his apartment to arrest him on march 20 , 2003 , and found bomb-making instructions and mobile phones that they allege could be used as triggering devices .

" we need to treat jihadism in the same way we do national socialism . " such a major change would require an unusual alliance of the government and its biggest opposition party and is unlikely in the coming years .

but some experts say prosecutors are learning . when a berlin court on wednesday acquitted ihsan garnaoui on charges of trying to form a terrorist organization , law enforcement officials and experts rolled their eyes . in its decision , the court said that the 34-year-old tunisian , arrested by police in march 2003 , had planned " to commit at least one attack in germany using explosives , " but said there was not enough to convict him on charges of forming a terrorist group . but garnaoui wo n't be walking free .
using a strategy analysts say should be employed more in coming terror trials , prosecutors pinned him on charges of tax evasion , passport fraud and illegal possession of a gun .
the convictions earned him a sentence of three years and nine months and meant he would be deported after getting out of jail . " they did n't get him on the most interesting charge , but on a number of other charges , " said hans-jörg albrecht , director of the max planck institute for foreign and international criminal law . " they got al capone on charges like tax evasion , as well .
not on the more serious crimes he may have committed . " legal shortcomings in terror trials the strategy could show the way for a more effective way of prosecuting terrorism suspects at a time when the german judiciary is under pressure to produce some success stories , said albrecht .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings .

" going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .

the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger led the funeral mass recalling how the pope had appeared at a window in the vatican to bless believers on easter sunday , six days before his death , when he could no longer speak , the cardinal said : " our pope never wanted to spare his own life , but gave himself unreservedly for christ until his last moment ... now we can be sure that our beloved pope is at the window of god 's house , where he sees and blesses us . " tears for a " priest to the end " at the start of the ceremony , the pope 's coffin was carried by 12 officials from the basilica where his body had lain in state since monday and was placed on a carpet in front of an altar specially erected for the purpose . vatican swiss guards in yellow and purple uniforms and scarlet-plumed helmets stood by as catholic prelates took their seats , bishops in purple , cardinals in red robes that whipped about in the breeze .
an open red-bound new testament was placed on top of the coffin , its pages flickering in the wind . bildunterschrift : crowds pack st peter 's square on friday , april 8 the vast crowd began by applauding the arrival of the casket , but many began weeping while the sistine chapel choir sang gregorian chants . the requiem mass ended at 12:30 pm , drawing lengthy applause from the mourners .
after , as the coffin was borne aloft and headed back into st peter 's basilica for burial , the crowd applauded a second time .
and just before re-entering the basilica , it was held aloft and turned toward the square over which he had presided countless ceremonies in the past during his 26-year pontificate .
mourners wept and bells tolled as the coffin disappeared into the church a last time for burial in the crypt beneath . " our whole world will be different now , " 18-year-old beata from poland , tears rolling down her cheeks , told reuters .
" i do n't know what we will do without him to lead us . " and as even police struggled not to cry , people described this moment as " the best " of the past five days . " it was the power of all the waiting in line and all the sleepless nights and all the people 's love for the pope crystallised in one moment , " francesco podesta , a 22-year-old eonomics student from genoa told reuters . kings and commoners the italian news agency ansa , citing security sources , said an estimated 300,000 people had gathered on st peter 's square itself and a further 700,000 in the surrounding streets , watching the mass on huge video screens . the funeral brought together royalty such as prince charles of england and at least 70 heads of state such as german chancellor gerhard schröder with millions of ordinary mourners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder was among the dignitaries at the funeral among other leaders who attended were un secretary general kofi annan and afghan president hamid karzai , one of a number of muslim leaders due to attend , who hailed the pope as " a man with concern for all human beings . " also present was us president george w. bush , who clashed with the pope over the us-led war on iraq but who called him earlier this week " one of history 's great moral leaders . " millions of pilgrims came from john paul ii 's homeland of poland including president aleksander kwasniewski and his predecessor lech walesa , whose solidarity trade union movement was inspired by john paul ii to resist the then-communist regime in power in poland . it contributed to the fall of communism throughout eastern europe , in what historians say is one of the pope 's greatest legacies . " going perfectly " since the pope 's death last saturday , an unending sea of humanity has filed past his body as it lay in state in the basilica , dressed in red and white vestments .
after the deluge in rome , italian officials initially pleaded for mourners to stay out of rome .
by friday , they changed their tune . " everything is going perfectly , " guido bertolaso , the government-appointed commissioner in charge of the arrangements , told afp . hundreds of policemen were deployed just on the square and the main artery to the basilica while several thousand officers patrolled the neighbourhood . bildunterschrift : the casket containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried into st.peter 's square at the vatican , friday april 8 , 2005 , at the start of his funeral as security was buttoned down , rome 's second airport , ciampino , was closed to commercial flights until midnight friday , and a no-fly zone over the city itself was being enforced by italian and nato aircraft . over 10,000 police , military and paramilitary officers , including hundreds of marksmen , were being deployed .
teams with dogs patrolled . police said cars would be banned throughout rome all day on friday and that all public offices and schools would close . in illustrious company before the start of the funeral , vatican officials said that the pope 's body had been placed in a simple cypress-wood coffin inside the basilica .
after the mass , the coffin would be placed inside a zinc coffin , then into an oak casket , for burial in the crypt below the church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger , left , watches as the coffin containing the body of pope john paul ii is carried to st. peter 's basilica at end of the funeral mass at the vatican , friday , april 8 , 2005 .
john paul ii will be buried alongside some of his illustrious predecessors , in a tomb marked only by a simple slab in stark contrast to the ornately sculpted tombs in which many of his predecessors are interred .
the slab will be inscribed simply with the late pontiff 's name in latin , joannes paulus ii , and the years of his life , 1920-2005 . the pope 's only instruction concerning his burial was that he be interred in the ground , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro valls said this week , also laying to rest speculation that the pope would request to be buried in his native poland . the late pontiff will be buried at the site left vacant by the coffin of pope john xxiii , who died in 1963 but who was transferred to a vatican chapel when he was beatified in 2000 . john paul ii 's remains will lie between the tomb of paul vi and that of christine of sweden , the eccentric queen who abdicated in 1655 to convert to catholicism . nearby is the site where the first pope , saint peter , is believed to have been buried .
next to benedict xv lies the late pope 's immediate predecessor john paul i , who died after a brief 33-day papacy in 1978 . afp / dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland mourns national hero while thousands of pilgrims flock to rome , polish mourners descend on john paul ii 's hometown of wadowice and krakow to honor the passing of a native son and a national hero .

it appears many brits believe that diana is jinxing the nuptials from beyond the grave . they can hardly be blamed as the bad news about the wedding of the british heir to the throne and his long-time mistress just does n't stop . security glitch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at windsor has been stepped up ahead of the wedding on thursday , yet another glitch became public as british tabloid the sun revealed that one of its reporters had managed to sneak into windsor castle with a fake bomb .
posing as a delivery man , he drove around the grounds in a van without anyone checking his cargo , which included a brown box marked " bomb . " london 's metropolitan police , responsible for guarding the royal family , launched an " immediate inquiry " into the embarrassing breakdown in security , the second at windsor castle within two years . a great irony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a now wrongly dated flag in honor of the royal wedding on sale in windsor friday 's funeral for pope john paul ii was perhaps the biggest hitch , as the wedding was originally supposed to take place on the same day .
however , charles agreed to postpone the vows one day and travel to rome to attend the catholic leader 's funeral - a move described by some as one of the greatest ironies in the relationship between britain 's monarchy and the catholic church .
after all , it was king henry viii who broke with the pope in order to be able to marry a divorcee . as a result of the postponement , the royal party - devoid of many of europe 's crowned heads who have all excused themselves - will now have to rush out of windsor town hall after the ceremony as several other couples are to wed there later in the afternoon .
town officials refused to move the other weddings . of course , that would n't have been a problem had charles and camilla been able to marry at windsor castle as they originally wanted .
but even those plans had to be changed because under english law , licensing the castle for weddings would have opened it as a venue to commoners for the next three years . queen not amused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's not amused queen elizabeth ii , who will not attend the civil ceremony , is reportedly also upset about the date change as her mother was buried three years ago on april 9 . and weather-wise , things do n't look so good either : according to meteorologists , the couple will face heavy winds , rain or even snow and temperatures around six degrees celsius -lrb- 42.8 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . last but not least , charles and camilla might have to interrupt their honeymoon on april 15 , as the queen could ask her son to represent her at the funeral of monaco 's prince rainier iii , who died on wednesday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de camilla and un reform dw-world recently reported on un reform plans and the upcoming wedding of prince charles and camilla parker-bowles .

however , the action plan does not take the eu , which is trying to build up strong commercial relations with china , as far and as fast down the road to safeguards as a us investigation into chinese textiles , which has raised the ire of beijing . but on thursday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman made clear the eu move was unacceptable .

" we are pleased that the court 's decision confirms , once and for all , that the tracinda case lacked any merit and that all claims against daimlerchrysler relating to the 1998 merger were completely baseless , " jurgen schrempp , chairman of daimlerchrysler 's management board , said in a statement .
kerkorian , a las vegas casino magnate , had filed a $ 1.2 billion-lawsuit against the german automaker in the eastern state of delaware accusing daimler-benz of engineering a takeover , not a merger .
the suit against the german auto group was brought by kerkorian 's investment arm tracinda corp. kerkorian believes he and other shareholders should have received handsome premiums on their chrsyler holdings , of as much as 62 percent , but that he was denied a premium because daimlerchrysler billed the deal as a merger .
the tycoon was the largest chrysler shareholder at the time of the 1998 deal .
the case was heard by us district judge joseph farnan in delaware .
" we will continue to concentrate our efforts on making this merger a great success by implementing our strategy and optimizing our operations in the us , in germany and around the globe .
" we at daimlerchrysler remain committed to creating value for all of our shareholders . "
schrempp added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.04.2005 german groups fight female circumcision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy and model waris dirie has criticized germany on the subject following the publication of a survey that says many migrant girls are circumcised in germany , unicef and other groups are pushing for measures to counter the problem .
the emphasis is on information rather than bans . the united nations children 's fund , unicef estimates that around two million girls worldwide are forced to undergo genital mutilation each year .
the practice , that involves the cutting off the clitoris and other parts of the genitalia , is a tradition in 28 african countries and in some parts of asia and the middle east . but , what 's largely been ignored until now is the fact that the practice - imported by immigrants from those countries - is also carried out covertly in europe . that point was driven home when a study , surveying 493 gynecologists across germany , was released in berlin this week .
it found that 43 percent of the doctors admitted that they had treated circumcised women in their clinics .
every tenth gynecologist said he had heard of the practice being performed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in somalia demonstrate against female circumcision in august 2004 .
the results have provided groups like unicef and the human rights group terre des femmes with new ammunition to draw attention to the problem and demand more information campaigns and counseling offers to protect girls from circumcision and help the affected women . " in germany there are some 59,000 african women who originate from countries where female circumcision is practiced , " said eva köhler , wife of the german president and patron of unicef .
" that 's why we can assume that more than 20,000 circumcised girls and women are living in germany .
little is known about their situation . " a grey legal zone though genital mutilation is forbidden in germany and can be pursued by the law as " bodily harm , " many questions over the legality of the practice still remain unanswered .
for instance , doctors are allowed to break the confidentiality law in the case of a potential female circumcision .
but it 's not mandatory for them to report a case to the authorities , as it is in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waris dirie the fuzzy legal zone surrounding female circumcision in germany has drawn much criticism .
waris dirie -lrb- photo -rrb- , a model of somali origin who was circumcised as a girl and is the un 's special envoy against genital mutilation , bemoaned the loopholes in german law . in an interview with german daily der tagesspiegel , the 39-year-old pointed out that when girls who were born in germany were circumcised in the home countries of their parents , the parents could n't be prosecuted in germany .
such " circumcision holidays " have long been forbidden in france and england , dirie added . a recent judgment by the federal administrative court did try to clarify certain points of the legal situation : it ruled that parents could partly lose their right to custody if they planned on sending their daughters for a circumcision to their home countries .
however , the unicef survey proves that the practice continues unabated despite the court ruling . more information needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instruments of torture - a knife and blades in kenya that are used for female circumcision .
the brutal tradition has also thrown up medical and ethical questions for doctors in germany .
" circumcision is a major health risk , " said manfred steiner , president of the professional association of gynecologists in germany .
" it 's not just against medical ethics and the medical association 's professional code of conduct but also violates the law , " he said .
steiner added that the survey made it clear that doctors in germany too were in need of more information on the practice . more information is what all groups fighting the problem agree on .
eva köhler said that the " gruesome tradition " could n't be countered by bans alone .
" sensitized information and counseling is of great importance , " she , adding that the survey had shown that information and clarification about female circumcision were urgently needed .
" not only in the countries where the practice originates , but also here in germany , " she said . a more sensitive approach at the same time , experts in the field agree that more clarification has to be accompanied with encouraging immigrants to break the silence and taboo surrounding the topic . fana asefaw , a doctor from ethiopia who works in munich for the german chapter of the international organization " forward , " said there had to be a well-thought-out approach when it came to reaching out to the affected , keeping in mind the cultural differences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an african man in germany hold up his young daughter during an intercultural festival .
" our aim is to seek out the communities of the affected women and inform them .
in the beginning we had many problems - they would n't take us seriously , would n't open the door to us and discuss about the topic , " she said . asefaw added that for african women to feel understood it would help if women 's groups in germany dealt with female circumcision in the context of other problems such as poverty , suppression and lack of access to medical care and not in a sensational manner . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : courts can stop female circumcision of immigrants german courts may curtail the rights of immigrant parents living in the country if that may prevent their daughters from genital mutilation , the federal administrative court ruled thursday .

the pair of ospreys set up home in wythop wood in 2001 and have returned each spring , bringing up five chicks .
the female returned from a winter in africa this week , only to find a new younger male in the nest .
as the new osprey tried to impress the female , her partner flew in and appears to have won the heart of his bird .
visitors who travel to see the ospreys contribute around £ 2m to the cumbrian economy each year .
the new male bird was born in scotland and in july 2001 he was in the midlands as part of a project to translocate ospreys back to england .
over the years he has proved himself to be a good fisher and she wo n't go far wrong if she stays with him bill kenmere , rspb bill kenmere from the rspb said the old male seems to have won the heart of his partner .
he said : " our male arrived back yesterday morning and has been sitting on the nest with the female .
" the new male was still around early yesterday , but we have n't seen him since .
we have seen our male bring fish and the female took it from him and there have been a couple of mating attempts . "
he said the new male may now be out of the picture , or just around the corner planning another attempt .
mr kenmere said the old male has proved himself good at " putting fish on the table " of the female .
he said : " her old partner is a very good male , he brings all the fish into the nest and she will use the amount of fish as a judge of his success .

numbers are n't everything .
but not surprisingly , archbishops of canterbury are comparative lightweights in inter-faith relations .
there is common ground between the two churches , and for years they have been trying to find ways of showing a more united face .
during the pontificate of john paul ii there has been progress .
but it is less than many in both churches have been hoping for .
one seasoned religious commentator , clifford longley , writing in the guardian , said of the pope : " he was not intolerant of other faiths and creeds , always willing to give visiting anglican or orthodox dignitaries a welcome .
' too harsh ' " he twice led multi-faith pilgrimages to assisi .
but he left relations with other christian camps in some ways less hopeful than before .
he left relations with other christian camps in some ways less hopeful than before clifford longley " the rigour of his theology was too harsh : if the catholic church was right , the others must be wrong . "
prebendary dr paul avis is general secretary of the church of england 's council for christian unity .
he told the bbc news website : " the vatican 's official position has n't changed during these 26 years .
it has a number of bottom lines , and they 're all still in place .
the pope addresses the canterbury cathedral anglican congregation " it still does n't recognise the validity of anglican orders -lrb- the ordained ministry of bishops , priests and deacons -rrb- or of the service of the eucharist .
" and it still regards anglicanism as something that began 450 years ago , at the reformation , and not as a church dating back to the start of christianity .
" despite that , there 's been evident progress in some areas .
the anglican-roman catholic international commission -lrb- arcic -rrb- has continued its work .
" another body , the international anglican-roman catholic commission for unity and mission -lrb- iarccum -rrb- , is working on a summary of dialogue between the two churches over the last 30 years .
new problem areas " and i 'm sure local unity , at town and parish level , is very much stronger , because catholics have become full members of bodies like churches together in britain and ireland .
rome made it clear the decision by the church of england to ordain women as priests was a further obstacle to closer relations paul avis " they could n't have got involved unless the vatican had given its blessing .
" there are two new problem areas , though .
rome made it clear the decision by the church of england to ordain women as priests was a further obstacle to closer relations .
" and it has serious concerns over the ordination of an openly gay man as bishop of new hampshire in the us , though it has been reassured by the anglican communion 's proposals for dealing with the situation .
" so at the personal and pastoral level , there 's often a very good relationship .
but i think anglicans remain disappointed there 's been no movement on recognising our priesthood , or the validity of our eucharist . "
at a time when both churches face problems in persuading the world they have something to offer , that is hardly a ringing endorsement of their love for one another .

in an industry that has often blamed the internet for falling sales and " stolen " royalties , wilco have defied the doomsayers and used the net to their advantage .
the group have gone from strength to strength since making their fourth studio album , yankee hotel foxtrot , available online for free in 2002 .
" it 's just new technology , and it 's nothing to be afraid of , " tweedy tells the bbc world service 's the music biz programme .
" people are going to abuse it - they are going to pirate music , they always have done - but it 's the same thing as tape .
" cassette tapes were going to ruin music .
if you go far enough back , the radio was going to ruin music . "
wilco embraced the internet when their record label reprise rejected yankee hotel foxtrot because it was " not commercial enough " . "
when we streamed yankee hotel foxtrot , i do n't think we 'd even made money from records " jeff tweedy wilco shortly afterwards , wilco were dropped altogether .
the group bought the album back from reprise and streamed it on the internet for free , prompting around 200,000 people to download it .
but when they finally released the album on cd , they found sales had not been hit by the experiment .
instead , they had been boosted and yankee hotel foxtrot became their best-selling album .
they then did the same for their latest release , a ghost is born - which went on to sell more than yankee hotel foxtrot .
the group now regularly post free tracks , remixes and live concert recordings on their website . "
it 's a really wonderful way to keep a relationship going with an audience " jeff tweedy " people respond to our music - it became a grass roots thing , a word-of-mouth thing , " tweedy says .
" i do n't know how i 'd feel if i was in a band that could n't play live , or had no connection to a live audience .
" but wilco has pretty much been built around a live audience - that 's how we supported ourselves .
most of our income over the years has come from performing .
" so when we streamed yankee hotel foxtrot , i do n't think we 'd even made money from records .
" to us , it was really no difference - as long as people were hearing our music , they might want to come to the show and see the music , see the band . "
cd ' artefacts ' tweedy also says the group found there was " no perceptible difference " between touring after the release of a new album on the internet and a normal release .
" if one person figures out how to put -lsb- an album -rsb- onto a computer , pretty much anybody can have it , " he adds .
" it 's a really wonderful way to keep a relationship going with an audience that is n't dependent upon a record coming out every two years . "
but he also says he still likes " putting out artefacts " and many people who download the record also go out and buy it when it comes out on cd .
afraid the internet acts as both a library and a radio for the group , tweedy says - as they do not get much conventional radio play .
" on the internet , people have an opportunity to check out our music , " he adds .
" i think what the industry is really most afraid of is the fact that people can hear their product before they buy it , and discover that it 's not very good in a lot of cases .
" that 's terrifying to them . "

" people are going to abuse it - they are going to pirate music , they always have done - but it 's the same thing as tape .

when we streamed yankee hotel foxtrot , i do n't think we 'd even made money from records jeff tweedy wilco shortly afterwards , wilco were dropped altogether .
the group bought the album back from reprise and streamed it on the internet for free , prompting around 200,000 people to download it .
but when they finally released the album on cd , they found sales had not been hit by the experiment .
instead , they had been boosted and yankee hotel foxtrot became their best-selling album .
they then did the same for their latest release , a ghost is born - which went on to sell more than yankee hotel foxtrot .
the group now regularly post free tracks , remixes and live concert recordings on their website .

" so when we streamed yankee hotel foxtrot , i do n't think we 'd even made money from records .
" to us , it was really no difference - as long as people were hearing our music , they might want to come to the show and see the music , see the band . "
cd ' artefacts ' tweedy also says the group found there was " no perceptible difference " between touring after the release of a new album on the internet and a normal release .
" if one person figures out how to put -lsb- an album -rsb- onto a computer , pretty much anybody can have it , " he adds .
" it 's a really wonderful way to keep a relationship going with an audience that is n't dependent upon a record coming out every two years . "
but he also says he still likes " putting out artefacts " and many people who download the record also go out and buy it when it comes out on cd .
afraid the internet acts as both a library and a radio for the group , tweedy says - as they do not get much conventional radio play .

" i think what the industry is really most afraid of is the fact that people can hear their product before they buy it , and discover that it 's not very good in a lot of cases .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- online criminals challenge police bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 8 april , 2005 , 08:04 gmt 09:04 uk online criminals challenge police the net has not just changed the way that businesses work , it has done the same for organised crime too , a leading e-crime police officer has said .
detective superintendent mick deats , of the uk national hi-tech crime unit , said online crime groups can be more loosely linked and harder to track .
he added that online crime groups had become more noticeably professional over the last 18 months .
he was speaking at the e-crime congress in london this week .
crime spree mr deats , deputy head of the national hi-tech crime unit -lrb- nhtcu -rrb- , said that greater use of online shopping and banking was making the net a tempting target for organised crime groups .
" where there 's money there is organised crime , " he said .
information about the success of some organised crime groups broken by police operations reveal that in one case , the criminals made a total of £ 6m from phishing attacks .
figures released by the nhtcu show how much cybercrime is costing the uk .
in 2004 fighting viruses cost £ 747m , beating off net attacks £ 558m and online fraud £ 690m .
mr deats said there were an estimated 70 organised crime groups around the world concentrating on net crime .
big uk businesses lost more than £ 2.4bn to hi-tech crime in 2004 , the nhtcu said .
many firms that do a lot of trade online are also coming under attack from extortionists who threaten to knock a site offline unless they are paid a ransom .
" the more reliant a business is on the internet the more vulnerable they are , " said mr deats .
" and , quite frankly , many people pay . "
details about an operation against website attackers reveal that one gang made £ 1.3m in a 90-day period .
some of the organised crime groups starting to use the net had the same rigid , hierarchical structure seen in offline gangs .
" in those situations we know who to target and who is in charge , " said mr deats .
new species but increasingly the net was making it possible for virtual groups to get together to commit crimes .
typically , said mr deats , these groups brought together people who were experts in particular fields .
" these tend to be loose groups of specialists , " he said .
some developed expertise in writing malicious code to steal confidential information or to mimic bank websites .
others recruit and control ' bot nets - groups of hijacked home pcs that are used as spam and virus relays or to launch attacks on other sites .
" there are people that sell or hire their ' bot nets , " said mr deats .
" they are a marketable commodity in themselves , they are specialised and there are a lot of people doing that . "
these technical specialists typically link in with criminals to help launder the cash they gather from phishing or id theft .
" they all co-operate and interconnect and it 's a difficult group to tackle , " he said .
" it can be difficult to work out who 's in charge . "
" they may never meet and there 's no need for them to meet , " said mr deats , " so it can be difficult for them to provide information you need to progress the enquiry . "

detective superintendent mick deats , of the uk national hi-tech crime unit , said online crime groups can be more loosely linked and harder to track .
he added that online crime groups had become more noticeably professional over the last 18 months .
he was speaking at the e-crime congress in london this week .
crime spree mr deats , deputy head of the national hi-tech crime unit -lrb- nhtcu -rrb- , said that greater use of online shopping and banking was making the net a tempting target for organised crime groups .
" where there 's money there is organised crime , " he said .
information about the success of some organised crime groups broken by police operations reveal that in one case , the criminals made a total of £ 6m from phishing attacks .
figures released by the nhtcu show how much cybercrime is costing the uk .
in 2004 fighting viruses cost £ 747m , beating off net attacks £ 558m and online fraud £ 690m .
mr deats said there were an estimated 70 organised crime groups around the world concentrating on net crime .
big uk businesses lost more than £ 2.4bn to hi-tech crime in 2004 , the nhtcu said .
many firms that do a lot of trade online are also coming under attack from extortionists who threaten to knock a site offline unless they are paid a ransom .
" the more reliant a business is on the internet the more vulnerable they are , " said mr deats .
" and , quite frankly , many people pay . "
details about an operation against website attackers reveal that one gang made £ 1.3m in a 90-day period .
some of the organised crime groups starting to use the net had the same rigid , hierarchical structure seen in offline gangs .
" in those situations we know who to target and who is in charge , " said mr deats .
new species but increasingly the net was making it possible for virtual groups to get together to commit crimes .
online crime is proving lucrative for many people typically , said mr deats , these groups brought together people who were experts in particular fields .
" these tend to be loose groups of specialists , " he said .
some developed expertise in writing malicious code to steal confidential information or to mimic bank websites .
others recruit and control ' bot nets - groups of hijacked home pcs that are used as spam and virus relays or to launch attacks on other sites .
" there are people that sell or hire their ' bot nets , " said mr deats .
" they are a marketable commodity in themselves , they are specialised and there are a lot of people doing that . "
these technical specialists typically link in with criminals to help launder the cash they gather from phishing or id theft .
" they all co-operate and interconnect and it 's a difficult group to tackle , " he said .
" it can be difficult to work out who 's in charge . "
" they may never meet and there 's no need for them to meet , " said mr deats , " so it can be difficult for them to provide information you need to progress the enquiry . "

" the more reliant a business is on the internet the more vulnerable they are , " said mr deats .
" and , quite frankly , many people pay . "
details about an operation against website attackers reveal that one gang made £ 1.3m in a 90-day period .
some of the organised crime groups starting to use the net had the same rigid , hierarchical structure seen in offline gangs .
" in those situations we know who to target and who is in charge , " said mr deats .
new species but increasingly the net was making it possible for virtual groups to get together to commit crimes .
online crime is proving lucrative for many people typically , said mr deats , these groups brought together people who were experts in particular fields .
" these tend to be loose groups of specialists , " he said .
some developed expertise in writing malicious code to steal confidential information or to mimic bank websites .
others recruit and control ' bot nets - groups of hijacked home pcs that are used as spam and virus relays or to launch attacks on other sites .
" there are people that sell or hire their ' bot nets , " said mr deats .
" they are a marketable commodity in themselves , they are specialised and there are a lot of people doing that . "
these technical specialists typically link in with criminals to help launder the cash they gather from phishing or id theft .
" they all co-operate and interconnect and it 's a difficult group to tackle , " he said .
" it can be difficult to work out who 's in charge . "
" they may never meet and there 's no need for them to meet , " said mr deats , " so it can be difficult for them to provide information you need to progress the enquiry . "

in its world economic outlook , the international monetary fund said remittances beat foreign investment , aid and exports in magnitude .
inflows of $ 100bn for 90 developing countries in 2003 were up 25 % on 2002 - with a similar rise expected in 2004 .
but it warned that transaction costs are still too high .
unlike aid and investment , remittances have stayed high despite downturns in the world economy .

" my own belief is that south-south flows are a lot larger than north-south flows , " said world bank economist dilip ratha .
easing the flow governments in both host and recipient countries needed to do more to ease the flow , which imf and world bank staff have previously said is a key source of money for driving growth and development .
a typical deal to send $ 200 back to relatives in a migrant worker 's home country costs between $ 15 and $ 26 on average , the imf said .
some host countries are taking action .
the uk , for example , estimates the cost of sending money from the uk at anything from £ 2.50 to as much as £ 40 for a transaction involving £ 100 .
it has published its findings on a website , sendmoneyhome.org , in order to help equip people with the information to seek better deals .
high costs and a mistrust of official systems often persuades people to use informal money transfer mechanisms such as the south asian hawala network , the imf noted .
governments are often wary of informal networks , given their usefulness to money launderers and suspicions that they can be used to aid terrorist finance .
the imf said regulation of such networks needed to be " carefully thought out , so that these flows can be better monitored without causing them to dry up or go further underground " .

in its world economic outlook , the international monetary fund said remittances beat foreign investment , aid and exports in magnitude .
inflows of $ 100bn for 90 developing countries in 2003 were up 25 % on 2002 - with a similar rise expected in 2004 .
but it warned that transaction costs are still too high .
unlike aid and investment , remittances have stayed high despite downturns in the world economy .
the world bank in particular believes that the stereotype of money flowing from rich countries to poorer ones is only part of the picture .
" my own belief is that south-south flows are a lot larger than north-south flows , " said world bank economist dilip ratha .
easing the flow governments in both host and recipient countries needed to do more to ease the flow , which imf and world bank staff have previously said is a key source of money for driving growth and development .
a typical deal to send $ 200 back to relatives in a migrant worker 's home country costs between $ 15 and $ 26 on average , the imf said .
some host countries are taking action .
the uk , for example , estimates the cost of sending money from the uk at anything from £ 2.50 to as much as £ 40 for a transaction involving £ 100 .
it has published its findings on a website , sendmoneyhome.org , in order to help equip people with the information to seek better deals .
high costs and a mistrust of official systems often persuades people to use informal money transfer mechanisms such as the south asian hawala network , the imf noted .
governments are often wary of informal networks , given their usefulness to money launderers and suspicions that they can be used to aid terrorist finance .
the imf said regulation of such networks needed to be " carefully thought out , so that these flows can be better monitored without causing them to dry up or go further underground " .

it has long been thought that the diet can help to improve general health .
but a major pan-europe study of 74,607 men and women aged over 60 has shown closely following the diet can actually extend life by up to one year .
the study , led by university of athens medical school , is published in the british medical journal .
mediterranean diet high intake of vegetables , fruits and cereals moderate to high intake of fish low intake of saturated fats high intake of unsaturated fats , such as olive oil low intake of dairy products and meat modest intake of alcohol , mostly wine the researchers collected information on areas including diet , lifestyle , medical history , smoking and physical activity .
the men and women were each given a score based on adherence to a mediterranean diet , with higher scores for those who ate the most foods linked to such a diet .
the researchers found that overall a higher dietary score was linked to a lower overall death rate .
they said that a two-point increase in the score was linked to an 8 % reduction in mortality .
a three-point increase was associated with an 11 % drop in mortality and a four-point increase was associated with a 14 % drop .
this meant that a healthy man of 60 who stuck closely to a mediterranean diet could expect to live around one year longer than a man of the same age who did not eat such a diet .
the researchers said the link was strongest in greece and spain - probably because people in these countries followed a genuinely mediterranean diet .
uk lagging behind rebecca foster , a nutrition scientist at the british nutrition foundation , said diets in the uk were not as healthy as those followed by many of their european counterparts .
" although dietary surveys indicate that we are eating fewer calories , less total fat and we are beginning to see a reduction in salt intake , we are still not meeting the uk dietary guidelines , which are in line with the characteristics of the mediterranean diet .
" in particular , the mediterranean countries such as spain and greece eat a lot more fruit and vegetables and have a lower intake of saturated fat . "
however , she said the study findings could in part be down to genetic factors , rather than simply diet alone .
belinda linden , of the british heart foundation , said : " dietary studies are often difficult to carry out as it is hard to define which constituent of the diet provides the most benefit .
" but that should not put us off trying - it is vital that large and in-depth dietary studies such as these are carried out to further our understanding of the way different diets affect our health .
" this study adds detailed evidence to previous findings and confirms that this type of diet , containing all the essential components of the mediterranean diet , can be linked with prolonged life .
" importantly , however , the diet is only one part of lifestyle change needed to reduce coronary heart disease and we must also aim to increase our activity levels , control our weight and stop smoking . "

the researchers said the link was strongest in greece and spain - probably because people in these countries followed a genuinely mediterranean diet .
uk lagging behind rebecca foster , a nutrition scientist at the british nutrition foundation , said diets in the uk were not as healthy as those followed by many of their european counterparts .
" although dietary surveys indicate that we are eating fewer calories , less total fat and we are beginning to see a reduction in salt intake , we are still not meeting the uk dietary guidelines , which are in line with the characteristics of the mediterranean diet .
" in particular , the mediterranean countries such as spain and greece eat a lot more fruit and vegetables and have a lower intake of saturated fat . "
however , she said the study findings could in part be down to genetic factors , rather than simply diet alone .
belinda linden , of the british heart foundation , said : " dietary studies are often difficult to carry out as it is hard to define which constituent of the diet provides the most benefit .
" but that should not put us off trying - it is vital that large and in-depth dietary studies such as these are carried out to further our understanding of the way different diets affect our health .
" this study adds detailed evidence to previous findings and confirms that this type of diet , containing all the essential components of the mediterranean diet , can be linked with prolonged life .
" importantly , however , the diet is only one part of lifestyle change needed to reduce coronary heart disease and we must also aim to increase our activity levels , control our weight and stop smoking . "

it has long been thought that the diet can help to improve general health .
but a major pan-europe study of 74,607 men and women aged over 60 has shown closely following the diet can actually extend life by up to one year .
the study , led by university of athens medical school , is published in the british medical journal .
mediterranean diet high intake of vegetables , fruits and cereals moderate to high intake of fish low intake of saturated fats high intake of unsaturated fats , such as olive oil low intake of dairy products and meat modest intake of alcohol , mostly wine the researchers collected information on areas including diet , lifestyle , medical history , smoking and physical activity .
the men and women were each given a score based on adherence to a mediterranean diet , with higher scores for those who ate the most foods linked to such a diet .
the researchers found that overall a higher dietary score was linked to a lower overall death rate .
they said that a two-point increase in the score was linked to an 8 % reduction in mortality .
a three-point increase was associated with an 11 % drop in mortality and a four-point increase was associated with a 14 % drop .
this meant that a healthy man of 60 who stuck closely to a mediterranean diet could expect to live around one year longer than a man of the same age who did not eat such a diet .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- should people be jailed for graffiti ?
bbc news / uk graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine friday , 8 april , 2005 , 08:49 gmt 09:49 uk should people be jailed for graffiti ?
is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers . "
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging " rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss " patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk " the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions " karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england " jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used " don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england " this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such " catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk " prison is expensive and will not stop tagging " m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk " locking them up will only alienate them further " al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk " make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged " m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts " give the taggers somewhere to be more creative " m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .

graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .

i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .

if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .

give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .

the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .

jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?

we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .

some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .

a mess .

david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .
the royal borough of kensington and chelsea says it removed graffiti covering 50,000 square foot - the equivalent of 45 full-size football pitches - on private property alone in 2003-4 .
it sees graffiti as an " enviro-crime " , which , along with fly-posting , litter and dumped cars , blights its neighbourhoods and can pre-empt spiralling crime and anti-social behaviour .
the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?

the cost of cleaning up graffiti across london each year is estimated at £ 100m .
but in trendy ladbroke grove , by the famous portobello market , most passers-by saw a clear distinction between genuine street art and messy tagging .
tags are often scrawled over other graffiti few thought taggers deserved to be locked up .
yuri cardenas , 38 , of west london , said it would be better to force offenders to clean up the mess they had made .
he said : " i believe it has to be punished in some way but jail is too harsh . "
nardos michael , 17 , and her friend ferewaini habton , 16 , said tagging was " stupid " , adding : " there 's just no need . "
but they said locking people up for graffiti was " heavy-handed " .
nardos said : " i think community service would be more appropriate .
they could make them clean it up themselves . "
social worker ines berg , 34 , said she did not see most graffiti as a problem .
she said : " i think the kids should be given more space where they can do something productive with it .
it 's great .
why should n't the place be colourful ?
" if this happened , i think a lot of this silly nuisance stuff would stop . "
i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss patricia roche portobello resident rachel collingwood , 39 , agreed .
she said : " i like graffiti .
i think most people do .
i 'm just not so mad about it when they write their names over my front door .
" it 's grim enough looking at all these grey buildings , especially under the westway , so let 's have a bit of colour - just not on my door please . "
rudy gad , 37 , said the authorities should find out what young people were interested in and provide more activities for them to distract them from nuisance behaviour such as tagging .
" when graffiti originally came out in my school days in ' 84 or ' 85 it was done as an art form .
but the authorities tried to suppress it .
" tagging is just done by bored children .
if they like art so much then send them on a course for artwork rather than sending them to jail .
does graffiti brighten up the urban landscape ?
" if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging .
" a 12-month community service order scrubbing off tags would be better . "
patricia roche , 59 , of central london , said the idea of custody for graffiti was " dreadful " .
she added : " i like graffiti if it 's done well .
i do n't see anything wrong with it .
it brightens up the day sometimes .
" i just do n't notice the tagging , i do n't care about it and i do n't see why people make such as fuss . "
your comments graffiti is a valid artform , and often brightens up dull , lifeless concrete expanses that should never have received planning permission .
the bulk of tagging , however , is a pathetic attempt by those with no artistic ability to emulate graffiti art .
a simple law change could be implemented : tagging with one colour should be illegal -lrb- that would cut out 95 % of artless tagging .
graffiti on plain concrete should be allowed , but not on brick or stone walls , which are pleasing to look at in their own right .
dan williams , reading , uk i have had to arrange its costly removal from my property .
money i could spend on better things .
it 's a social crime against us all .
yes prison in extreme cases , large fines in all others .
if they want to tag do it to their own property .
mike newson , bristol .
with all the mess and corruption that goes on in the world how is graffiti such a cause for social concern ?
granted , mindless vandalism is one thing , but to ignore the creativity of culture is also .
if something is branded socially immoral , i think that it just makes it more appealing .
like the ' explicit lyrics ' motif on cd 's .
placey , macclesfied , uk the law the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions karen smith , london , uk of course they should be jailed .
as with anything in life , if you do n't own it , do n't abuse it .
i have no problem with art of any description , but it should be done on or in private property .
if you do n't own the property , permission should be sought .
if not , you are clearly breaking the law and should be punished accordingly .
if we excuse this because it ' looks nice ' where do we end ?
it is quite simple really , the law is the law and any such deviant behaviour should be dealt with accordingly with no exceptions !
karen smith , london , uk has anyone noticed that trains , buses , taxi , etc are all covered in adverts ?
why is it ok for megacorp to plaster its brand everywhere but it 's illegal for an individual to spray / scrawl / etch their equivalent tag ?
companies are given carte blanche to put their brands all over the place all in the name of money .
julian , london , uk graffiti is an art form - tagging is not , and there 's a big difference .
tagging is the use of pen and paint to scrawl the tagger 's " name " on anything and everything to mark territory .
if the authorities do ever catch these prolific taggers then they should certainly be locked up - they 're a menace to society and cost the taxpayer -lrb- i.e. me ! -rrb- sometimes tens of thousands of pounds .
lock ' em up .
j wooton , reading , uk until you have had your own property tagged -lrb- as i have -rrb- , you have no understanding of how depressing it is to have to remove it or live with it .
this is criminal damage and criminal damage is an offence under the law .
it is also not generally for ' art 's sake ' but an attempt at tribal boundary-marking by inarticulate vandals .
jill , brentwood , england jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used don , dublin , ireland is n't it time that our society realised that sending everyone to jail for the most minor misdemeanour is storing up trouble for the future ?
sending someone to jail for vandalism seems a tad harsh to me .
punishment has to fit the crime .
jail might be the easy solution , but surely there are better ideas and schemes which can be used .
don , dublin , ireland it really does make my blood boil when people suggest that ' tagging ' brightens up a grim , grey street .
how much improvement can you get by having an illegible scribble in black spray paint on the shutters of a shop ?
whatever next , obes for fly-posters ?
bubble , croydon people who damage or destroy property that does n't belong to them should know that they might face jail , whether they 're using a spray can or some other method to inflict the damage .
it might be more useful to society if they were instead made to clean up the mess at their own cost -lrb- in both time and money , -rrb- though .
helen , chelmsford , england tagging is rubbish , but real graffiti can be beautiful .
i see tagging as one of those antisocial things like litter and dog-poo on the streets , but it does not warrant prison .
that is insane .
i reckon it sparks up such vitriol because it is about expressing freedom , ruining the clean walls of others -lrb- at cost and inconvenience -rrb- and inducing fear of a spooky criminal presence .
ps .
always remember that concrete is ugly .
benn , brighton , uk i travel on the train daily and i pay a lot of money for my ticket .
why should some mindless thugs who do this get away with it ?
graffiti is the thin end of the wedge , it promotes fear , makes everything less attractive to business and tourists and costs a fortune to clear up .
as well as locking the offenders up they should be made to clean up the mess or sweep the streets for three months .
that would cut the re-offending rate !
tom jones , uxbridge , middx , england this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such catherine lawler , london the only way tagging may be described as an art form would be if it was done on authorised piece of material .
the majority of tagging in london is done on private and public property at the expense of the local councils and taxpayers .
i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

railway bridges and stations are favourites with taggers is jail the best way to deal with young people who scrawl their names over property , costing the uk millions of pounds in clean-up costs a year ?
one judge in manchester thought so - on thursday he sentenced two young men to 10 months ' youth detention for spraying their signatures , or " tags " , onto trains and bridges .
he said he hoped it would deter others .
the bbc news website went to one of london 's graffiti hotspots to see if people thought it was so serious a crime that it merits a custodial sentence .
the westway flyover , which stretches for miles over west london , has long attracted graffiti artists and taggers .
if someone who scrawls their name on walls is sent to prison with bank robbers and murderers , they 're going to come out doing much worse things than tagging rudy gad colourful artwork festoons the grey concrete arches supporting the dual carriageway and along the neighbouring underground railway track .
in some parts , local authorities and building owners have worked with graffiti artists , commissioning works and encouraging what many admire as a vital urban art form .
less admired are the ubiquitous and uninvited taggers , who have left their mark on almost every lamp-post , doorway , pillar , shop front and wall in some areas as well as etching their names into bus shelters and train windows .

i have lost count of the number of times that the wall outside my son 's nursery has been repainted by our local council only to be covered the next day with new ' tags ' , foul language and jokes about repainting the walls .
this is an environmental crime and should be treated as such .
let those bleeding heart liberals who believe this is an art form and those who commit the crimes fund the cost and the pain of removing it .
catherine lawler , london tagging is criminal damage and those convicted of it should be sentenced appropriately .
although jail should be reserved for persistent and prolific offenders , young and new offenders should be made to clean up their work and the damage caused by others .
graffiti art is n't to my taste but should be supported to the same extent as other art forms with lottery grants or taxpayers ' money as other art forms are .
perhaps there is even a market for this art ?
jim , london the mindless scrawling of a tag on a bus should invoke a punishment befitting the crime .
however if you look at the works done by people such as the rare kind crew in brighton , sometime proper street art can really be done on a level that people can appreciate .
in a world where we all struggle to understand why a sheep in formaldehyde is viewed as " art " , should we really be clamping so harshly on people with a genuine appreciated talent ?
jon klaff , london , england most people were n't offended by " old fashioned " graffiti which made a funny comment or was colourful and well designed and limited to a few sites .
tagging is different , it has no artistic qualities and it makes a mess of the environment in which it exists .
in our area , you see the same few tags time and time again on any available surface .
if left , it gives a message that " anti-social behaviour is tolerated here " and is very soon followed by vandalism , litter etc .
people then start to feel unsafe .
old people in particular find graffiti very upsetting .
instead of wasting money sending offenders to prison , why not print their tags on their foreheads using an indelible ink that will take weeks to wash off ?
brett hindson , raynes park , london no jail sentence - why would the taxpayer have to pay an extra burden for this type of crime .
community service - specifically on graffiti cleanup duty - would be an excellent compromise , although i do appreciate that a clean wall is a blank sheet to vandals .
we also have to make the distinction between art and vandalism .
chris gray , crook of devon , scotland there is to me a clear difference between tagging and graffiti .
tagging is art in exactly the same way as mugging is street theatre , and culprits should be forced to clean it up themselves .
proper graffiti , beautiful , vibrant street art , is a different thing altogether- and taggers respect it no more than they do anything else they scrawl over .
mikey , uk graffiti is an eyesore which costs big money to clear up .
the punishment should reflect this cost just as surely as if those responsible stole the money .
then there is the harm it does to peoples well being in the built environment .
graffiti makes me feel less safe so the punishment should also reflect this .
that said prison might breed hardened criminals so i think something more like 100 hours community service per graffiti conviction might be better .
simply cleaning up one 's own mess is way too easy .
roger , uk prison is expensive and will not stop tagging m dane , haverhill has our judges lost it ?
it costs less to put these taggers into the hilton hotel than into prison .
why not just make taggers clean their tags up with community service ?
prison is expensive and will not stop tagging .
m dane , haverhill if taggers are to be given community service cleaning off graffiti " tags " , then there needs to be a lot more publicity of what boring work it is .
one important part of punishment is discouraging others , and in the case of graffiti , this is plainly failing .
simon richardson , london , uk taggers are only doing what they enjoy , there is no in depth reason for it , to them it is art .
i think it brightens the city up , instead of seeing a city made of concrete , we get to see and enjoy personal art .
to place them with someone who has killed or robbed seems ethically wrong .
my advice to everyone is : there 's a lot of negativity in this world as it is , leave them alone ... it 's their passion , how many of you actually made an effort to fulfil yours ?
a , london britain is not a blank canvas for teenagers to spray over and anyone caught in the act should serve some sort of sentence to compensate everyone else who has to bear the eyesore .
i 'm pretty sure these taggers would not like someone else 's tag dubbed over their front doors , walls and windows so what makes them think the rest of us appreciate their ' so-called ' mindless efforts .
it 's simply showing off .
rakesh , west midlands taggers know the difference between painting a wall and putting cars and trains out of action .
they should have no doubt about the consequence attached to each .
if they can not pay for cleaning up walls that they have defaced with their art form , they could be required to apply their art form to the inside of their own homes in the form of variations on the theme of " i should not tag " .
by time they had cleaned the place up again they would have lost a lot of their enthusiasm for tagging .
j westerman , leeds , uk while living in paris , i and some others were invited by the local police to decorate the outside walls of the police station with -lrb- well-done -rrb- graffiti .
the chief of police evidently recognised the value of street art and identified a way to use it to build bridges between the police and the community .
tagging , on the other hand , is mindless vandalism and those who do it should be given community service orders compelling them to clean it up .
john , leeds , uk regardless how pretty some do-gooders may find graffiti the people who spray it on public and private property are ill disciplined , selfish and inadequate .
prison may be a bit ott but offenders do need to be effectively punished .
maybe if the police were capable of catching them corporal punishment combined with the requirement to clean the mess up might have a deterrent effect .
oh silly me the police appear only to be interested in persecuting the motorist these days .
bert , kent do n't jail them , make them clear up the mess they make .
if they 're under 16 make their parents / guardians clean up as well .
doug ditzel , croydon , england of course graffiti ' artists ' should n't be jailed - just made to spend a significant part of their lives cleaning up the results of their activities .
the work could be funded by a levy on spray paint , which would in turn drive up the cost and reduce the incidence of vandalism .
which makes me wonder : what proportion of this product is ever used for anything except graffiti ?
bradley , london tagging is mindless , irritating , potentially destructive and pointless vandalism .
do n't see them doing it to their own houses ... just other people 's property .
some graffiti is quite good where some mindless advertising is actually enhanced by a satirical comment .
but its transient anyway , painting walls is permanent .
painting on top of painting just makes a mess and that 's what it ends up looking like .
a mess .
i agree ... do n't jail em ... get them to clean their mess up .
rod , newhaven , uk locking them up will only alienate them further al , edinburgh graffiti is a positive form of expression that should be encouraged .
what kids need is encouragement to channel that into something more worthwhile , like graffiti in designated spaces .
locking them up will only alienate them further .
do the heads of those promotion companies who plaster our cities with fly posters end up in jail ?
i think not , yet they 're the ones who profit from making an unsightly mess .
al , edinburgh tags are now appearing on people 's cars and houses , and a stand has to be taken somewhere .
graffiti costs millions to clear up , money which could be much better spent on public services .
and in reply to rudy gad 's quote , how can you ' scrub off ' tags scratched into £ 45,000-worth of glass ?
david b , kingston , surrey the sentence passed for these youths was because they were etching their tags into the train windows - something that has been a growing trend on london transport for the past few years and quite frankly makes the buses and tubes look hideous and feel threatening .
it is vandalism , it is illegal and yes , those prosecuted should face a prison sentence .
if these people do n't want to risk prison do n't do it .
peter fuller , london , uk make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged m henning , kilwinning , scotland jail : no .
make the taggers clean up double the area that they tagged , and warn them that if they are caught again then the punishment will be double the area that they cleaned the last time .
also taggers to pay for the cleaning materials themselves .
m henning , kilwinning , scotland yes .
it costs my dept thousands of pounds per year to clear up this urban blight .
critical traffic signs are defaced , street nameplates obliterated , bus shelters covered .
at the end of the day the cost of this is borne by the council taxpayer .
not only jail them but also reclaim the cost of repairing their vandalism .
bill richardson , tyne & wear i do n't believe that ' taggers ' should be locked up if ' tagging ' plain slabs of concrete , but when they start ' tagging ' trains and other property they enter the realms of criminal damage and can cause thousands of pounds worth damages .
the people who do n't think they should be locked up would soon change their tune if the walked outside to find their car had been ' tagged ' i 'm sure .
john mothersdale , middlesbrough my neighbour spent all day carefully painting his wall cream .
the next day his house and front door was " decorated " with bright pink tags .
rather than jailing the vandals at taxpayers ' expense how about giving them corporal punishment ?
there 's no tagging in singapore !
peter , nottingham i 'm very glad your article makes the distinction between graffiti -lrb- which in my opinion is art and should be encouraged in certain areas -rrb- and tagging -lrb- which in my opinion is mindless vandalism with no artistic merit -rrb- .
i agree that being forced to clean up the resultant mess would be a fitting punishment .
if any artistic talent could be encouraged that would also be good .
john pendleton , lewes , uk having spent the last three weeks cleaning graffiti off my property , i believe that the best punishment would be for the graffiti idiots to clean up their own mess at their own expense .
it 's hard and unpleasant work that i should n't have had to do .
fred , oxford on the council estate where i live , almost every bit of wall is written on .
i hate this mindless vandalism .
it brings a depressing and threatening feel to the area .
peter benjamin , croydon , england a first or second offence should involve some community service , or even better cleaning the graffiti off .
a third offence and i think a custodial sentence should be given rod lora , wilts give the taggers somewhere to be more creative m , jersey , uk i think it 's a wasted talent and by no means should incur a custodial sentence .
give the taggers somewhere to be more creative , hold competitions .
i believe graffiti does in fact brighten up the grey concrete urban environment .
after all if someone can win the top prize in art using elephant dung why ca n't someone win it using spray paint .
after all art is all about expressing how you view life and the environment surrounding your life , and not be suppressed by people who are ignorant to this fact , ie government .
m , jersey , uk i hate and deplore it .
especially tagging .
i pass a thousand examples as i walk to work , i see peoples newly resurfaces homes blighted by spray paint and pen .
do you think that does n't negatively affect the people that live there ?
taggers need to be caught not ignored .
they need to understand the damage they do , they need to be made to pay for the damage they do .
this is a serious issue ; it is worse than noise pollution .
david , bristol , uk jail is a harsh and counter-productive punishment for the spraying of graffiti , but there should be strong measures to prevent and remove it .
not only is it usually very unsightly , but it gives an impression of lawlessness .
gareth , spalding , uk yes it is a pain to clean up - i let my son do his room in graffiti like decor !
but let 's not get stupid about it - prison is insane .
let 's make the ones who are bad at it do a clean up , but most of it is clever and brightens up really drab grey areas so on balance i am all for it .
peter , wareham dorset the majority of grafitti is just brainless tagging .
it looks a mess , is expensive to clean up , contains no burning social message , and requires only the combination selfishness , stupidity and artistic incompetence to carry out successfully .
anyone caught tagging who is over 18 should be jailed .
younger offenders should not be jailed , but they should be punished .
phil , london tagging is an art form so why should those with the talent to do it be jailed ?
all they are doing is showcasing there talents in the way its supposed to be seen .
jean-claude , london town to jean-claude of london town - whilst i agree with you that a great deal of graffiti is done by talented artists it is my experience that most ' taggers ' just scrawl something resembling their initials that has no artistic merit whatsoever .
in addition they often ruin genuinely artistic work by scrawling their rubbish over the top of it .
if tagging is showcasing talent then i guess the spider that just fell in my inkwell has several times the talent these people have since it is at least managing to come up with several different designs !
dave , uk if jean-claude holds tagging in such high esteem -lrb- " an art form " -rrb- , i suggest he commission these artists at his own expense and on his own premises .
modern art it may be , but quality stuff , an emphatic no .
let them keep their mess to themselves !

these are isolated giant galaxies that have grown over time - the result of mergers between galaxies in a group .
their creation may begin in the close encounter of two large galaxies which spiral together and then pull in all the smaller satellites around them .
fossil galaxies are now being studied using the latest generation of x-ray telescopes , according work presented at the uk national astronomy meeting .
researchers say the fossils ' cores are packed with dark matter , as well as some normal matter .
in fact , the concentration of mass at the centre of these systems is typically five times higher than in a normal galaxy of similar size .
mysterious dark matter has not been detected directly , but it can be inferred because it has a gravitational influence on normal matter .
the existence of fossil galaxies was confirmed in 1994 .
even so , astronomers actually know very little about them .
a group at birmingham university , uk , has identified six likely fossil systems using the us space agency 's -lrb- nasa -rrb- chandra x-ray observatory and the european space agency 's xmm-newton space telescope .
the team was especially interested in the galaxy ngc 6482 .
this isolated star system is the closest known fossil galaxy - being some 100 million light-years away in the constellation hercules - which allows it to be studied in detail .
the cores of these fossils have collapsed entirely .
" this gives us a clue that these are very old objects , " co-researcher habib khosroshahi told the bbc news website .
this must have happened at a time when the universe was younger and more dense , while the halo of gas and dark matter around the galaxy was acquired later on .
the team now wants to study fossil galaxies in more detail using data from chandra and xmm newton .
the royal astronomical society 's national astronomy meeting is being held at the university of birmingham .
